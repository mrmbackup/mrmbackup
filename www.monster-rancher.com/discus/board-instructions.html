<!-- The board administrator can certainly remove the following section.  We've made it up based on some of the common policy pages that Discus users have set up, and we're including it simply so you don't have to write your own if you want to use it. Excerpts of this have been adopted from Jaded and from Matt Kahn -- sincere thanks to both! -->

<A NAME=rules><P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Rules and "Netiquette"</B></FONT>
<P>
When writing your messages, please use the same courtesy that you would show when speaking face-to-face with someone. Flames, insults, and personal attacks will not be tolerated.  It's fine to disagree strongly with opinions, ideas, and facts, but always with respect for the other person. Great minds do not always think alike, and that's where the fun is! Also, note that messages express the thoughts of the writers, not the board or its moderators.
