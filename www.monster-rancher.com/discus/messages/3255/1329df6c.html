Here&#39;s how to get to the bottom of the last ruin: <BR> <BR>After the ruin arises, go through it, and discover that no decendant is there, with an empty hollow of a disk.  Aya suggest taht you return to &#34;Rihet Ruin.&#34;  Instead...go back to &#34;Aurora&#34; and to the monster shrine.  You will be informed of the sacred disk being stolen.  You will be asked to find it, and return it.  NOW, head to Rihet, and Aya will tell you of &#34;Milie,&#34; who is beating all of the trainers in the ruin.  She will take off, and that is your cue to find Milie.  Descend to the fifth floor of the ruin, and locate Milie.  she&#39;ll challenge you to a game for the disk.  Beat her, and you&#39;ll return the disk to the shrine.  In gratitude, you&#39;ll be allowed to unlock it, and will receive the &#34;RockDino&#34; for your troubles.  ALSO, the shrine keeper will give you a &#34;Disk?&#34; pendant.  Return to the last ruin, and when Aya takes off, place the &#34;Disk?&#34; in the disk hollow to open a new passage.  Take the stairs and battle your way to the <B>EIGHTH FLOOR!</B>  Here, you will face the &#34;Pharoah.&#34;  Defeat it, and its&#39; master, Tim, will appear to commend you of your accomplishments.  He will inform you that you could not collect all of the cards the first time through,but offers you an option.  Return to the past with him, and leave all of your cards behind.  Your decision!

 Okay, I&#39;ll answerr them all... <BR> <BR>A.&#41;  To go into the past, you give up all your cards and seal them in a disk. You then are forced to start the game over.  You must go into the past numerous times to complete the card list...that&#39;s the biggest drawback to this game.  However, once you get your Master liscence again, you can talk to Grandpa and battle him.  Win, and he&#39;ll take you back to visit the man that locked yoru cards up.  You&#39;ll be reminded that you&#39;ve been through this already, and with memories back, you can unlock the &#34;Huge Disc&#34; you are given.  This disc holds every card that you collected in the previous game. <BR> <BR>B.&#41;  The Mural in town is sort of a sub-quest to the game.  If you can collect all &#40;who knows how many&#41; pieces of the Mural, you are rewarded with a special surprise &#40;not going to ruin it for you  -_^&#41;.  If you have all the cards, the Mural, and the &#34;Old Paint,&#34; a &#34;mirracle&#34; will occur. <BR> <BR>C.&#41;  Ummm...read above?  I gave a detailed walkthrough of how to get to it, or so I thought.  Perhaps you are referring to how you get permission to enter the Last Ruin?  The answer is simple.  Talk with Cox, the guy you rescued at the beginning of the game, and he&#39;ll tell them to let you by.
