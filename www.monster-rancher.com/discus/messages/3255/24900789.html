 i&#39;ll be happy!  actually, contrary to the old glen campbell song, i got the phoenix already.  it happened earlier today. as you all promised me, having all the monsters turned cue and pabs from pathetic lew-sers to masters.  they even saved my bacon once when i lost to stolatos, but they both won.   <BR> <BR>my deck still has some weak points.  i&#39;ll be analyzing recipes, and comparing them with mine. <BR> <BR>in any event, roll the credits!  or as pixie would say, 0/&#43;%~!

 It consists of creating a team of three monsters, adding techniques for them, and creating a deck with them.  You draw five cards at the beginning of a battle, and the one that goes second gets the opportunity to throw two away, first.  For throwing a card away, without any intervention in being forced to so so, you&#39;ll receive a GUTS &#40;Groce Unit Totals?&#41;.  Every card has a GUTS cost assigned to it, and a few even have a side-effect such as &#34;total attck,&#34; &#34;withering,&#34; or &#34;cannot attack next turn.&#34;  This is where the big spice of the game comes from, as it forces you to design a strategy of sorts to make the team solid.  The overall goal of the game is to retreive the all-powerful &#40;rediculously pathetic&#41; status symbol of an elite trainer. <BR> <BR>Before you get the Phoenix card, you have to have all other main breed monster cards.  The card battles themselves take close to ten minutes, if you think it out like I do, and then there&#39;s dialogue to deal with, as well as tournament.  THEN, you get to go through what Torey is probalby beginning to find...or shall I say, NOT find!  Once you obtain Phoenix, you have to obtain all monster sub-types and skill cards to get the &#34;Ultimate Monster.&#34;  The downside to this is that the chance of the computer giving you a card that you could ACTUALLY USE&#40;!&#41; is minimal, and I believe that it is meant that you have to unlock from disks, because that&#39;s the only way to complete the story line &#40;either that, or it&#39;s that you need 3 Phoenixes to get the Dadge/Rascal/Holly/Tesca scenerio&#41;.  IF you manage to do that in five hours or less, you&#39;re pretty good!  It took me 8 hours to get the Phoenix card, and another 20 resetting when I won an A class cup and got pure breeds.  The other 20 was spent resetting after battling a person five times, and even after they changed their deck, I still didn&#39;t get a sub-type. <BR> <BR>The graphics are very anime &#40;usual for MR series&#41; and the gameplay is original...sort of.  As for the translation...DON&#39;T MAKE ME LAUGH!  A three year old could write better translation than half of the cards in this game.  Phraes such as &#34;Lowers GUTS moves that cannot used opponents monsters until next turn&#34; are littered throughout the game, and make it more of a puzzle discovering what the cards do than the actual game does. <BR> <BR>Finally, there&#39;s the cliche fact that virtually every lady in the game will hit on you.  While this isn&#39;t much of a complaint for the males, it doesn&#39;t exactly inspire much confidence in TECMO to know that Ellie has a crush on little Debbie across the street. <BR> <BR> <BR>To make a long story short, it&#39;s not a short game, but has little depth, and becomes tedious after you get the Phoenix card.  Wait for the price to come down to the high twenties, and then if you want it, go for it.

 jello, i agree with what eagle said.  to give you the short answer to the question, i have probably spent 20-25 hours in the last month playing the game, and another 10 hours in the lab getting cards from my discs.
