 I was watching my Dad play Battlecards II one night, and he was up against Dadge.  He was convinced that Dadge had a Mocchi sub-type card, and played him four consequtive times.  To no avail, it was not in the cards &#40;bad pun&#41;.  What we did discover was somethign that made both of us do a double-take! <BR> <BR>Dad played an &#34;Up Close&#34; card to keep the Mocchi from Dodging, and attacked with a Brow Hit for 5 damage.  The next turn, the Mocchi used &#34;Motch Ray&#34; against his Worm.  Strange as it would seem, the Worm only took FOUR damage from it!  Mocchi Ray does SIX damage, so this was either a side-effect to the &#34;Worm&#34; main-breed card, or it was a serendipitous glitch.  Either way, Dad got the card to kill off one of the others in one shot, thinking the Mocchi would be defenseless now.  As the AI would have it, Dadge drew ANOTHER &#34;Motch Ray&#34; card, and once again, it did FOUR damage, no six!  Dad took out the other mosnter with his Worm, thinking that he wouldn&#39;t get a thrid Mocchi Ray in a row...of course, if you know Dadges draws, you know that he gets them one after another about the fourth turn into the match.  Dadge, as luck would have it &#40;yeah, right!&#41; had the third and final Mocchi ray in his hand, and used it to finish off Worm.  The thing is that the &#34;Motch Ray&#34; had to be used THREE TIMES to kill it.  Is this a lucky glitch in my game, or is it in everybody&#39;s program?  Anybody else ever notice something like this happening?  It may only work with Dadge, but it happened a consecutive four matches, so it isn&#39;t just a coincidence.

 Could there have been the ENV card played that reduces damage from INT moves by 2 on the table?
