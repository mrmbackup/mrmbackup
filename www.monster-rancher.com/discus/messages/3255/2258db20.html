 Alright, a few helpful &#40;I hope&#41; hints, here. <BR> <BR>These cards, when used properly, can be some of the best in your deck, and can be the &#34;glue&#34; for your deck&#39;s theme, in many cases. <BR> <BR>First off, I got the impression from the manual or game that each player can have an environment card up and in effect at the same time. Whether or not this was just my misunderstanding, this is not the case. There can only be one environment card in play at a time, _period_. As soon as another is played, the previous is null and void. <BR> <BR>Which brings me to my first real tip. It might be a good idea to keep one or two environment cards in your deck, even if you&#39;re not sure you really need them in your deck. Because even if you don&#39;t tend to actively use them, some of the enemies have decks themed around an environment card, that can do a &#42;lot&#42; of damage to you or screw up your tactics unless you can get rid of their environment card. And so far as I know, once such a card is in play, the only way to get rid of it is to play an environment card of your own. <BR> <BR>Another thing to note is that a few of the environment cards have odd-sounding text, that isn&#39;t quite clear. Just to clarify a few off the top of my head, &#34;nice fight&#34; doesn&#39;t allow you to use any card that does damage of less than 3 or 4 &#40;I forget which off the top of my head, I apologize.&#41; &#34;Lock Tight,&#34; on the other hand, does not allow you to play any cards that do damage of over 3 points &#40;despite the fact that it says over 4 or 4 or less or some such&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Now for a few quick tactics that you can use with some of these cards, to give you some ideas: <BR> <BR>-Use a &#34;quick moves&#34; team, where the monsters use skill cards that take few to no guts, and thus do little damage. Then throw in &#34;Lock Tight,&#34; so that your enemy can&#39;t use all his high-powered cards. This can be very effective against decks using golems, worms, and such that tend to have mostly high-damage cards. <BR> <BR>-Use a team made up of golem, worm, etc. that tend to be big, tough, and use high-power moves. Then put in &#34;nice fight,&#34; and a few good defense cards, so that your enemy can&#39;t nickle-and-dime your monsters to death, and if they do get off a big damage-dealing move, you can defend against it.  <BR> <BR>-Use a team with good but guts-guzzling moves, preferably monsters with high life, so that you don&#39;t need to defend. Then throw in &#34;close up,&#34; which doesn&#39;t allow you to have any cards left over after the guts turn, or else they get discarded. If your enemy has weaker moves and low-life monsters that rely on defense, you&#39;ll have an advantage over them.  <BR> <BR>-Put the &#34;warp&#34; card into your deck and use a lot of moves that are targeted against aerial monsters, Like Jell&#39;s &#34;Jell Copter.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Those are just a few ideas to get you started, but remember, make sure your deck can hold its own even without the environment card, since your opponent can always play an environment card of his own to supercede yours.

 If you can&#39;t stand environment cards at all and your deck can stand on it&#39;s own in a fair fight, load up on Pray cards and block any environment cards your opponent plays.  You&#39;ll still need at least one environment card just in caseThe key seems to be the ability to switch strategies mid fight.  A deck that uses only one way to fight probably won’t win the champions cup.

 well, i&#39;m playing the game on easy, and i&#39;ve already gotten to d level, so in terms of tactics, this is a pretty low level suggestion.  i have found it helps me to keep track of where i am in the game to do my lab searches and card reconfiguration, then save, after i register for the official tournament.  then i am certain not to miss it, and i can jump right back in and get to playing cards.

 I have a strategy too add about taking care of those nasty defense players such as Nelson and isabella and especially stalotos.  A combo of monsters such as Mocchi Suezo and Dino will pretty much work out as mocchies thrust will almost guarantee damage including seuzos teleport and make certain you have 3 leap attacks with dino.  To get this too work effectively use a normal blockable attack such as tail slap and make sure you have enough guts to attack again with dino so you use tail slap knowing the opponent will use a defense card then you attack with a big heavy blow allowing it too hit and ko a monster in 1 hit.   <BR> <BR>This is very effective and it is my main strategy in defeating these players.  The idea is that they know that a mess of little attacks can mess them up bad so they will use a defense card eventually allowing themselves to open for your mass damage attacks.  This is a prime way too outsmart the defense players try it out you dont have too use these monsters but its easier in my oppinion! <BR> <BR>Good Luck

 I have a little comment about that, Suezo.  There is a large exception to your strategy.  What you propose will work on two of the monsters in both decks, however, the Black Henger of Nelson&#39;s and the Monol of Stolatos&#39; deck will block your attacks with the cards &#34;Shock Breath&#34; and &#34;Wall.&#34;  You have to find a way to get rid of those BLK defense cards first or you will not be able to break the defenses, no matter WHAT you attack with!  <BR> <BR>My &#34;Romantic Flair&#34; deck works GREAT against Nelson, and hasn&#39;t lost once to him &#40;though, there have been a couple close-calls.&#41;  The reason I think that my team was so effective was because, I not only stacked the deck with undodgable skill cards, I also added as many unblockables as the game would allow.  It still wasn&#39;t too many, but it was JUST ENOUGH to do the job against a defense player with BLK cards.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, my deck works with other types of players, as well, but oyu have to change the strategy for it to be successful.   <BR> <BR>Anyways, it sounds like I&#39;m bragging now, and I hate when I do that, so I&#39;ll stop.  Your idea is right on the money, Suezo, but add some unblockables...just for insurance -_^

 Your idea seems sound, Check out my recipie for my powerforce deck I just posted thats what I use to literally own defense people!  The cards in that deck are so powerfull that if you fail too have a defense card by the time I get about 6 guts well theres a fast ko =&#41; hey eagle do you use the chat?  Maybe I will see you there and we can talk strategy!
