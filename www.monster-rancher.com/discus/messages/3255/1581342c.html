 I completed all of the ruins &#40;unless there is a secret one&#41;, and I&#39;m trying to lure out a trainer from the fountain.  Someone please give a hint so I don&#39;t fall too far behind?

 After you beat all the main ruins and get master class, beat holly at all the ruins then go to the town and there should be a group of poeple come by boat and open a path to a place called the Old Ruins. To get through the poeple, talk to them and then go talk to Cox and he will give you permission to enter the old ruins. Hopes that helps a little^_^ <BR> <BR>Adios

 The mural pieces are scattered throughout the town, just look around.  In addition, you receive one piece for each new card &#40;each ??? slot that you erase&#41; that you obtain.  Once you have enough different cards, the disc stone in the mural will become obtainable and you receive the &#34;Big Blue&#34; monster card. <BR> <BR>Note: A quick way to get the cards that you need is to battle in an &#34;open bet.&#34;  Keep declining until the opponent trades for a card that you need.  Keep in mind that you must bet a card of equal value to the card you want.  Likewise, you can trade with the guy that gives you the Phoenix cards.  Phoenix cards may ONLY be obtained by collecting &#34;Feather&#34; items, then trading and providing the proper passcode to Mac.

 Do you mean after you&#39;ve completed and chosen to go back, or when you start the game over from scratch?  You can&#39;t get the cards back if you write over your save.  However, if you&#39;ve gone through the portal, you can get your cards back after reaching a certain class &#40;either Gold or Master, I forget which&#41;.  At this point, you will see a man standing to the right of the house that you take the paint.  Talk and battle the man, and he&#39;ll give you a large disc to take to the Shrine.  In it, lies all of your cards from the past game. <BR> <BR>Note:  Don&#39;t forget to pick up the &#34;Hare Hound&#34; card when you reach Master rank.  If not, you&#39;ll have to go through the game, yet again.  Of course, you&#39;ll probably have to do that anyways.  It took me 5&#43; games to get all of the cards.

 When you get BigBlue? The First time you play the game or when they send you back?

 The only requirement for a &#34;Big Blue&#34; monster card is getting all the mural pieces filled in by acquiring enough cards.  I think I received the &#34;Big Blue&#34; card my third or fourth time through.  Battling Holly &#40;&#42;sighs&#42; repeatedly&#41; for &#34;Feather&#34; items to trade for Phoenix cards will come a long ways to complete the mural.  I suspect that it IS possible to get the card before going back in time, but it would be quite difficult, considering there are five or six cards that I have never seen played by the AI the first time through, all of which you&#39;ll need. <BR> <BR>&#40;PS&#41;:  You&#39;re welcome ^_^
