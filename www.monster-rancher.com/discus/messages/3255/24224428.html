Tesca uses a very balanced deck.

 When and where do you battle Tesca? I&#39;ve been playing forever and have never seen him except for the  A-cup battles.

 I battled Tesca while I waited for Holly to interperet the &#34;monster tablet&#34;.  If I remember correctly, this all opened up after I beat the errantry guy at the fire dragon hq.  Dadge came to visit me at home and the story evolved from there.

 That sounds about right FJ. You beat Errow first, then, you do the Holly/Dadge thing to get to Tesca.

 Hmmm...I know I&#39;ve beaten Errow but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve beaten Holly and Dadge. I&#39;m in year 6 and I visit all of the places I&#39;ve opened so far and I don&#39;t think there are any more &#39;event battles&#39; left. I wonder if you can just miss some things.

 You can tell if you beaten Dadge or Holly by looking at your information screen-&#62;names.  There should be a total of 57 &#34;name cards&#34; you can get.  You won’t obtain them from tourney battles, only from event battles.  Next time you win a tourney, visit every single location on the map.  If you did indeed &#34;miss&#34; them, I&#39;d chalk it up to poor game design, not high enough rank, or not high enough difficulty setting.  Keep us posted!

 Keep in mind that you might want to visit &#42;all&#42; the locations, not just the ones that you think you can meet new people at. ;&#41;

 I&#39;m on easy, and got them all, so that eliminates difficulty level. I got them all around year 4 I think.

 The manual states very clearly that the ONLY difference between the difficulty levels is the quality of cards your opponent has.  I keep forgetting that. <BR> <BR>I seem to remember that Dadge showing up at my ranch with the monster tablet was the start of the whole Holly/Tesca story line.  Have you visited the laboratory and seen the first part of the &#34;Dadge Saga&#34;?  Does this sound right people?

 Labortory? I thought the only thing the Lab was used for was to get cards from cds. I&#39;ll go check it out!

 That didn&#39;t work either. But I did find out I haven&#39;t fought Holly or Dadge in an event bettle. I have 54 cards and I&#39;m only missing Holly Dadge and Tesca. I wonder why dadge didn&#39;t visit me?

 All I can suggest at this point is win an A-Class battle and visit everywhere afterwards including the laboratory.

 I have concluded that the &#34;event battles&#34; are ALL rank inducive.  I skipped one tourney, dropped back to second, and had to sepnd two and a half months playing pointless practice battles.  I&#39;m almost finished with year two, so I doubt the year has much to do with it.  That&#39;s what I dislike about this game most...You HAVE to battle in the upper class tournies to get anywhere in the game, after a while, and when you DO, it cheats you into aggravation with poor draws for you and triple draws for the opponent &#40;Ever notice how Stolatos is able ot play THREE STRAIGHT CONFUSION CARDS!?...AND STILL HAVE A BUSY TIME LEFT AT THE END &#42;bitter at the lack of random draw the programmers designed&#42;&#41;.  I wouldn&#39;t mind it so much if I were given an equal opportunity, but the only way to win yourney&#39;s is to either strip the opponent of his/her cards with &#34;Close Up&#34; or attack until they can&#39;t defend!  All computer opponents play with all 50 cards in their hand at all times, and it&#39;s really annoying that you can&#39;t win unless it LETS you.  I&#39;ve found that if there&#39;s a good sub-type on the line, they&#39;ll fight tooth and nail, and leave you nothing but crumbs to fight back with!...Oh well, you&#39;ll see all o my opinions in my upcoming review this weekend.

 I look forward to reading them Eagle. I forget that the opponents change decks in higher difficulty levels, but FJ...I think there I think there is something that else different between difficulty levels---I am almost entirely convinced that you CAN NOT get mixed-breed monsters in practice battles on Easy level!! I have played Jodi about 12 times in a row in practice battles, and she won&#39;t give up anything.

 You might want to go on and try others, then. It seems from what people are saying that they&#39;re starting to get their mixed-breed monsters from different characters from each other, and I know that I didn&#39;t start picking any up in practice battles until I decided to go around just for the heck of it and start battling some of the characters that I hadn&#39;t battled in a good while. Then, lo and behold, I start picking up mixed-breed cards from some of them... <BR> <BR>So you might want to go around and start battling the people you haven&#39;t fought more or less since you fought them the first time in an event battle. See if any of them give you anything. Just an idea. :&#41;
