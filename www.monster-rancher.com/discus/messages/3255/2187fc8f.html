 This could go to FAQ, but it&#39;s pretty simple to figure out without too much trouble. If you&#39;re sick of having the same monsters, and want new monsters to use, just fight in one of the class battles. Example, if you don&#39;t have Pixie, then if it is listed when you register for battle, fight in the Pixie Cup.

 Also, as far as I&#39;ve noticed so far, there is no &#34;entrance requirement&#34; for any of the classes I&#39;ve tried -- i.e. if you think your deck is mean enough, you can enter whatever class tournament has the monster you want.  &#40;Caveat: I haven&#39;t tried the Class A or B tourneys yet, mainly &#39;cause I&#39;m sure I&#39;d get my butt handed to me there.  C is pretty challenging.&#41;   <BR> <BR>Conversely, if you&#39;ve been winning C tourneys and there&#39;s an E-Class tourney monster you&#39;re missing, there&#39;s nothing to stop you from entering and getting it.  Now, your POINTS ranking may drop from challenging lower-level foes... and I have yet to determine the significance of that.  Could be that you need certain point levels for certain events to occur, which would explain why I&#39;m in limbo right now.

 I was wondering about the lower level tourney&#39;s.  I&#39;ve won an E class and D class so far, but I might want one of the monster cards in these classes later on.  In MR2 you lose fame for &#34;slumming&#34;, but that can easily be recovered.  I hope it&#39;s the same for MRBC II.

 I have noticed it too. Pretty early on, I went to a C Class tourney and won Monol cards, and then this A.M. I went to another and fought E Class to get Gali.

 If you look under &#34;Ranking&#34;, which is in the Information section if my faulty memory serves me correctly, you&#39;ll see yourself listed with a point total in relation to everyone else.  From the comments of some of the NPCs in the game, it stands to reason that the points are generated much the same way as in chess:  You gain points for winning and lose points for losing, but you gain more if your opponent is higher than you &#40;and lose less if you lose&#41;, and vice versa if your opponent is lower. <BR> <BR>Which means, of course, that if you face opponents lower than you on the ranking list YOU&#39;D BETTER WIN.  I lost in the Breeder&#39;s Cup &#40;dangerous, as Miller is always a mirror match&#41;, and my points dropped significantly.   <BR> <BR>Note that the &#34;random&#34; map encounters don&#39;t seem to hurt anything -- the points only seem involved in the formal tournaments, not when playing in the Church, Nelson&#39;s House, etc.  Which makes sense.

 Also, points are not the end-all in the ranking system. I have been considerably higher in points than I am now and I&#39;m still ranked #5 &#40;just whipped the crud out of the Dragon contest&#41;. To face off in the one-on-one contests you must win a tournament. I spent 4 weeks in practice heck because I had the Champion&#39;s Cup stomp me and everywhere but the Lab and the Ranch was a Practice Match.

 I&#39;m ranked number 3 w/ Espada at #1, &amp; Gustav at #2. It also seems that everytime I win a tournament now, I get to actually talk to someone at one of the buildings, and get more cards out of the fights. Practice fights usually give 3-5 cards.
