 Many of you who have played MRBC a bit have probably seen reference made to the UT/UM thing. Has anyone seen he/she/it yet? I really hope that Alfonse, Espada or one of those guys aren&#39;t considered the ultimate trainer, and that the Phoenix isn&#39;t Ultimate Monster. If this character does indeed exist, what would the qualifications be to get to meet him? I have a theory, and it&#39;s the only thing logical that I can think of: I think that you have to have EVERY card in your book filled in. Every Monster, mixed-breed, skill card....everything!! That poses a challenge, and you could just have to have all the Monster cards and sub-breeds first, so I&#39;m shooting for that right now, Any other ideas?

 I&#39;m not sure about an Ultimate Trainer... I may have seen reference to him and just forgot. I remember though that someone said that if you collect every card, you&#39;ll get an Ultimate Monster to fight for you. <BR> <BR>And all the skill cards isn&#39;t too difficult. Heck, I&#39;ve &#42;had&#42; all the skill cards for some time now, and still need 8 of the bloody sub-breeds, because I keep getting pure-breeds/repeat subreeds when I win the tournaments...

 I still have a few more skill cards to get, but I&#39;m working thru a stack of CD&#39;s now...hope to fill in some holes. I may check out Tecmo&#39;s site to see what they say.

 What about ranking?  The points and position seemed to have something to do with the younger trainers knocking at my door, and winning in tournament makes more and more of the BCB interested in your talents.  Maybe, in addition to having all of the cards, you need to be at 1st rank in order to unlock this &#34;Ultimate Monster.&#34;

 I was pretty dissapointed when I reached #1 rank.  Nothing happened!  I have noticed though that many of the other card players are switching over to different decks &#40;nelson from mastermind to dark lord, chaille from angel lesson to god lesson.&#41;  I don&#39;t know if this has to do with my rank or how many times I&#39;ve practiced against them.

 I noticed people switching decks too &#40;although the  <BR>names have changed, I haven&#39;t noticed any changes  <BR>in the decks themselves&#41; and I&#39;m only #4, so I  <BR>don&#39;t think that it&#39;s rank-related.  However, I  <BR>think the changes may have began after I won my  <BR>first A-class battle.

 A little update: I’ve got five sub-breed cards to go now.  Stone Dragon, Fairy Hare, Night Flyer, Anki, and Magna.  It&#39;s getting very annoying though getting the rest.  Anyone know of a guaranteed way to get an opponent to cough up a sub-breed card after a practice battle?  It&#39;s driving me nuts!

 we were talking about this at chat the other night, fj.  it is our least favorite feature of the game.  we ranchers dont mind difficult, repetitive tasks.  but when the outcome seems entirely random, it takes away a lot of the enjoyment. <BR> <BR>i was chalking up my difficulty to playing on easy level, but, if i recall correctly, you are not playing on easy.  what you are saying is it isnt much easier to get the mixed breeds on med or hard, eh?

 I think we&#39;ve generally came to the conclusion that you can&#39;t get mixed breeds from practice battles on easy level. On Medium level, Trickster reported getting certain ones from certain people, and I wonder if you have to fight other certain people to get a specific card.I haven&#39;t had a chance to play much over the past week, but I&#39;ve got to go to Kansas City for 2 weeks &#40;PSX is the first thing to get packed in the suitcase!&#41; and I&#39;ll have A LOT of time in the evenings to play it. Am going to go ahead on Medium level and see what I can come up with, and if anybody else gets it before me, I&#39;ll check before posting when I get back home.

 I, personally, still believe that it has to do with the starting team of monsters that you are given, as to which character coughs up a card. <BR> <BR>Cocochino has Fairy Hare, but so does Elizabeth.  Isabella has Mum Mew, but so does Zashini.  Leon has Suezo Mask, but so does Oswald &#40;the dramtic guy at the Church&#41;.  Sephore has Shell Dino, but so does Rosee, Fio and Pixie both share Night Flyer, and Espada and Totti both have Vesuvius in their deck, so I&#39;m betting one of THEM will give oyu something.  Also, Pabs had the Angel card for my Dad, and I got the Purple Jell form Racal, but neither of us can get the other&#39;s card from that player!  I think Jodi probably shares the Black Henger card with Nelson, and Daniel has Melon Suezo, I blieve.  Mocchi hasGentle Mocchi, Zita has the Corone card, and although I&#39;ve never seen him give it up, I think Alfonse has the Stone Dragon.  OH!...That guy that you battle in the Resaurant for a Naga card has a Bazula, I believe... <BR> <BR>As for getting the opponent ot switch decks...if you can get the card form them, all of your oppoenents should switch the deck the third or fourth battle &#40;in a row?&#41; and after that two or more battles should net you their sub-type monster card. <BR> <BR>These have been my findings, if anyone can shed light on the subject, please let me know, because I&#39;m sick of playing their switched decks repeatedly, only ot get nowhere and a few more over-stocked skill cards!

 Yes I&#39;m playing on the medium difficulty level.  Serves me right for not going on-line at night!  I&#39;m on the medium difficulty setting.  I won the phoenix in 1003 and its now July 1007.  It&#39;s taken me that long to get most of the mixed breeds.  So far Nelson gave me a Black Henger, Rosee gave me a Shell Dino, Zita gave me a Corone, and Ryan gave me a Hare Hound.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it though.  I did win an Anki last night in an A-Class battle!  Hurrah! I&#39;m down to four now. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also very close to getting a full compliment of the skill cards.  By that I mean at least three copies of each.  This too is getting a little annoying though.

 Whoops, didn&#39;t check that message for errors before I posted it. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;ve tried to get Cocchino, Elizabeth, and Claire to give me a Fairy Hare, no luck yet.  Pixie hasn&#39;t given me a Night Flyer yet, but I&#39;ll keep trying.  I&#39;ve given up on Alfonse giving me a Stone Dragon so I&#39;ll try some one else.  Does any opponent have a Magna in their deck?

 Have you tried that harry guy that picked on Alice and gave you the &#34;Golem&#34; card, yet? Try him, and Juras either gives a Golem-type of card or a Soboros, forget which.

 Thanks Eagle, I&#39;ll try him.  BTW, Elizabeth coughed up a Fairy Hare card so I&#39;m down to three.  If I can find a Monol charge card, Henger True Vision, and a Ghost hit card, I&#39;ll have at least three of each skill card.

 Zanishi should cough up the Monol card that you&#39;re missing, Nelson would have True Vision, Gutav will give you the Hit Card, and Alfonse DOES give you Stone Dragon, you just have to battle him about 15 times, 10 or 11 if you skip tourney. <BR> <BR>BTW, do any of you know how to get to battle Waldorf, Fujita, Matthew, and Bennelet?   Is there a special MCA group?  If not, why are the Name Cards even there, and why do they have win/loss records.  I&#39;m chalking it up to the fact that this game is totally unfinsihed from what it was supposed to be.  You can tell that from the ordering of the cards.  One page is only half finished, and the last one is missing one in the second row, and half of the third

 Thank you Eagle!  After a total of 12 battles, Alfonse did indeed give me a Stone Dragon.  Just the Night Flyer and Magna to go now! <BR> <BR>Tony:  After a couple of battles, Vijadela switched over to his &#34;Giant A&#34; deck.  This is an all golem team including a Magna.  Hopefully I can convince him to part with it.  Giant A is a tough deck though.

 Go after Pixie with an undodgable deck for the easiest Night Flyer.  I forget which Golem you&#39;ll get from Vajedla, though.

 My &#34;Knightmare&#34; deck &#40;Durahan/Dragon/Vesuvious&#41; makes short work of any opponent!  I&#39;ll have to post it later. <BR> <BR>Pixie gave me a night flyer after 9 victories.  Vijadela was the last hold out.  After 8 victories, he coughed up a Magna, completing my collection. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have to get Nitestash to store my dex drive save so I can share in my somewhat dubious triumph.  Gotta go, real world is getting a little busy right now.
