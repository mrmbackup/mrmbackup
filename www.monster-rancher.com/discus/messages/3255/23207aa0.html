after a week of posting, i was able to turn my attention to the actual game for a couple of hours last night.  here are some random observations: <BR> <BR>1&#41;  ive tried a few different teams, but so far im most comfortable with, and have the best shot of winning with, my original team of pixie, naga, and golem.  i&#39;ve spent some time redoing the deck, but not the teams yet.  of course i havent won that many monster cards either. <BR> <BR>2&#41;  Damn isabella!  i wanted that mew! <BR> <BR>3&#41;  played in my first championship cup.  our team&#91;the flying pigs&#93; got to the finals, but were routed there by stolatos and the boys.  i did beat nelson en route tho.  i saw what he was doing early on, and was lucky enough to have the cards to create a defended pixie to chip away at him. <BR> <BR>4&#41;  stolatos&#91;sp?&#93; is another story - something like nelson but stronger.  still, i had him down to a plant which had used his defense, and i had a grand end card to use, but my last cards were not attack cards, so i never got to use that strategy - the game ended with me having a grand end, and four def cards, and nothing left in my stacked deck. <BR> <BR>5&#41;  i cant see me playing this game as long as i have played mr2, but it is a <U>LOT</U> better than i thought it was going to be.  looks like i&#39;ll have some time to play this weekend, so i will report further whenever i feel like it!

 ok - here&#39;s the update.  i am in july 1001.  have 12 monster cards.  latest official tournament won is b level ghost, beat zita.   <BR> <BR>my strongest team is now a worm/hare/tiger combo.  i keep a lot of def, spe, and env cards.  the cards dictate my strategy, but about half the time i keep hare and tiger alive long enough to chip away at the other side&#91;sometimes hare does a little more, cards permitting^_^&#93; then worm ends up the survivor with a couple sidesteps and a lotta guts.  from that point on, i either go into a nelson-like shell, or store guts for worm&#39;s boffo pow attacks. <BR> <BR>not so much looking for advice&#91;although it is gladly and gratefully accepted&#93; as a peek into the future.  i am obviously at the point where i am going to take on more and more powerful players as the game gets more and more difficult.  where is this team going to go wrong?  what weaknesses are the top ten going to exploit?

 Where you&#39;re going to run into trouble &#34;in your Nelson-like shell&#34; maybe when you start storing GUTS having them withered away if you don&#39;t have the right DEF card. I found that the best way to avoid getting the &#34;environment&#34; changed, is to have a Pray card. That&#39;s the only card that blocks environments cards, and can keep things in your favor. I can tell you this, as a bit of a hint: Stolatos has 2 or 3 Confusion cards in his deck. If you have Pray, you can beat him in simple card conservation. If you can, take out his plant, because it will load you up w/ Toxic Nectar. Antagonize it w/low cost GUTS moves until you take it out. Good Luck!!!

 well, i found out an early answer to one of my questions - zita came at my worm hard with a combo early in the jell cup, and knocked it out ere its prime.  my hare and tiger were no match for her team, although i took it to the last card...i could have reasonably resigned before that. <BR> <BR>going to add a shell to my two sidesteps for the worm, and now that i&#39;ve gotten lock tight, going to reformulate a lock tight team. <BR> <BR>more reports as developments occur...

 Just a recap here...I am starting year 1001 now, and have half of the plates completed.  I am at C rank, but that CHEATER Isabella wouldn&#39;t &#34;bet&#34; the &#34;Mew&#34; card.  Cheating, lying, manipulative...Torey, she&#39;s as good a lawyer as you are, no offense...&#42;mad at Isebella and her wacky withering deck&#42;...Anyways, I&#39;m ready to move up to rank B, now to get Durahan, and I should be able to beat it by next year, at this rate ^_^ <BR> <BR>Cards obtained thus far: <BR> <BR>Starting Team:  Gali, Golem, Dino <BR> <BR>Suezo from Daniel <BR> <BR>Mocchi from Alice <BR> <BR>Naga from E class <BR> <BR>Tiger from Leon &#40;cool guy of the BCB&#41; <BR> <BR>Golem from Vajidia &#40;sp&#41; <BR> <BR>Monol from the C class <BR> <BR>Hare from Cocochino <BR> <BR>Worm from one of the Junior Fire Dragons...I think! <BR> <BR>Mew from Isebella...if oyu can get ehr to play fairly! <BR> <BR>That&#39;s been my luck, so far.  I do have a Q, though...what is the point of ranks in this?  I have 15 K.O&#39;s and 15 wins, and a guy with 4 wins is STILL higher on the pole...why?  what is the purpose of it?

 No problem, Torey.  Once I finish it up, which at my rate will be by Wednesday &#40;estimating&#41;, I&#39;ll post a full retrospect &#43; cross reference review. <BR> <BR>BTW, when do I get Plant and Zilla, and how many more times do i have to face that cheater before she coughs up the Mew card?  I want to put a team of Plant, Mew, and Naga together.  Meet MY withering team..MUAHAHAH

 Hey torey, one other thing to watch out for that I meant to mention - don&#39;t get to comfortable beating some of the decks of some of the tougher players, because when they go to a high level tournament, their decks might change. Alfonse comes to mind immediately, and so does Sephore. &#42;shudder&#42; Both their decks are a lot tougher in the A-class tournaments then if you challenge them out of the tourneys.  <BR> <BR>And yeah, you do eventually get the Mew from Isabella. I &#42;think&#42; one more fight will do it, but not positive. Plant and Zilla... hrm... .I forget where you get those. Although you can always go to the tournaments to get the specific monsters. :&#41; <BR> <BR>And as for the rankings, those are done by points, not by number of fights won/KO&#39;s. Plus, the points just seem to be won/lost in tournaments, so even if you have a lot of fights won outside of tournaments, that&#39;s not going to help your rank. It &#42;seems&#42; to just be your performance in the battles that counts. And if you lose in a lower class tournament than you should really be in &#40;or maybe it&#39;s just the ranking of the people you&#39;re fighting, not sure&#41;, then you&#39;re going to lose more points than otherwise, and win less when you win the fights.

 Okay, thanks for clearing that up, Trickster.  Newest recap: <BR> <BR>August 1, 1001 <BR> <BR>13 monsters, 15 total &#40;see above for duplicates&#41; <BR> <BR>Newest additions: <BR> <BR>Zilla from C class <BR> <BR>Dino from Sephore &#40;The jerk of the BCB. Why is it everyone mistakes me for him, I have burnt brown hair, for crying out loud&#41; <BR> <BR>Jell from the guy with the yello afro that has a crush on Holly <BR> <BR>Henger from C class <BR> <BR>2nd place Phoenix skill cards &#40;BLAST PABS, I beat Stolatos and I SWEAR he threw on pupose!  I TOLD THEM I WASN&#39;T READY, YET! The &#34;Rending Wing&#34; got their wings CLIPPED!&#41; <BR> <BR>As for my teams, they aren&#39;t fully developed, but here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been using <BR> <BR>A team:  Lightning = Tiger/Mocchi/Golem &#40;Beat Stolatos&#41; <BR> <BR>B team:  Talons = Gali/Suezo/Dino &#40;solid base team, no real strength or weakness&#41; <BR> <BR>C team:  Blackout = Golem/Hare/Worm &#40;Overall high damage, useless against speed-type decks&#41; <BR> <BR>D team:  Oddities = Henger/Jell/Zilla &#40;Working on this deck, bad chemistry thus far&#41;

 In my opinion...Rank C Team...Blackout...Dump the hare and put your Zilla in there!! Put some Pray and Lock Tight cards w/ no DEF cards for your team and enjoy it as you destroy everything in your path! I know this team may not work for you, as I know you enjoy Speed Demons, and these guys are far from that!!! I have a team like this, and they are super-destructive 34-0 since their inception last week.

 I might do that, Blackout is pretty powerful &#40;Just netted me the Dragon&#41;, but Hare alwats gets K.O.ed before the fourth hand, anymore.  Well, I&#39;ve been frantically climbing the walls beating these B rankers by the skin of my teeth.  Since they all have different themes, you need a well-balanced team to win, and as you said, I prefer speed demons coupled with a bodyguard. <BR> <BR>Latest news of Master Trainer Eagle Fierce &#40;drop the master ^_^&#41;: <BR> <BR>Feb 1, 1002 <BR> <BR>Newest additions: <BR> <BR>Pixie from D class <BR> <BR>Naga from Zevlez &#40;sp&#41; <BR> <BR>Isabella&#39;s Mew &#40;FINALLY!&#41; <BR> <BR>Plant from Matora <BR> <BR>Durahan from B class <BR> <BR>Pixie from Fio <BR> <BR>Zilla from &#34;The Tidal Wave&#34; <BR> <BR>Ghost from Gustav &#40;with some persuasion by Isebella ^_^&#41; <BR> <BR>Dragon from B class <BR> <BR>Getting ready to win a Dragon from Alfonse. <BR> <BR>Newest Deck:  Romantic Flair = Pixie/Mew/Naga &#40;this is probably one of my favorite recipies&#40;?&#41; as of yet.&#41; <BR> <BR>I have a few Qs to ask while I&#39;m writing this report. <BR> <BR>1.&#41;  The championship Cup is next month.  Am I going to be forced to lose again, or is there a way to make Pabs or Cue better at cards?  Is it all random? <BR> <BR>2.&#41;  Why is it that I can&#39;t get any cards that I want, but after winning them in tournament they practically throw themselves at you? <BR> <BR>3.&#41;  I haven&#39;t finished my business at the Church or Davis Restaurant...If I DO manage to win against the BCB and Stolatos, do I get to explore anymore, or do I put the card in the slot and get taken away? <BR> <BR>4.&#41;  Do I have to WIN sub-types &#40;ala MRBC GB&#41;, or am I able to combine cards? <BR> <BR>Thank you for all of your help.  If all goes well tonight, I&#39;ll be posting my review shortly.

 1.&#41; That depends. I too lost in the Championship Cup &#40;courtesy of Pabs&#41; before I had all the other cards in the plate. Next time, with all the cards &#40;except Phx.&#41;, Cue won all her battles, and then all I had to do is win. Pabs didn&#39;t factor in. I really think you have to have all 23, then, as long as you win, your team should win. <BR> <BR>2.&#41; Because Tecmo said so!! <BR> <BR>3.&#41; You will get the opportunity to fight them later, after the championships. There were 2 other people that I didn&#39;t meet until after I came back from Paradise &#40;the place where Colt got zapped to&#41;. One of the people was a big surprise to me! He was the last person I met, and I met him at the Jr. Fire Dragon HQ&#39;s. <BR> <BR>4.&#41; Unfortunately, you have to win them. I think they are only available if you win or finish 2nd in an A Class Tourney like Hero Cup, or Premium Cup. If you win, you get 2, if you come in 2nd, you get 1. <BR> <BR>Hope this answers some questions.

 Tony: Hrm... a Speed Demon type deck and a Zilla/Worm/Golem deck... now where have I seen that before...? ;&#41; <BR> <BR>And as to the questions: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Yes, I think Tony is right.. you need to have all the other monsters to have a chance to win the Phoenix card, then you just need to win your matches. Apparently, while Pabs knows monster breeding, he just stinks at battle cards. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t feel bad though... after a while, you&#39;ll probably end up with more Phoenix cards than you know what to do with. &#42;sigh&#42; <BR> <BR>2&#41; &#42;grins&#42; because it wouldn&#39;t be nearly as aggravating otherwise! &#40;And yes, this has started happening to me with mixed-breed monsters as well.. &#42;sigh&#42;&#41; <BR> <BR>3&#41; Yup, again Tony is right, when you get &#34;zapped away&#34; I think that&#39;s at least one ending of the game &#40;at least, the credits roll&#41;... but then, after the credits are over, you get put back in your farm one month later with all your cards, etc., and can pick up where you left off. <BR> <BR>4&#41; As far as I know, you also can&#39;t get any mixed-breed monsters until after you&#39;ve won the Championship Cup once. Then you can start getting them from tournaments, and I&#39;ve also seen a few people give them to you after practice matches &#40;!&#41; <BR> <BR>And as for the A class tournaments... you usually get 2 mixed-breed monsters if you win first place, but sometimes one will be a pure-breed monster again. Just what I need. <BR> <BR>Man, I &#42;really&#42; wish there were a way to trade some monsters.

 Okay, I give!  I&#39;ve been trying for the ALL DAY to beat Stolatos again &#40;won but Pabs lost last year&#41;, but nothing works!  I don&#39;t want to just outlast him, there were only two characters that ever got less than a K.O. from me, one was Gustav because he ran out of cards, and the other was Stolatos because I was able to outlast him.  I WANT REVENGE!  I&#39;ve noticed that the main players seem to have the same hand every time &#40;has anyone else noticed this?&#41; and I&#39;ve played aroudn with every idea I could think of.   <BR> <BR>My first idea was to throw out undodgables, which was the acheles heel of Nelson, but Stolatos still managed to outlast me, due to having to have a particular amount of GUTS &#40;usually four&#41; to be able to attack.  I then followed this idea up with with the card &#34;Close-Up&#34; as my ENV.  this worked well for a few turns, but as soon as I K.O.ed his Mocchi and Plant, he whipped out his &#34;Confusion&#34; card.  After a couple of turns using &#34;Shock Breath&#34; and &#34;Wall,&#34; the Iron Wall Stolatos was able to live up to his name with a remaining 1HP left on his Monol.  I&#39;m using my &#34;Romantic Flair&#34; deck of Pixie/Mew/Naga, and I can&#39;t think of a better team to beat him with.  What am I doing wrong?  Is it POSSIBLE to K.O. Stolatos?  He seems to get the cards he needs only when he&#39;s down on lives, monsters, or vice-versa.  Also, I noticed that if Stolatos fails ot make it to the finals and is defeated, Rascal will bash your head in with his &#34;Funky Dance&#34; deck, reguardless how many dodge cards you have!  I don&#39;t want to have to beat this  <BR> <BR>&#42;edited for the next five lines&#42;  <BR> <BR>by attrition!  I see that as a cheap win.  If anybody knows a way to K.O. the &#34;Iron Wall&#34; PLEASE post it up so that I might finally get revenge on the  <BR> <BR>&#42;edited for another five lines&#42; <BR> <BR>that has been driving me crazy all day long!

 Actually, I have far less trouble with Rascal than with most anyone else, mostly because we have the same type of deck &#40;no dodge, all offense&#41;, &#39;cept mine seems to be a bit better. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>As to Stolatos, well, personally I&#39;d try to outlast him. If you&#39;re going for a KO tho, &#40;or even sometimes if not&#41;, there are a few key points... <BR> <BR>Go for his plant first. He has very little in the way of dodge/defense for that thing, and it&#39;s what whittles your GUTS down. So you want to get rid of it as soon as possible.  After that, you might want to try Close Up to try to keep the dodge cards out of his hand. &#39;Til he gets Confusion out. Or try the undodgables, or just try to keep whittling away again and again and try to basically out-attack his dodges. <BR> <BR>There are also a few cards you might want to include in your deck for the fight against him: <BR> <BR>More than one Environment card. So that if he keeps &#34;trumping&#34; yours with Confusion, you can then turn things around on him. Hopefully. If you draw it. <BR> <BR>&#34;Pray.&#34; Only if you don&#39;t use &#34;Close-Up,&#34; obviously, because you need to have this in your hand. It keeps someone from playing an Environment card.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Busy Time.&#34; This allows you to set your &#34;cash in&#34; your GUTS that you have, and put an equal number of cards equal to your GUTS score from your discards into your stacked cards, setting your GUTS to 0. <BR> <BR>&#34;Good luck.&#34; This allows you to &#34;kill off&#34; one of your monsters, and get a number of GUTS equal to the life force that it had left. Useful for if that darn plant of his withers away your GUTS, or if he&#39;s been dodging you so much that you&#39;re about out of GUTS. it&#39;s also very useful with &#34;Busy Time.&#34; ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Oh yes, and if you do decide to try to outlast him, keep in mind that if you attack him, then he&#39;ll either have to dodge &#40;and use up a card, making him use another from his stacked cards next draw phase&#41; or take the hit. If you&#39;re doing this to outlast him, I&#39;d suggest that the attack card you use is the only card you use that phase, and you don&#39;t convert any to GUTS. ;&#41; Not that you really need to... he doesn&#39;t attack much, other than with his plant, so if it&#39;s KO&#39;ed you don&#39;t really need to keep GUTS around for dodging/defending. <BR> <BR>Hope some of that at least is helpful!

 it&#39;s the weekend!  time to play some battlecards! <BR> <BR>i am way behind all you guys - still have 7 monsters to collect before the pheonix completes my plate.  and its feb 1002, so i will go and lose another phoenix cup, thanx to my teammates. <BR> <BR>however, i am feeling good about my reformulated troisamies team all the same.  with pixie taking tigers place, i can play a counterpunching role.  i wait to see what the other side does, and wait for my opening.  if possible, worm and golem can rain devastating attacks down on them.  if not, i can withdraw into a def shell, with or without a &#34;protected pixie&#34;.  since i reset my deck, ive beating sephore and fio and the c zilla cup.  not the most ambitious of opponents, i realize, but i&#39;m easily satisfied! <BR> <BR>more updates as they develop.

 got to play about an hour today.  tweaked my troisamies deck a little.  beat metora the blaze and totti the tidal wave at practice matches.  now the flying pigs stand at the threshhold of our 2d phoenix cup.  with 7 monsters still to get, even though cue thinks i am stronger, and pabs thinks we will win this year, realistically, i am aiming for 1003. <BR> <BR>it is quite the role reversal for me to be the one feeding on advice, rather than giving it.  any descriptions of how you play and what cards/monsters are helpful/overrated is just gobbled up by me. <BR> <BR>here is one thing i learned, by accident, when metora whipped out her arid land card on me.  its better to have one monster with defenses and 8 lif than 3 monsters with 6 each, if arid land stays in effect.  obvious, but thats the level of my learning about the game. <BR> <BR>more reports as i see fit...

 Well, I FINALLY beat Stolatos, though, in order to successfully do it, I had to leave my &#34;brain over brawn&#34; strategy in the dust... <BR> <BR>I present to you, my newest deck that K.O.&#39;ed Iron Wall Stolatos <BR> <BR>Deck:  New Blackout = Golem/Dino/Zilla <BR> <BR>Golem cards:  3 Clutch, 3 Brow Hit, 2  Kick, 3 Throw Away, 3 Chop, 3 W-Chop <BR> <BR>Dino cards:  3 Punch, 2 Charge, 3 Tail Slap, 3 Flame, 1 Knee Kick &#40;my only one&#41;, 3 Fire Dash, 3 Bite, 3 Throw Away,  <BR> <BR>Zilla cards:  3 Roll Assault, 2 Belly Attack, 1 Scratch, 1 Tidal Wave, 2 Body Press <BR> <BR>ENV. cards:  2 Close-Up <BR> <BR>Any Monster cards:  1 Critical <BR> <BR>...As you can probably tell, I&#39;m not used to playing with power decks, and wasn&#39;t given much in the line of power cards by the other players.  Anyways, this is the deck that slaughtered the Iron Wall stolatos. ^_^

 WTG Eagle! I have power team &#40;courtesy of Trickster&#39;s recipe&#41; that is now 63-3! I can wipe the floor with just about anybody but Espada. He is a challenge still. I still recommend you get a &#34;Pray&#34; card or two in that deck to block Nelson&#39;s confusion card.

 Well, I haven&#39;t had much time to do more than pick at the game a little bit... mostly because the SO has completely claimed it as his own! Ah well, at least I know I&#39;ve got the edge in MR2 and get to keep it. ^_- <BR> <BR>Anyhow, he runs mainly with two decks: one known as &#39;Juggernaut&#39; and one known as &#39;Fastest&#39; &#40;obviously the upgrade of &#39;fast&#39; and &#39;faster&#39;.&#41; Most of his others were for playing around, though they&#39;re pertty successful as well. However, if we&#39;re sharing monster recipes, here&#39;s Thomas&#39; recipes. Make good use of &#39;em! They&#39;re both _quite_ successful. <BR> <BR>Fastest &#40;28W-2L&#41; <BR> <BR>Monsters: Pixie, Tiger, Mocchi <BR> <BR>Mocchi: Slapx3, Roll Attackx1, Thrustx3, Headbuttx3, Lickingx2, Petal Windx1 &#40;though he&#39;s planning on more to replace Licking&#41;, Rollx3 <BR> <BR>Tiger: Left Clawx3, Hornx2 &#40;no right claw at all, poor boy!&#41;, Chargex1, Ice Bombx3, Boltx3, Roarx1, Back Rollx3 <BR> <BR>Pixie: Scratchx3, Kickx3, Thunmderx3, Boltx3, Enchantx1, Stepx3 <BR> <BR>Breeder: Hot Battlex1, Lock Tightx1 <BR> <BR>Needless to say, a &#39;Nice Fight&#39; puts this out of commission pretty easily, unless he can get out his environment cards. <BR>-------- <BR>Juggernaut: 28W-1L <BR> <BR>Monsters: Golem, Dragon, Zilla &#40;gee! Wonder where it got the name!&#41; <BR> <BR>Golem: Brow Hitx1, Kickx3, Throw Awayx3, Chopx1, W-Chopx2, Rollerx1, Cyclonex3 <BR> <BR>Zilla: Scratchx1, Belly Attackx2, Tail Lashesx1, Body Pressx2, Roll Assultx3, Bubblesx2, Tidal Wavex2 <BR> <BR>Dragon: Tail Attackx2, Spinning Clawx2, Dragon Punchx3, Dragon Combox3, Fore Breathx3 <BR> <BR>Any Monster: P.O.x3 <BR> <BR>Breeder: Nice Fightx1, Busy Timex2, Bad Weatherx1, Arid Landx1, Close Upx1 <BR> <BR>The exact opposite of the &#39;Faster&#39; team, this one&#39;s made for... well, you can pretty clearly see what it&#39;s made for. Strips through cards like a dynamo, but tends to make a big mess out of things while doing it. Plus, the environment cards actually make it successful against the &#39;usual&#39; weaknesses of the &#39;Wall&#39; &#40;Blue Wolves&#41; decks and the &#39;Fast&#39; decks.

 Y&#39;know... I have to wonder if &#34;right claw&#34; is a rare card? In a long time playing, I think I&#39;ve only managed to get &#42;one&#42; so far, myself. And I remember Nelson at one point makes a joke about playing for one... anyone else notice a lack of this card, for some odd reason?

If you want Right/Left/Horn cards, just pick a match with Leon and he&#39;ll cough up one or two at the end.

 I&#39;ve kinda noticed while playing that you tend to get certain types of monsters cards from different people. I still need 1 Dragon skill card, and 1 Zilla Skill card. I think Alfonse is who I need to fight in a Practice Battle to maybe get the Dragon Card, but who do you think I need to beat to get the Zilla card?

 Tony, generally the characters seem to give the  <BR>skill cards that they use in their decks... from  <BR>there it seems a little random, though, in that if  <BR>you play someone with, say, a suezo/hare/zilla  <BR>deck, you seem to have just as good a chance of  <BR>getting suezo cards as zilla cards.  I think if I  <BR>was going for Zilla cards, I&#39;d try battling Totti,  <BR>but the other characters that use Zilla in their  <BR>teams at some point are Butcher, Bursy, Juras,  <BR>Claire-Yilis-Frederika &#40;all the same team&#41;, Dadge,  <BR>and Matora.

 One of the few cards, other than sub-types, that I need to complete the set is &#34;In Your Face.&#34;  I battled Totti for almost forever, but he never coughed it up. Since he&#39;s playing with an all attack deck, I don&#39;t think I can win a defense-like card form him.  Does anyone know who WILL give me the &#34;In Your Face&#34; card, because I&#39;d HATE to have to go back to C class, and let Espada ahead of me, just to get one uncommon card that the game is too stubborn ot provide.

 I&#39;ve received many &#34;In your Face&#34; cards from A Class tourney wins.  The cards you receive appear to random though so I&#39;m not sure if I can confidently tell you to just wait it out.  There&#39;s gotta be someone other than Totti that gives out Zilla cards...

 Try Juras, though you won&#39;t get many from him.  Also, I believe that the reason that I can&#39;t get the card is because it&#39;s one of the three or four that I&#39;m missing to light up all the plates.  Perhaps I&#39;m being too rough on the programmers sick idea of a joke ot keep you playing, though &#42;sarcastic smile&#42; ^_^
