 First of all, if you don’t have the desire or patience to run your opponent out of cards, you may as well stop reading right now and hit the back button.  Your just not going to end up KO’ing many &#40;any&#41; enemies with this deck.  Also, you’ll need a fair number of very rare monster and skill cards to perfectly replicate this deck.  However, if you have the time and cards, you can enter any battle, confident in the knowledge that you will win. <BR> <BR>Farmer Jimbo’s Plant Fire Deck <BR> <BR>Usuba &#40;Plant/Suezo&#41; <BR>3xRoot Attack, 3x Face Drill : Use to take out Jells and hares and to toy with your enemy later in the battle <BR>3xToxic  Nectar, 3xToxic Pollen: Wither of course! <BR>3xPower of Sun: Use with all of the above <BR>3xSide Roll &#40;suezo&#41; <BR> <BR>Phoenix &#40;Phoenix/Phoenix&#41; <BR>2xTyphoon,2xFlame Beam: Use to kill Jells and Hares and to punish stupid enemies <BR> <BR>Plant &#40;Plant/Plant&#41; <BR>3xTake the Hit <BR> <BR>Any Monster <BR>3xDodge,1-2xRetreat,2-3xGood Luck <BR> <BR>Breeder <BR>2-3xMango,3xConfusion,3xFainted,3xReborn,3XBusy Time,3xLock Tight <BR> <BR>Over all strategy is to have more cards at the end of the battle than your opponent, always keep this in mind.  Always watch your opponent’s guts.  Never let them get much above ten or you could be in trouble.  Never be afraid to convert an extra card or two if you have a fainted card and your enemy is way out ahead of you in guts.  Finally, don’t worry if your phoenix gets killed, you want people to attack your flaming chicken, that’s what the reborn cards are for.  I’ll post a couple of tricks against specific opponents later on.

 Good post FJ. Looks to be especially effective against Nelson and those kind of players. I assume it&#39;s pretty effective against the power teams if you keep the GUTS down.

 F.J., I admit that you have a fine-looking deck there, but I was just wondering...It looks like that deck would have a little trouble with power-hitters like Rascal.  If you don&#39;t get out the &#34;Lock TIght&#34; card early, what do you do?  I&#39;m not ragging on your deck or anything, just curious.

 Rascal and Totti are probably the most &#34;exciting&#34; opponents that this deck will face.  They key is usually the phoenix and withering.  Almost without fail, the enemy will attack the phoenix with some massively powerful attack that uses four or five guts.  That usually gives me enough time either play a lock tight, wither with fainted or plant attacks, or play a reborn and start the whole process again.  With Rascal, there&#39;s another wrinkle added with his d&#42;&#42;&#42; jell card.  He always seems to have all three of his riddler cards at the front of his deck.  I find that I have to kill the stupid jell before I start any kind of strategy. <BR> <BR>If all three of the lock tights are down at the bottom of my deck, I can survive the battle by dodging, blocking, reborn, and confusion.  The deck may appear to be a little short on defense cards but in fact, I never seem to run out.  The deck has a couple of major advantages over Nelson&#39;s.  The big one is the phoenix.  I almost always end up using at least two of the reborn cards against everyone except Nelson.  I&#39;m also helped out by the Plant and Usaba&#39;s big time life stats.
