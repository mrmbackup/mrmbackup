 Stage 60 <BR> <BR>Seriously, I do not know how to win this level. &#42;chuckles&#42; <BR>The easiest way is to get mocchi, than box up to the right/top part of the map, grab the key and use the mocchi&#39;s ability of invinciblity and dash to the end to the left side and win the game. <BR> <BR>Please do not lock this message, I&#39;m going to try out various methods on solving this stage, any help is appreciated.

 I&#39;ve found out how to win this stage. At the start of the stage, destroy the box right/beneath of you as well as the box next on the right to it and jump down to the metal ledge when the joker is not attacking. Once down, destroy the box you are standing on and as well as destroying the box on the right/beneath of you as well as the box left/beneath of you. After that, go to the right and destroy the box the flame is standing on&#40;make sure you don&#39;t make it fall to the ground.&#41; Box up till near the top and head to the right,and box all the way down. Once you do that, if the timing is right, follow the jell to the left. Can you see the flame box on the left part of the map? Destroy those boxes, and once the jell rush past you, jump over it. If you destroy all the boxes&#40;except don&#39;t destroy the flame box&#41; you should see a blue hourglass, take it to increase the timing left for the stage. Go to the left, destroy all the boxes&#40;if jell comes back, jump over him&#41; and box all the way up to the top. <BR>Once at the top, head to the right, you should eventually reach a place where you can see the door and on the right is a blue flame standing on a box, and beneath it is another box that will catch its fall. Destroy the box that will catch its fall by standing on the tip of the metal ledge. Once done, go back down to the bottom level and see the left flame, from there, box all the way up, so this time you won&#39;t get stucked. Once up, you&#39;ll see the friendly joker again and this time, go to the right, box up, grab the key and head left. First, you see a flame, destroy the box that it is standing on and it will fall to the box beneath that catch its fall, destroy the box on your right/beneath and go down, standing on the tip, destroy the box that catch its fall and head back up to where the key formerly was found at. This time, go back to the left again, making sure that you make boxes in the gap where you treaded on just now. Now you come across the second flame, destroy the box and this time, no box to catch its fall as you have at the start of this walkthrough, I told you to destroy that stupid box which catch its fall. Now box in its gap and head left to the exit. You should have ample time before you win this stage.
