 Well, I finally managed to get the Phoenix card  <BR>and won my first sunsequent A class battle- I&#39;m  <BR>now the proud owner of a Durahan-Dragon.  Is there  <BR>way other than winning the A class battles to get  <BR>sub-breeds?  In the shrine, or maybe winning other  <BR>battles?  Also, does anyone know how the worm&#39;s  <BR>coccoon/emerge moves work?  Every time that I&#39;ve  <BR>tried to use it I&#39;m told that I don&#39;t have enough  <BR>sub-breeds, or something like that anyways.  Has  <BR>anyone succeeded with it yet? <BR>thanks!

 I believe that you must use the &#34;Cocoon&#34; card on a Worm/&#40;insert sub-type here&#41;, then use the &#34;Emergence&#34; card on the Worm to get it to turn into a &#40;insert breed here&#41;/Worm.  That was my understanding, at least.  Although, why you&#39;d want to do this at all is beyond me!

 You can&#39;t get monsters from the shrine, and the only way I have gotten the sub-breeds is thru the A Class battles.

 Okay, here&#39;s my newest findings on these cards &#40;I needed something to get my mind of of Stolatos...I&#39;ll K.O. him some day!&#41;.  the Worm&#39;s &#34;Cocoon&#34; card is used on a Worm main breed only.  The &#34;Emergence&#34; card replaces &#40;metamorphasises?&#41;the cocooned Worm breed with a another monster that has a sub-type of Worm.  The &#34;Emergence&#34; card is placed over the Worm sub-type species and the Worm turns into that.  At least, this is my best guess form what it&#39;s told me.  If anybody has a Night Flyer or a Soboros, I&#39;d be interested on any testing you&#39;d do.

 Well, in between tourneys, I&#39;ve been doing  <BR>practice matches trying to get some of the  <BR>sub-breeeds, and while a got a few, none were from  <BR>any of the people that Trickster mentioned;  I  <BR>only got skill cards from each of them.  Maybe  <BR>winning the sub-breeds is more random than just  <BR>playing a person who has them

 It&#39;s also possible to get them from practice matches that you need to play at a higher level. I&#39;m at easy, and I too have played some of the characters that Trickster mentioned, but no luck either in getting cards from them.

 Hello all, I&#39;m back! <BR> <BR>I also won a Shell Dino from Rosse at the church during a practice match.  As soon as she gave me the card, she switched over to a deck that had a Shell Dino in it. <BR> <BR>I also won a Black Henger &#40;henger/monol&#41; from Nelson in a practice match.  I&#39;ve practiced against him before and only got skill cards.  This time though, I beat him at his own game and ran HIM out of cards.  He said something trite afterwards and coughed up the very cool Black Henger!

 that&#39;s interesting;  Nelson just gave me a regular  <BR>Henger... I wonder if it does have to do with the  <BR>difficulty level.  Maybe the easier the level of  <BR>difficulty, the easier it is to get the rare  <BR>cards-or the other way around.  But then again,  <BR>I&#39;m in moderate like Trickster and still haven&#39;t  <BR>gotten sub-breeds from the same people as him.

 Let me clarify:  I&#39;m playing on medium level and I already got a henger card from nelson earlier in the game from an &#34;event&#34; battle.  Nelson gave me a black henger card from a later &#34;practice&#34; battle.  I had already bested him in some earlier practice battles, but I beat him by KO both times and received henger skill cards.

 Here&#39;s my findings...Every time that I face someone five times or more, the deck switches.  Once the deck switches, it&#39;s possible to get the sub-type cards.  This is my personal opinion based on both mine and my Dad&#39;s game data.  I just hope that STOLATOS doesn&#39;t have a sub-type card!  I HATE that guy, despite his earnest demeanor.  Anyways, beat them five times or more and you&#39;ll see the new deck.  Whether the deck they play with dictates the chance of getting a sub-type card, I have no idea, though.

 GREAT INFO!!! We have some numbers to back up the theories now!! I will try this at Easy level and see if I get anything. If not, I may go to Medium and start from scratch...but I&#39;m not going thru 300&#43; CD&#39;s again!!

 Heheheh. Poor Tony, why not? I didn&#39;t think though that I had fought against some of the people from whom I got the cards 5 times yet in practice matches... I could be wrong, though. It might just be complete luck. &#42;shrugs&#42; Although if ya do find out something more concrete, Tony, let us know! &#40;Even though I&#39;ve stepped back from the game for a short while to be addicted to... er...

 I didn&#39;t get a chance to play last night, I started watching Room by Room on HGTV w/ my wife and forgot about it. Will go thru tonight, and see if I can get them to switch decks, and report back if/when they do. Eagle, a couple of questions: <BR> <BR>1.&#41; Did you have to play the same people 5 times in a row or 5 times total? <BR>2.&#41; Was it in practice battles or tourneys too that you count as 5 times? <BR> <BR>BTW Trickster--That was Gryphon39 that referred to you as a him.

 No Tony, five times total should suffice, and yes tourneys count, though I&#39;m not certain about practice battles. <BR> <BR>Ex.

 Well, it seems that I was mistaken.  It&#39;s three times, and I&#39;m now unsure if tournaments count.  nelson just switched to Dark Lord after I got the Henger card from him.  I&#39;ve battled Nelson at LEAST three times in tounrament, but he switched after I got the Henger card.  Granted, it was a practice match &#40;trying to win the Black Henger card&#41;, he upgraded his deck to Dark Lord.  because of this, I&#39;m going to go back on my last statement &#40;as much as I hate doing things like that&#41;, and say that three battles not including tournament will cause the opponent ot change up on you.  I apologise for my miscalculations.

 I have a feeling that it might be the actual time-schedule of the game, rather than how many times you&#39;ve faced someone. A high-level tournament tends to draw a high-level deck, fom what Thomas has seen. He&#39;s had a few folk that he hasn&#39;t faced but once &#40;AKA Stolatos&#41; in a tourney, and the 1K Wall went to the 10K wall in a later tournament. Plus, I&#39;m positive I saw him fighting Stolatos in a tourney later, and he&#39;d gone frmo 10K wall to _1_K Wall, since Thomas was in a lower tournament. <BR> <BR>I have a feeling it&#39;s by what tourney you&#39;re in, and/or how many points you&#39;re presently sporting.

 oh man, sorry about that, Trickster.  Its so hard  <BR>to tell these things through Monster Rancher  <BR>posts, and we &#34;she&#34; gamers generally seem to be  <BR>the minority.

I&#39;ve gotten a bunch  <BR>now, but still can&#39;t seem to win them from the  <BR>characters that Trickster mentioned, despite  <BR>winning many, many practice matches with them. &#40;I  <BR>battled Claire 10x, just out of frustration with  <BR>the whole thing.&#41;

 Nope... I&#39;m at the medium level- Trickster thought  <BR>she was at the moderate level too, so I don&#39;t  <BR>know.  It doesn&#39;t seem to have anything to do with  <BR>the number of times you battle the character,  <BR>either, which was what I had originally thought.
