This is my recipe for a team called &#34;Butt Kickerz&#34;. It is a modified version of Trickster&#39;s &#34;Solidarity&#34; team. It is simply 3 power-houses trying to roll over everyone in their path. The key cards in this deck are &#34;Pray&#34;, and &#34;Close-Up&#34;. The &#34;Pray&#34; card blocks ENV cards, which is especially helpful against Nelson who tries to play the &#34;Confusion&#34; card on you. &#34;Close Up&#34; means that at the end of the turn, all cards that aren&#39;t turned into GUTS must be discarded. That means, turn &#39;em into GUTS after your attack step! In turn, your opponent will have no DEF cards in their hand, because they had to turn into GUTS, or they get tossed. Anyway, here&#39;s the recipe <BR> <BR><B>Team Name:</B> Butt Kickerz <BR><B>Monsters:</B> Golem, Worm, Zilla <BR> <BR><B>Golem Cards:</B> Brow Hit&#40;3&#41;, Kick&#40;3&#41;, Throw Away&#40;2&#41;, Chop&#40;1&#41;, W Chop&#40;2&#41;, Roller{2}, Cyclone{1}, Recharge&#40;1&#41; <BR> <BR><B>Worm Cards:</B> Tusk Slash&#40;3&#41;, Pinch-Throw&#40;2&#41;, Roll Assault&#40;3&#41;, Worm Hole&#40;2&#41;, Poison Gas&#40;3&#41; <BR> <BR><B>Zilla Cards:</B> Belly Attack&#40;2&#41;, Body Press&#40;3&#41;, Roll Assault&#40;2&#41;, Sneeze&#40;2&#41;, Bubbles&#40;2&#41;, Tidal Wave&#40;2&#41; <BR> <BR><B>Any Monster Cards:</B> Critical&#40;1&#41;, Good Luck&#40;1&#41;, PO&#40;1&#41; <BR> <BR><B>Breeder Cards:</B> Busy Time&#40;1&#41;, Pray&#40;2&#41;, Close Up&#40;3&#41;

 That looks like a very powerful team!  How often do you use the busy time, poison gas, or roller card? <BR> <BR>On a side note, could we have a &#34;create conversation&#34; button in this sub forum?  I&#39;d like to post a recipe or two of my own, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d like to just tack it on to a discussion about Tony&#39;s Butt Kickerz team.

 Busy Time...Never...I should remove it &amp; put in another attack card.  <BR> <BR>Poison Gas...Occasionally...usually if I&#39;m down to one monster to beat, and it&#39;s 3 or less HP&#39;s, and I&#39;m low on GUTS. <BR> <BR>Roller...I&#39;ve used it a few times against Espada to take his Plant out. Does 12 Dmg. Plant is 10 HP. I only use it as a resort if I don&#39;t have a Zilla Roll Assault in hand and need to take out that Plant, which will lower your GUTS if you don&#39;t KO it early.

 It&#39;s been a hard lesson for me to learn, never be afraid to reevaluate and reform a good team.  When I build a team, I put the cards in I &#34;think&#34; I&#39;m going to use.  It takes battle though to &#34;know&#34; if you’re going to use them.  I always practice against Nelson, Espada, and Rascal before I&#39;m confident in the make up of a new team. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the button, looks like it works fine.

 I&#39;ve just been so wrapped up with trying to get these mixed-breed monsters, I haven&#39;t had time to re-do. They&#39;re now 78-3, and only losses were to Espada in A Class tourneys.

 Hmmm...I have more trouble K.O.ing Stolatos than Espada.  Once he switches to the &#34;Iron Emperor&#34; with the Vesuvius, you won&#39;t have ot worry about Plant, only excessive Durahan and Dino attacks.  I&#39;ve never lost to Espada OR Nelson!...I suppose that I&#39;m bragging tonight, though, so I&#39;ll just post my first and favorite deck. <BR> <BR>Deck = &#34;Romantic Flair&#34;  <BR> <BR>Pixie:  <BR> <BR>3 Scratch, 2 Kick, 2 Charge, 3 Thunder, 2 Bolt, 3 Lightning, 3 Step, 1 Soar  <BR> <BR>Mew:  <BR> <BR>2 Punch, 1 Head Butt, 3 Hundred Blows, 1 Miaow, 2 Zap, 1 Doll, 2 Scaredy Cat  <BR> <BR>Naga:  <BR> <BR>2 Belly Blow, 2 Stab, 3 Pierce, 2 Evil Shots  <BR> <BR>Any Monster:  <BR> <BR>2 Dodge, 1 Critical  <BR> <BR>Breeder:  <BR> <BR>1 Mango, 1 Hot Battle, 1 Confusion, 1 Lock Tight, 1 Pray, 2 Close-Up  <BR> <BR> <BR>Designed to be fast and accurate, this deck&#39;s only real downfall is that it is slightly expensive. It is quite flexible, and able to do some heavy damage...for a speed-type deck ^_^

 I just had to post;  I&#39;ve got two teams that I  <BR>use, but my newest one is working so nicely that I  <BR>thought I&#39;d share: <BR>my Radish team is Vesuvius/Durahan/Dragon <BR>With having just the two types of cards &#40;the  <BR>durahan and dragon cards&#41; that kick-butt  <BR>&#34;Combination&#34; card, with its 8 damage to all for  <BR>only 4 guts, comes up with the two cards &#40;&#34;Tail  <BR>Attack&#34; and &#34;Bite&#34;&#41; needed to use it much more  <BR>often than it would in a deck with three different  <BR>monsters&#39; skill cards.  Other than that, it relies  <BR>on &#34;Close Up&#34; to deal with those pesky dodgers and  <BR>blockers, and with the two durahans and their  <BR>inexpensive moves, we usually win very quickly.   <BR> <BR> <BR>Durahan:   <BR>3 cut-in-two, 3 flash slash, 1 millionstabs, 3 v  <BR>slash, 2 slash combo, 3 deathbringer &#40;once &#34;close  <BR>up&#34; is in effect and noone can dodge, having a few  <BR>cards that cause 8 damage and use only 4 guts can  <BR>wipe out any team very quickly&#41; 3 aerial shot, 3  <BR>thunderbolt. <BR> <BR>Dragon:  3 Tail Attack, 3 Bite, 3 Combination, 2  <BR>Wing Cutter, 2 Spinning Claw, 3 Dragon Punch, 2  <BR>Trample, 2 Dragon Combo, 3 Fire Breath. <BR> <BR>Any:  1 dodge &#40;just in case!&#41; <BR> <BR>Bre:  3 Close Up, 2 Pray
