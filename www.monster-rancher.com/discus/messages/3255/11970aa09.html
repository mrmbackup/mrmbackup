 I have played MRBCE2 until the death. I know it almost by heart. And after all these years of playing it, I have concluded that there are three cards that in my personal little opinion, are the most annoying in the game. <BR> <BR>They are: <BR> <BR>1--&#62; Hare&#39;s &#34;Loud Voice&#34;.- It&#39;s really annoying that you keep your DGE/BLK cards in your hand, and this stupid rabbit makes you discard one of them, risking the life of one of your monsters. Or you simply keep your cards trying to get your own game strategy, and this card comes to ruin everything! I get mad every time someone plays this card one me! <BR> <BR>2--&#62; Jell&#39;s &#34;Riddler&#34;.- This is the favorite of Alfonse the Dragon. Just before the &#34;Dragon Combo&#34; he plays this card to make you change all of your hand&#39;s cards. If you had been keeping you DGE/BLK cards &#40;or &#34;Retreat&#34;&#41;, it is quite annoying that you must discard all your cards. The worst thing is that they are stacked at the bottom of your deck! So if you had been keeping a card to dodge, block or simple strategy, it is not seen until you almost run out of cards. That&#39;s disgusting! <BR> <BR>3--&#62; Mew&#39;s &#34;Meaow&#34;.- This card is very annoying. First, it drains you all the guts you have &#40;not to mention it only cost 3 guts to use this card&#41;. Second, if you didn&#39;t disabled the option for FMV&#39;s of the battle moves, it&#39;s very disgusting to hear the &#34;meaow meaow meaow, meaow meaow meaow meaow&#34;, specially when you know that you have no cards to defend against this attack &#40;for example if you have a Golem, Dragon or Zilla&#41;, and when your stacked GUTS become zero! It makes me MAAAAAD! <BR>Pixie, Suezo, Zilla and Monol also have this effect &#40;ALL GUTS drain&#41;, but the FMV is not as annoying as a cat singing stupidly at your monster. <BR> <BR>This is MY OPINION. I&#39;d like to know yours.

I haven&#39;t played in a while, but I do agree with your assessment. It&#39;s really annoying to have a great deck, and a plan for using it, just to have it all blown away by one card from an opponent. Have you ever tried playing Jell&#39;s Riddler yourself on Alphonse early on?

I haven&#39;t played Battle cards, but this post intrigues me. As a HUGE Magic: The Gathering fan, I can attest that all your planning and building can be devastated by an opponents deck, by usually just one card. <BR> <BR>I personally see it as a learning experience, and don&#39;t view my match as &#34;stolen&#34; from me. Someone was better, or luckier, than I, and I congratulate him or her on a job well done accordingly. <BR> <BR>BUT I secretly plot the next time we battle, and which cards to add to my deck in order to smite my foe&#39;s!  :D

Also Cheto, feel free to post more about Battle Cards. I&#39;m interested in playing/learning about it, and don&#39;t see a terribly large amount posted here too often anymore&#40;even though it is an archive :P&#41;.

 Just so people know, this game can be gotten cheaply &#40;it&#39;s on clearance right now&#41; at amazon.com. It aklso shows up pretty regularly on ebay, and is well worth the money!

 I definitely agree with Riddler and Loud Voice. The third one, however, I think should be either Zilla&#39;s Bounce or Gali&#39;s Deflect &#40;or is it Reflect?&#41;. For example: you attack Gali with Henger&#39;s Burst Cannon. He uses Deflect or Reflect &#40;whichever it is&#41;and Henger gets K.O.ed. Isn&#39;t that so much &#42;fun&#42;?

 I think that Pixie&#39;s step &#40;and soar&#41; is really annoying because most opponents with a Pixie have 3 Dodges, 3 steps, and 3 Soars and then they use all three of the dodges to dodge every FRIGGIN attack i use!!! Must...Kill...Pixies!!!

 first off id like to say that how could you hate mew singing that is my favorite attack when i play with the animation on though i suppose it could get annoying when your oppenent plays it then i would like to say that confusion can be one of the most annoying cards in any card game i have ever played i have played magic since i was four years old when my dad tought me and if there was a card like that it would be banned automatically from tournament use plus i hate it when stolatos plays it and i dont have a pray in my hand it could sircely wittle down your decks stratgey if cuts off the right two cards

 Get a Dex Drive, it can often read corrupted cards and retrieve &#39;lost&#39; files! Don&#39;t re-format the card yet!
