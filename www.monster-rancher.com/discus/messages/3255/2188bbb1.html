 I owuld have to go with the Mocchi Petal Swirl. It takes 2 pts. away from each monster it hits, and is seldomly dodged.

 Yeah, it&#39;s the same as Gali&#39;s fire wall but costs one less guts point &#40;three instead of four&#41;.  In fact, mocchi is a very guts friendly monster all the way around.  Attacks and blocks that cost 0 &#40;as in zero&#41; guts.  Very effective.  The problem with petal swirl is you only start with one of these cards &#40;at least that’s all I have&#41;.  My Gali started with three fire walls! <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t want to sound like a broken record here, but try a combo with critical and petal swirl.  Five guts for twelve damage! Yes!

 The bad thing about the Zero Cost attacks IMHO, is that they do very little damage. I usually turn them into Guts for a hopefully more effective attack. I gotta get that Critical card in my deck when I battle. It sounds pretty effective. BTW, I have 3 Petal Swirls now.

 I don&#39;t have the second episode, I&#39;ll admit that right now, but on the GB Version, my favorite combination was Tiger&#39;s ultimate combo.  Use Left Claw, Right Claw, and Horn for a total of seven damage, and it costs zero guts to use.  I don&#39;t think you could touch that with a stick! ^_^

 You can use that same combo on this one, but I&#39;m not sure of guts cost of Horn. I haven&#39;t been able to use it yet due to not having the cards in my hands at same time, and I&#39;m a Guts whore. OK...here it is Horn is 0 Guts too. I&#39;ll have to try it. That sounds like a good Combo move. I was wrong earlier. The move I am using w/ my MOcchi that is doing 2 damage per monster that doesn&#39;t block or dodge is Petal Wind, not Petal Swirl &#40;I&#39;m still in MR2 mode I guess&#41;.

 My new favorite card is Lock Tight.  It&#39;s an environment card that prevents anyone from attacking with a move that takes more than three damage.  Combined with my Tiger, Mocchi, and Gali team, I just peck away while the other team accumulates guts.  The Golem and Zilla are absolutely useless when this card is in effect.  The only problem has been WHEN it turns up in the deck, and if the other player has his/her own environment card to cancel lock tight.

 Especially if the other player uses Nice Fight to eliminate about 80% of the Tiger/Mocchi arsenal... <BR> <BR>Petal Wind is great early on, but loses some charm when you get up in the ranks and half your opponents start carrying Retreat cards.  The Hare&#39;s &#34;Gas&#34; is fundamentally similar in all ways, but the Hare is a lot easier to KO and has more effective offensive moves it can use before then. <BR> <BR>The Mew has some NASTY undodgeables, if you can keep it alive long enough to use them.  In fact, the Mew&#39;s about as perfect a Pixie-killer as there is out there.   <BR> <BR>My favorite right now is the Dino card &#40;forget the name -- Leap Kick?&#41; that makes any Dino POW move it&#39;s comboed with undodgeable.  &#40;Not unblockable, though.&#41;  Leap Kick &#43; Knee Kick = undodged 8-point damage for 6 Guts.  Overtime for the maid.

 After Champion&#39;s Cup &#40;finished 2nd...got a lot of Phoenix Skill Cards for it&#41; I battled Isabella or something like that in the BC. I believe it was her that laid the Lock Tight card on me and I ended up winning because she ran out of cards right before me. She was a tought fight, but I did get another victory for team M.I.A. &#40;Suezo, Mocchi, and Tiger&#41;. That was an awesome card...all I could do is nip at her when I had Guts to use.

 Try comboing two or more Criticals with Golem&#39;s Cyclone after using Naga&#39;s Glare. Or Comboing Plant&#39;s Power of Sun with a Critical and three Seed Guns. Did both of those at one time or another. Nasty. And, from the card description, Gali&#39;s Flame Wall and three Criticals would end most fights in one hit.

 Try not to depend too much on total attack cards like mocchi&#39;s petal wind, gali&#39;s flame wall, or hare&#39;s gas attack.  Nelson and Totalos seem to always have a retreat card handy.  Three or four guts down the drain with nothing to show for it.  A solution to this annoying tactic is jell&#39;s riddler card.  This forces your opponent to abandon all his stocked cards and draw a new set.  Or you can try suezo&#39;s scouting card and see exactly what he/she is stockpiling.  These cards can make the difference when you&#39;re slugging it out with a total defense team.

 OK...As I have progressed through the game a bit, I find Petal Wind, Flame Wall, etc as fairly useful mainly against lower level opponents and tourneys. I tried a super Tiger combo and it&#39;s very effective against most opponents, and most monsters. Of course, if they use a block card or various others, it&#39;s not very effective. But without a doubt, If you can luckily have these 4 cards at one time: Sonic Move &#40;opponents can&#39;t dodge&#41;, Rt. Claw, Lt. Claw, and Horn. It is a move that costs 0 Guts, and does 7 in damage.

 You could also use Warp then Jell Copter which would do damage to all your opponents. Or if you hate poeple that dodge and defend alot and take away little guts forcing you to run out of cards, use close up. <BR> <BR>Adios
