 hey guys, i&#39;ve been up all night playing MRBC. i&#39;d say it&#39;s quite a nice game! kinda reminds me of Magic: The Gathering, too &#40;that was before my father burned all my cards... sniff-sniff...&#41;. but anyway, i&#39;ve come up with a new deck that took me all the way to the end of the game &#40;and in one night too!&#41;. i just felt it needed some doctoring, and i was hoping if any of you could suggest any good additions and revisions to the deck. here it it: <BR> <BR>The Withered <BR> <BR>monster cards: <BR>  pixie <BR>  horn <BR>  plant <BR> <BR>skill cards: <BR>  pixie &#40;15&#41;: <BR>    3 thunder <BR>    3 bolt <BR>    3 kiss <BR>    3 step <BR>    3 soar <BR> <BR>  suezo &#40;15&#41;: <BR>    3 spit <BR>    3 kiss <BR>    3 lick <BR>    3 back roll <BR>    3 jump <BR> <BR>  plant &#40;14&#41;: <BR>    3 toxic nectar <BR>    3 toxic pollen <BR>    3 power of sun <BR>    3 take the hit <BR>    2 leaf zero <BR> <BR>  breeder: <BR>    3 lock tight <BR>    3 busy time <BR> <BR>this is the first deck to get me past the Champion&#39;s cup &#40;even though Cue always loses the first time around&#41;. i lose most of the time to Rascal&#39;s Funky Kick deck. having only 3 lock tights, i&#39;m always forced to switch to the defensive if he plays Excited and i have no Lock tight in my hand. <BR> <BR>also, i was planning to switch that pixie for a mum mew. seems like mew moves are cool. given the pixie&#39;s dodge moves, it could work really nice, since i use the pixie only for its kiss and pretty cheap dodges. <BR> <BR>as of now, i&#39;m beat. just gone over 30 hours without sleep, but hey, i&#39;m happy. i&#39;m working on an all-golem deck with nice fight and close up, but now i really need some rest. <BR> <BR>good night, everyone! <BR> <BR>...zzz...

 If you only use Pixie for &#34;Kiss,&#34; then I RECOMMEND that you switch to a &#34;Mum Mew&#34; monster card.  The Mew breed have a technique called &#34;Miaow,&#34; which is 3 GUTS for 1 damage, and does the exact same as Pixie&#39;s &#34;Kiss&#34; skill card.  Also, Mew has some of the most diverse set of skill cards in the game, ranging everything from cheap GUTS cards to undodgables to total attack cards.   <BR> <BR>&#42;I usually always incorporate a Mew into my speed decks.&#42; <BR> <BR>Secondly, I would use the &#34;Usaba&#34; over a pure-breed &#34;Plant&#34; card.  True, the &#34;Usaba&#34; is down one life from the &#34;Plant,&#34; but it has the ability to actually DODGE an attack, whereas the &#34;Plant&#34; usually blocks &#40;Think about it, would you want to dodge Golem&#39;s &#34;CLutch&#34; or &#34;Brow Hit&#34; move, having 8 life, using &#34;Leaf Zero!?&#34; I didn&#39;t think so.&#41;. <BR> <BR>Finally, the &#34;Lock Tight&#34; card works excellent on Rascal, but he usually plays an &#34;Excited&#34; card over it.  I&#39;ve found that the computer will almost ALWAYS draw an environment card within three turns of your last ENV card played.  I would suggest a compliment of &#34;Dodge&#34; cards, and maybe, if you will continue to use &#34;Pixie,&#34; a few &#34;Recovery&#34; cards. <BR> <BR>Rascal doesn&#39;t take much to outsmart, but if oyu get touched by ANY of his monster&#39;s techniques, you&#39;ll be hurting!  Here&#39;s a swift and simplistic battle strategy for you to use. <BR> <BR>Rascal throws away his entire hand, unless he has a &#34;Defense&#34; card for his Golem, so take that into account by stocking up on DGE type cards.  With a &#34;Pixie,&#34; &#34;Horn,&#34; and &#34;Usaba,&#34; you should have a clear shot at outlasting him.  That&#39;s right, OUTLAST!  There&#39;s very little chance of K.O.ing the giants he has with a withering deck, and due to the fact that he DOES throw away his hand every turn, there&#39;s no conceivable way to keep him short for long.  If you use &#34;Provoke&#34; with Horn whenever you get a DGE card, you can force Rascal into wasting a few cards.  &#34;Enchant&#34; or any of Pixie&#39;s DGE cards will also serve you well.  Add &#34;Recovery&#34; to your Pixie&#39;s arsenal, and heal yourself if he gets in a lucky shot.  &#34;Usaba,&#34; because of its&#39; high life, should be the last target on Rascal&#39;s list, giving you time to save a few &#34;Side Roll&#34; cards up.  Don&#39;t bother attacking this guy at ALL!  You just don&#39;t have the power, once he gets his &#34;Excited&#34; into play.  However, with your &#34;Lock Tight&#34; and addition of the three &#34;Dodge&#34; cards, you should easily obtain victory. <BR> <BR>&#42;Secondary option&#42; <BR> <BR>If you are willing to replace &#34;Plant&#34; with &#34;Mew,&#34; you will have &#34;Tolerant Cat&#34; and &#34;Scaredy Cat&#34; BLK and DGE cards at your disposal, not to mention the ever-so-annoying &#34;Doll&#34; SPE card.  This will also weaken your deck against more flexible rivals, though, so I suggest only switching this one in if you battle outside of tournament.
