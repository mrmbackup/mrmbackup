 Just a few thoughts and comments on beating Stalatos: <BR> <BR>How to beat Stolatos: I find that you stand your best chance against him using a team of Speed Demons and some low cost DEF cards. I used a Tiger, Mocchi, and Suezo to beat him easily. You do not want to use any high GUTS attacks against him. You do want to take out his Plant ASAP though. He uses Toxic Nectar a lot to wither your GUTS down. Try to dodge if you have the DEF cards in your hand. If you are working on getting some GUTS, try to take only 1 card at a time and not attack. He has at least 3 cards in his deck called &#34;Busy Time&#34;, which returns all his GUTS to his stacked cards. Be patient. The way to beat him is to let him use up his cards, and have more than him. That&#39;s why you need the ENV card &#34;CONFUSION&#34; in your hand. When he gets down to less than 10 cards, and he&#39;s already played 2 of his &#34;Busy Time&#34; cards, you stand an excellent chance to beat him. What CONFUSION does, is discards the top 2 cards from the stacked deck before the draw step. BE CAREFUL NOT TO TAKE MORE THAN 1 CARD AS GUTS AT A TIME! You may run out before him. You&#39;ve got to have more cards than him when you start the CONFUSION environment! WARNING: If you are getting kinda low on cards, and haven&#39;t played CONFUSION card yet, and you have less cards than him, he has CONFUSION card too, and is not afraid to play it! The best combat against it is to pray that you have a PRAY card or two in your hand! PRAY eliminates the environment card.  <BR> <BR>This is just how I have had success beating him: By beating him at his own game. Nelson is about the same way, and Good Luck to all

 I just figured something out last night.  Cool Judge might be better than Pray for taking care of annoying env cards.  With Pray, you have to have the card in your hand before your opponent plays a Confusion or Lock Tight or Up Close.  A Cool Judge card can be played after the fact!  For one measly gut, you can get rid of any env card currently in effect.  I always wondered what this card was for, now I know!  The question I have now is, why doesn&#39;t Espada play this card on me when I use lock tight?
