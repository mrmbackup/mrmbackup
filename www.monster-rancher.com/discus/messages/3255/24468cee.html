 i am now gaining confidence &#91;at easy level&#93; my second year into the game.  at the last phoenix cup, i won all my matches.  i beat stolatos and rascal.  it looks to be a matter of time until i get the remaining monsters i need, go back in 1003 and get cue her first win, or get pabs to win out. <BR> <BR>i worry about it lasting, however.  i see advanced players&#39; recipes, and what i notice is that the decks are designed to either steamroll an opponent with attacks, or wait out an opponent with withering and defense. <BR> <BR>my current troisamies team/deck/recipe is tailored to the fact that i dont know all the opponents yet.  it tends toward the defensive side, but also features some heavy hitting worm and golem attacks if i see that is what is needed.  it has both lock tight and nice fight, again, as needed.  some battles, i dont even do damage to the other team; some battles, i knock them out. <BR> <BR>in your experience, will there come a point where i won&#39;t be able to have things both ways?  where the decks will get stronger, and i will have to commit sooner to defeat stronger play by my opponents?  or do you think a well-refined &#34;goes both ways&#34; strategy is one that can be consistently successful against the game players? <BR> <BR>if you think it would help for me to post my current recipe, i would be glad to do so.

 I think you can go both ways, although I&#39;ve gone strictly with a knockout power team. FJ seems to have a deck &#40;Plant Fire&#41; that is used strictly to wither opponents down and make them run out of cards, and has been successful with it. I tried a team similar to it before with moderate success, and now that I have a recipe from him and Eagle &#40;Romantic Flair&#41;, I am willing to venture into that realm of battle strategy again. <BR> <BR>As far as the Championship Cup, and getting Phoenix, I am in 1006 now, and I got the Phoenix card in 1003 after getting the rest of the monster cards in the plate. Every battle since then, Cue always wins her first match, and then I win. After the fight, Pabs says some crap about me being such a great champion...blah blah blah. I got one thing to say to Pabs: You gotta start pulling your load old man! Me and Cue can&#39;t do it all! In fact, I&#39;m so sick of you trying to play the role of Vince Lombardi, that I might just sit out the next Championship Cup and you can get somebody else to join your fold, cause I can tear you a new one!! Whoops..sorry! I didn&#39;t mean to get off on a rant there!

 hehehe.  i love the way they make pabs such a pathetic blowhard.  it&#39;s especially funny, given his big speech about trainers not getting lazy after raising a championship monster, blah blah blah legends cup blah blah blah.  its obvious that he accomplished exactly one thing in his career - he raised most - and has been resting on his laurels ever since.

 First of all Torey, are you asking if it&#39;s ok to &#34;go both ways?&#34;  ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Seriously though, the team that won most of my battles was named &#34;Hard Balance.&#34;  It was a Durahan, Plant, Mocchi team that, as the name implied, tried to achieve a balance between attack and defense.  The Durahan delivered raw power, the plant could wither and block, and the mocchi could peck away and dodge.  Obviously it&#39;s easier to construct a team with only one strategy in mind, but a balanced team can be much more satisfying to play with. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always wanted to build a deck that takes Nelson&#39;s strategy to the next level, and Plant Fire is it.  I&#39;m confident though that if I get bored with Plant Fire, I can always rebuild a balance team and be very successful with it.

 Yep...problem with the decks like Plant Fire is that it can get BORING!! Just taking 1 GUTS here and there can make it drag on forever.

 I&#39;m not arguing that some people will find Plant Fire too boring to use, but...  Toxic Nectar takes away three guts, Toxic pollen withers five guts, and I&#39;ve wiped out as much as twenty guts with one Fainted card.  I personally find it hilarious when someone like Vijadela says: &#34;Darn it! You run around like a chicken! You suck!&#34;  Just thinking about it makes me grin.

 There are three difficulty settings, I don&#39;t think Torey&#39;s made it to the &#34;Hard&#34; setting, yet!

 torey is on easy.  remember, the game has been out almost a month now.  a lot of people have been playing more than me.  i am still encountering opponents who are not using their best decks against me. <BR> <BR>and, to be sure, your main point is also well-taken - it is not as challenging or deep as mr2.

 For decks, I may not have played as much as the SO has, but my &#39;Weenie Poke&#39; deck seems to be very successful, thus far undefeated. Of course, this isn&#39;t saying much, when we&#39;re talking about the early fighters. ;&#41; It&#39;s your average, basic low-guts-low-damage-with-Hot-Battle deck. Not too original, but very successful, thus far.  <BR> <BR>Thomas has other decks that are more for fun than strategy, but they actually have a pretty high win ratio, so you don&#39;t need to have the high thump or the &#39;annoyance value&#39; decks. I think it&#39;s a matter of choice.

 time for a weekend update. <BR> <BR>it is november 1002.  3 months to go until the 1003 phoenix cup - the event the flying pigs, and card trainer torey luvullo, with the troisamies team/deck, have been waiting for.  2 monsters left to get now in the 2 month period - gali and dragon.  i have met all the people and been invited to all the places.  i especially like the statue in nelson&#39;s house - it looks like he hired the same designer who designed the beverly hillbillies&#39; mansion. <BR> <BR>my deck is tending toward defense, while keeping open the possibillity of the big knockout.  i have added another dodge, and golem throw away, and eliminated two little pixie attacks.  i win on ties about 3/4 of the time now.  i&#39;m glad i kept the firepower, tho, against chaille, for example. <BR> <BR>looks like i will play enough to post one more report before labor day...

 well, with a tip of the cap to suezo183, who chatted with me quite a while tonight, i fought many battles - and now have all the monsters but phoenix.  the flying pigs are very confident that now is the time to achieve our goal, and win that phoenix card!
