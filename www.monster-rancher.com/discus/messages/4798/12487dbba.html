 July, 2001.  Monster Rancher fans continued to raise stronger and stronger monsters in MR2, and rumors were flying about MR3 &#91;most of which were squelched by findings from the Japanese version of MR3...but that&#39;s another story...&#93;  Many more fansites were much more active.  One of them, Legend Cup, owned and operated by Monster Fenrick, continued to insist that MR2 ranchers should buy dexdrives, and submit their monsters to the test of MR2 computer AI tournaments.   <BR> <BR>6 trainers entered 10 monsters, and the first &#34;A level&#34; &#91;composite 72-90&#93; tournament began.  Eventually, in September 2001, Metalloid, a metalner, edged out Turn Punch, a Leaf Hare, to win the tournament. <BR> <BR>15-20 people &#34;watched&#34; the tournament in chatrooms; chats were held just to discuss the chances of the competitors.  It was an idea whose time had come.  Soon, MR2 tournaments sprang up like mushrooms after a rain.  Champions were crowned left and right.  The Legend Cup tournaments went to a 4x4 format - 4 brackets of 4 monsters each - and scrupulously kept a record of its champions, which is still available for viewing at www.legendcup.com. <BR> <BR>Fast forward to November, 2004.  MR3 and MR4 have come out.  The active tournaments are in MR4; Legendcup has been reduced to archival status only.  5 people attended the final MR2 &#34;A level&#34; tournament - a finals bracket, made up of 4 strong monsters who had won previous brackets. <BR> <BR>The favorite was sven, a centaur raised by Strunks.  Close behind, however, were Gail, a frozen gaboo trained by Red Hare, and Powerhouse, a golem from the once powerful stables of Hellraiser83.  Given scant chance was yet another leaf hare, Luffy, trained by GoGators. <BR> <BR>Therefore, Luffy&#39;s matches were fought first.  Luffy v Gail went as expected - two KO&#39;s and one decision for Gail resulted in a 3-0 sweep of poor Luffy.  But then something unexpected happened...the Powerhouse v Luffy match went to 5 rounds, with the 5th resulting in Powerhouse missing everything he tried &#91;including a self-damaging diving press&#93; and Luffy hitting on two big damage smashes.  3-2 Luffy.  then, sven won a decision in the first round of their match...followed by 3 consecutive Luffy KOs of sven - the final two on 999 heavy smashes.  3-1 Luffy. <BR> <BR>So Luffy was the leader in the clubhouse at 2 wins, 1 loss.  It was inevitable that at least one monster would tie him - but who? <BR> <BR>Gail v Powerhouse came next.  Gail went in undefeated, but came out a loser by percentages each time, 3-1.  The golem&#39;s higher damage always edged out the more frequent stings of the gaboo.  Gail began the next match with sven by landing a 999 KO on a ninja kick...only to drop the next 3, one by KO and two by decisions. <BR> <BR>Gail finished 1-2, and sven and Powerhouse were 1-1...winner of their match would earn the right to a rematch with Luffy. <BR> <BR>sven dominated the glum golem in their heads up match, winning 3-1.  the golem just kept missing too often - as golems tend to do. <BR> <BR>So the rematch was upon us.  Centaur vs Leaf Hare; Strunks vs GoGators.  Luffy won the first round by points as a result of a 632 big bang.  The second round was telling.  After a bunch of misses, Luffy landed a 1-2 punch and a smash, leaving sven in deep yellow, and with power.  However, sven made good use of his power, hitting a devastating 734 rush slash leaving Luffy down...but not out.  GRIT!  followed by a Luffy bang, to turn sven&#39;s victory into defeat.  sven KO&#39;d Luffy with two crisp techs the next round, but Luffy dominated round 4 and won the day, 3-1 <BR> <BR>All hail Luffy!  All hail GoGators!  Perhaps this piece should have been entitled &#34;Revenge of the Leaf Hare&#34;! <BR> <BR>Farewell, Legend Cup Tourneys.

 Ahem...  <BR> <BR>Anyways, this is actually pretty amazing. I don&#39;t think anyone ever predicted this. Luffy came from possibly the weakest bracket and barely winning it. Sven dominated the arguably toughest bracket, one that surpassed that of some finals. The last two were tough monsters on their own, one with a master with great skill.  <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t help but give out a long winded speech.  <BR> <BR>It was sometime in 2000, I bought this game. Pet died, and I figured I could drown all the &#39;pain&#39; away with digital guys that I had no attachment to. Well, I quickly put this game into my playstation. I raised a Mocchi. I got 200&#39;s in atleast 2 stats. I thought I was a natural. I played until my eyes couldn&#39;t take it. I won my first tournament.. The Blizzard Cup. Well, a friend of mine, Diablo, came over one time and asked if he could play. I let him, it was around this time that we discovered how to use the CDs. We put in Madden, and got a Rocky Fur.  <BR> <BR>He got it to have 500 in power. It had no skill, or anything, but it still made it to B class. I let Diablo borrow the game and he kept it for awhile. I got it back and played it scarcely. Then I didn&#39;t touch it that much. Then around January of 2003 I find the game laying around. I do a google search and found M-R.com, then I followed a link here. I read about the greats, Hellraiser, Dark Phoenix, Strunks, Velo, Lisa, Fenrick, Ryley, and so many other people. I read up on what they did and quickly raised my monsters stats.  <BR> <BR>I played non stop and got a Durahan, and maxxed it in Power. I thought it was Godly, unbeatable. Then i saw the monsters so many have routinely raised. I was in awe at the sheer strength. Then I got a dex later on, I entered the Market battle. I came in second, with Sonansu. It had many difficulties with it. It was maxxed in 3 stats and I thought it was great. I figured I had a great future, since I had accomplished that.  <BR> <BR>Well, Sonansu was a flop, and so was many other monsters I regurgatated. I had encouraged people to enter and eventually they did. I got the best to come, and they smoked me for awhile. I was jealous, my best friend made it to the finals before me. With an Undine. He was proclaiming himself the Undine and Hare master with his accomplishments in game.  <BR> <BR>Then I figured I&#39;d give one more crack at market Battles. Well, Luffy was destoryed. I didn&#39;t want to enter him in A class, but I did anyways. Figuring he&#39;d give me time to stall. Then a few other weak monsters come in and he wins, barely. Then I sighed and decided to wait for the next A class.  <BR> <BR>Well, things happened and the chance never came. A year later... Luffy is the champ. The weird thing is... He&#39;s a scrub. I had no intention of entering him. Oh well.  <BR> <BR>Good times, LC!  <BR> <BR>Oh, Strunks and Hellraiser... Thanks for everything you&#39;ve taught me. Without your help, I couldn&#39;t beat you.

 After it was 1-1, Luffy got 2 consecutive critical 999 Heavy Smashes to make it 3-1. <BR> <BR>Insanely lucky, but it happened.  Maybe if it was 5/9 I would&#39;ve won but sven has worse chances at best of 5. <BR> <BR>As long as I go down in mr2 history as one of the greats if not one of the most influential ranchers, then I am proud of what I&#39;ve done. <BR> <BR>2-1 with mepersoner, 1 loss with sandosaurus...shouldn&#39;t even count.  EAT IT
