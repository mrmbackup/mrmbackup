It&#39;s been 3 years and quite possibly the last portion of the A finals from Fenrick&#39;s <B>4x4 Monster Madness</B>&copy;.  Even if you aren&#39;t entered in this, it&#39;s still a classic tournament that anyone can enjoy.  I encourage anyone who hasn&#39;t seen a MR2 A Class Tournament or even Final, be sure to see this. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tried my best to be an entrant in every chance I could get once it was brought to everyone&#39;s attention.  And in the 4th installment, I am. <BR> <BR>Getting down to the basics: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Trainer</TD><TD>Breed</TD><TD>Odds </TD></TR><TR><TD>sven</TD><TD>Strunks</TD><TD>Celious</TD><TD>3-2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Gail</TD><TD>RedHare</TD><TD>FrozenGaboo</TD><TD>2-1 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Powerhouse</TD><TD>Hellraiser83</TD><TD>Battlerocks</TD><TD>5-2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Luffy</TD><TD>Scaled Hare</TD><TD>GoGators</TD><TD>4-1</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Of course, I have a reason for placing <B>sven</B> at the highest besides the fact that I raised him.  It&#39;s been shown that sven hits, and he hits hard.  He&#39;s the crowd favorite as well as in all lowercases.  Battling it out in the best bracket with SonOfTheSun, Vladimir, and Project Blue, sven has earned top nods.  sven edges out <B>Gail</B> by a few due to the tech array provided.  I remember quite well trying to get Ninja Kick myself, dealing with Cyclone.  I also lost with my prized Gaboo, all thanks to Cyclone.  He still has the same stat layout as sven, which doesn&#39;t bring him down completely in my prediction.  If anything, I predict that it will come down to these two Heavyweights at the end.  <B>Powerhouse</B> is a monster I&#39;m aware of completely.  I&#39;ve seen him back a year or two ago from Hellraiser, and I know he <I>can</I> hurt sven.  Problem is, 90% of the time he&#39;s getting KO&#39;d himself.  Of course, that&#39;s only sven...Gail can dish it out too, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be an even match between them.  And those techs sure are scary.  No Cyclone?  Oops, Brow Smash.  Hurts like the dickens.  Lastly, <B>Luffy</B> is the wild card of the finals.  He won in a tournament of chumps, and is playing with the champs.  It&#39;s his chance to pop a few caps, and by all means he <I>could</I> with his techs.  GG went ahead and went for a powerhouse selection.  I also heard he&#39;s KO&#39;d sven in practice sessions.  Mepersoner will say Hares rule, but then again, he&#39;s not in the finals!  Burnnnn. <BR> <BR>In conclusion, if we ever have another LC event after this, it probably won&#39;t amount to as much fun as this.  A Class, IMO, is where the most fun is at.  It&#39;s why we have had 4 so far.  Easiest to raise, most fun to watch. <BR> <BR> <BR>To those who made A class what it is, Lisa, PT, Torey, Mepersoner, Hengersrock, Hellraiser83, Infernus, Velo, Slapshotz, GG, CHB, RedHare, IJ, Newblish, Squee, Kurasu, and even Richard Ryley for destroying the competition, Tecmo style <FONT SIZE="-2">&#40;Rygar&#41;</FONT> -- It was loads of fun, and you all rock. <BR> <BR> <BR><B><FONT SIZE="+1">ALL HAIL FENRICK!</FONT></B> <BR><B><FONT SIZE="+1">ALL HAIL MONSTER RANCHER!</FONT></B>

This is tonight...ouch. I have to go to a hockey game. Anyway, I&#39;m sure sven has this. Gail and Powerhouse can hold their own, and Luffy is full of surprises, but sven is set up just right. That&#39;s not to say something might happen. Good luck to all of you!
