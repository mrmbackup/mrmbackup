Well, there were only two entries today, so the fight was best out of 9.  As a pleasant surprise, it all came down to a 9th round tie-breaker with no obvious favorite at all!  Here&#39;s an overview of the nine rounds. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Mickey vs. Schroeder</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 1:</FONT> Schroeder kicked it off with a tiger step, but it was dodged.  Mickey then replied with two reverse raids, both hitting for about 200 damage.  Schroeder got one tech in but it just wasn&#39;t enough as he lost <FONT COLOR="0077aa">58.2% to 78.8%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 2:</FONT> This time, Schroeder managed to hit his tiger steps, hitting two for about 600 damage total, then adding insult to injury with a tiger combo.  Mickey angrily retaliated with a reverse raid and a rising reave, which both hit for respectable damage, but it wasn&#39;t enough this time as he lost <FONT COLOR="0077aa">47.4% to 7.5%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 3:</FONT> This time, it was somersaults rather than tiger steps that won the round for Schroeder.  He hit three of them, doing considerable damage to Mickey who mostly sat there until making a feeble last-minute attack, losing <FONT COLOR="0077aa">78.1% to 34.7%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 4:</FONT> For the first time, Mickey hit an axes ballet, doing 304 damage, and combined with a double summer and a rising rave, tied up the two maxxed monsters in an <FONT COLOR="0077aa">87.8% to 14.7%</FONT> win for the monsters. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 5:</FONT> Schroeder beat up on Mickey while Mickey basically stood there, losing <FONT COLOR="0077aa">100% to 41.6%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 6:</FONT> Schroeder began with two somersaults totalling about 300 damage, then Mickey replied with two very strong attacks to bring Schroder down to near-half health.  However, the Tiger just didn&#39;t want to give up, and it ended the match with a 454 critical tiger step, winning <FONT COLOR="0077aa">7.2% to 24.2%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 7:</FONT> Schroeder started out pretty sadly, missing both his attacks and allowing Mickey to hit an axes ballet and a double summer.  Schroeder nearly bounced back in the end, but he lost by a margin of <FONT COLOR="0077aa">61.8% to 51.7%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 8:</FONT>  Both monsters started out missing, then both proceeded to get eachother down to near-equal health.  However, neither monster was able to change the weight of the match any further, and Mickey won <FONT COLOR="0077aa">63.7% to 53.6%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 9:</FONT>  It was the final round, the score was tied 4-4.  One monster had to walk out a winner...and that monster did so without competition.  Mickey slashed Schroeder down to 1/3 health, and Schroeder missed every single one of his attacks, giving the round and match to Mickey <FONT COLOR="0077aa">100% to 34.1%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Final: <BR>1st: Mickey 5-4 <BR>2nd: Schroeder 4-5</FONT> <BR> <BR>A great fight despite the poor monster turn out, I can&#39;t wait for the next Sub-Breed Mayor&#39;s Cup!

 Alright Mickey and Schroeder, the best Kalaragi Monsters there are! This was indeed a interesting fight of positions for a winner were bouncing back and forth. Wish DB could have been here to cheer on his tiger, and there might have been a chance of defeat, but this was indeed a close match. Great monster DB! Good Job to my one and only Maxxed Zan, Mickey!

 Had I been there i would have insisted on 5 rounds :&#41; <BR>Good job D, I&#39;ll have to plan out my monsters better in the future if I know they&#39;ll be facing you.
