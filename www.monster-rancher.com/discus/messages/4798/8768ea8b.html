 Rolaids vs. Lisaione: <BR> <BR>Round 1: Submerges went back and forth, but in the end Lisa&#39;s were more plentiful and more powerful, granting her a 54.1% to 12.5% win. <BR> <BR>Round 2: Same story as round one, but this time Lisa did more damage.  In fact, when all was done, Rolaids was only hanging on by one life point, losing 0.1% to 48.1%. <BR> <BR>Round 3: Yet again, Lisa&#39;s abundance of submerges damaged Rolaids enough to make any attacks from Fen&#39;s monster moot points in the 57.0 to 16.3 win by Lisaione. <BR> <BR>Lisaione 3, Rolaids 0 <BR> <BR>Lisaione vs. Lahas Jr.: <BR> <BR>Round 1: There weren&#39;t two many attacks here, in fact the battle was won by only two submerge attacks.  Unsurprisingly, these came from Lisa, who won 55.8 to 42.2 <BR> <BR>Round 2: This time, LJ unleashed several more attacks than he had in the previous round, and it seemed as if he was going to tie up&#91; the match.  However, through a last minute tsunami, Lisa pulled off another win. <BR> <BR>Round 3: This was a close one like round one.  Lisa began with a trademark submerge, and LJ replied with a boomerang and a powerful tsunami.  Not powerful enough however, as Lisaione was able to counter with a tail whip to win the round and the match 56.8 to 47.6 <BR> <BR>Lisaione 3, Lahas Jr. 0 <BR> <BR>Rolaids vs. Patsy: <BR> <BR>Round 1: Rolaids did moderate damage with a tail whip and a submerge, but it was all undone when Patsy let go of her killer tsunami, netting her the first KO of the night. <BR> <BR>Round 2: Patsy was even more overpowering in this round.  He did not pull off a KO, but he was never hit and Rolaids was left trembling after a 23.3 to 100 loss. <BR> <BR>Round 3: Yet again, Patsy was never hit, although this time ROlaids did better.  Didn&#39;t matter anyway, Patsy won 100 to 72. <BR> <BR>Patsy 3, Rolaids 0 <BR> <BR>Rolaids vs. Lahas Jr.: <BR> <BR>Round 1: LJ dominated, using two submerges and a tsunami to get the second KO of the night. <BR> <BR>Round 2: LJ got another tsunami, but Rolaids surprisingly came back with a flurry of submerges and show times, winning 35 to 17.5 <BR> <BR>Round 3: Rolaids, who seemed to be on an up for once in the night, managed to dodge every single attack that LJ made, winning 100 to 43.2 <BR> <BR>Round 4: Each competitor made only one move, but LJ&#39;s submerge was stronger than Rolaids&#39;, winning 73.6 to 65.1 <BR> <BR>Round 5: Submerges were flying back and forth in this exciting finale, and when the timer hit 0...Lahas was ahead by .1%, leaving Rolaids without a win for the night. <BR> <BR>Lehas Jr. 3, Rolaids 2 <BR> <BR>Lahas Jr. vs. Patsy: <BR> <BR>Round 1: Both monsters used their full array of attacks, but LJ&#39;s were twice of strong and he won 60.7% to 36.8 <BR> <BR>Round 2: Patsy used several attacks, each doing a small amount of damage, but it was enough to get ahead of Lahas.  Unfortunately for Patsy however, a boomerang and a submerge were enough to offset the difference, winning 22 to 18.6 <BR> <BR>Round 3: LJ simply beat up on Patsy in this round.  While not untouched himself, Lahas had more than enough punch to destroy Patsy 63.5 to .04 <BR> <BR>Lahas Jr. 3, Patsy 0 <BR> <BR>Lisaione vs. Patsy: <BR> <BR>Round 1: Lisa&#39;s powerful submerges won it for her again, although not without challenge from Patsy in the 45.5 to 39.2 finish. <BR> <BR>Round 2: Still more submerges from Lisa led to another win 60.1 to 42.8 <BR> <BR>Round 3: Patsy showed that he still had spirit, blocking Lisa&#39;s most powerful moves and winning by about 25% <BR> <BR>Round 4: Patsy simply performed too many successful techs for Lisa to handle, winning it and tying up the tally <BR> <BR>Round 5: Patsy dominated in this round, brutally smashing Lisa with tail whips while managing to dodge all of her techs, winning the round and match 100 to 14.1 <BR> <BR>Patsy 3, Lisaione 2 <BR> <BR>This resulted in a 3-way tie, in which Minmei was the tie-breaker. <BR> <BR>These were the three monster&#39;s percentages of health against Minmei: <BR> <BR>1st: Patsy 100% <BR>2nd: Lisa 73.3% <BR>3rd: Lahas Jr. 67.6% <BR> <BR>Patsy is the winner!  All hail Patsy and Torey!  See you at the next tournament MRM!

 i was very pleasantly surprised by patsy - i was waiting for lisa to finish her sweep when, lo and behold, patsy won...3 times!  inconceivable! <BR> <BR>btw, fen, in case you are interested, minmei&#39;s scores were lower than all the 3 participants in the tie-breaker. minmei is a worthy successor to bones, indeed!

Strangely enough, those 3 losses were Lisa&#39;s <B>only</B> losses for the whole night. Swept both Lahas and beat Minmei. But thats ok, my next &#40;or possibly next next&#41; monster will not allow for the possibility of an upset.

 I guess I am good At raising Mediators! ^_~ <BR> <BR>FYI, all Rolaids&#39; stats/chars are on Legendcup under &#34;Fen&#39;s Monsters&#34;.  Rolaids! was an accidental monster.. an experiment that got saved over at the wrong time, I am glad he did at least put up 1 fight though <BR>:&#41;

 Sounds like an interesting fight, with a few suprises in there, but non the less, NICE JOB TOREY! I won&#39;t make a monster that easy for you all next time though =P
