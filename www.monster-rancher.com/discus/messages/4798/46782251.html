<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'torey_luvullo'-!>
fenrick, lisa, and myself met today and decided how the remainder of the a class tourney will be held, and how the s class tourney will be held. <BR> <BR>A Class Tourney&#91;remainder&#93; <BR> <BR>fenrick will run a portion of the tourney &#34;offstage&#34;.  he will choose some matches, with preference being given to matches involving &#91;a&#93; contending monsters and &#91;b&#93; trainers who can be present, and set up one more &#34;fight night&#34; broadcast.  if any matches are left after fight night, they will be held offstage.  the results will be posted, and the winners will be announced. <BR> <BR>S Class Tourney <BR> <BR>The start of this tourney will occur offstage.  All matches involving monsters having the same trainer will automatically be done offstage.  The results and standings will be posted, and people will be asked &#34;what matches of those remaining would you like to see?&#34;  when we get responses, we will set up another fight night.  if any matches remain after this fight night, they will be held offstage; results posted, and the ultimate winner will be announced. <BR> <BR>THE FUTURE <BR> <BR>there will be no more round-robin 10 monster tourneys - they are too slow and cumbersome.  we will take input on what kind of match format trainers and fans want to see...here are 3 possibilities. <BR> <BR>1&#93;  smaller &#91;6 monster&#93; round robin. <BR> <BR>2&#93;  large tournament in elimination format. <BR> <BR>3&#93; 4 monster &#34;regional&#34; round robin tourneys of 4 monsters each, with the winners of each going to a 4 monster round robin championship. <BR> <BR>all input is greatly appreciated, and will be seriously considered.  however, fenrick will make the final decision.

 Actually double elimination, 8 monster tourney would be best now that I think about it.  I could find the order out from the tourneys in the real game...

 I&#39;ll suggest this even though my implication in this tournament is non existant. You should do like in the game and make tourneys round robins with 8 fighters, one battle makes a winner and a loser. <BR> <BR>Plus I really think the only rule for the monsters&#39; entry should be the NO RESET WHILE TRAINING rule. Of course it would be player honor based since nobody could verify if it was respected but would make every other rules obsolete.

there are 3 factors which haven&#39;t much been discussed yet, but which will play a major role in the decision of future format for tourneys.  they are monster availability, monster reusability and MR3. <BR> <BR><B>MONSTER AVAILABILITY</B> <BR> <BR>currently, fenrick has filled one A level bracket.  the S level has yet to fill.  a lot of people have expressed interest, but there hasn&#39;t been a lot of committments for future entries, except from the core of trainers already participating.  certainly, the amount of monsters available to work with is a very important consideration in deciding how future tourneys are to be staged. <BR> <BR><B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">MONSTER REUSABILITY</FONT></B> <BR> <BR>will the current A class be retired, or will they battle again?  i can&#39;t imagine anarchist or golden eye not wanting revenge on hyde, just for starters.  if so, then some possibilities of monster classification can be explored.  just to throw out 2 examples, you could have a setup like the english soccer leagues, where there are multiple strength levels of groupings.  after each tourney, the weakest drops a level, while the strongest moves up a level.  or you could set it up like golf, where there could be several open tourneys, and then a &#34;masters&#34; where only winners &#91;or high finishers&#93; of the opens would be allowed to enter.  &#91;we have already discussed the 4x4 round robins with winners advancing to a 4x4 championship, of course&#93; <BR> <BR>actually, with enough monsters available and reusable, there would be no need to settle in on one particular format right away - different ones could be tested to see how they work. <BR> <BR><B><FONT COLOR="119911"><FONT SIZE="+2">MR3</FONT></FONT></B> <BR> <BR>this is the 800 pund gorilla as to the whole tourney concept - in about 2 months, a lot of the people competing in these tourneys will suddenly be the owners of mr3.  if it is anywhere near as interesting as the first two, i know i will be spending a lot of my free time trying to prove myself &#34;worthy&#34; within it.  when that happens, i will be far less interested in the tourneys - at least for a while. <BR> <BR>finally, it is not my place to talk about a fourth factor - fenrick himself.  but, i will anyway^_^.  fenrick has been pounding the cyberpavement, selling this idea high and low for a year now.  in the last 2 weeks, he has gone from wondering if it ever was going to work, to a bunch of people pressuring him to hurry up and finish the tourney and start another one, already!  he is just now probably realizing what a time and work committment a successful tourney website is going to be...the shape of the future depends in a big way on how much of his time and energy he wants to spend doing this. <BR> <BR>ok - enough thoughts for one morning!

 First off it will be divided into 9 sections... there will be a time limit on when you have to have your entries in by, if there aren&#39;t enough monsters in one section &#40;4&#41; then it can be combined with another section.  It will go off main types. <BR> <BR>Section 1: Girlish Monsters <BR>Pixie, Undine, Mocchi, and Plant. <BR> <BR>Section 2: Big Brawlers <BR>Golem, Zilla, Beaclon, and Baku <BR> <BR>Section 3: Little Brawlers <BR>Hare, Hopper, Bajarl, and Kato. <BR> <BR>Section 4: Evil Monsters <BR>Dragon, Joker, Monol, and Mock. <BR> <BR>Section 5: Good Monsters <BR>Centaur, Gali, Tiger, and Phoenix. <BR> <BR>Section 6: Doll-likes <BR>Mew, Wracky, Ducken and Ghost. <BR> <BR>Section 7: All-out monsters <BR>Naga, Jill, Ape, and Gaboo. <BR> <BR>Section 8: Armored Monsters <BR>Niton, Jell, Durahan, and Arrowhead. <BR> <BR>Section 9: Robots and the Funny ones <BR>Henger, Metalner, Zuum, Suezo, Worm, and Colorpandora. <BR> <BR>Of course this is just an idea... it can be changed or not be done at all.  Now... back to the stat gains...

 That&#39;s where the idea of combining tournies that aren&#39;t filled together comes into play.  Of course a certain amount of monsters would still be needed. <BR> <BR>On another thought about the re-use of monsters... if the monster participates in A then if it has the lifespan left it can continue to be trained to participate in the next S class tourney.

 Another thought... people could vote on the matches the want to see each round.  There&#39;s four matches per round &#40;in an 8 monster tourney&#41; so people could vote to see 2 of those matches and whatever 2 they wanted to see in the next round.

 that would be good in a large tourney setting.  in a smaller one, i would rather it just be automatic - see every monster at least once in an early round, then show the crucial match-ups in the last rounds.

 follow the dex drive/interact link in the left window.  your dragon is eligible under the current format - we are talking about possible changes, but so far tourneys are open to anyone who qualifies statistically.  and you dont get to view the match, although some are &#34;webcast&#34; on fight night by fenrick - stop in the next one and check it out.

 Well, I&#39;d like to contribute two suggestions: <BR> <BR>First, it may not be necessary to go as far as five battles for each pairing to determine the winner. The strength of Round Robin is that if you have bad luck against one monster, you will likely have good luck against another. So for a Round Robin tournament I wouldn&#39;t go for &#34;best 3 out of 5&#34;, just match up each contender either once, twice, or three times against each opponent, and then the greatest number of wins takes it. &#40;And you could have the same monster fight the same monster three times and win, whereas with 2 out of three you would have stopped at the second win&#41; <BR> <BR>For Elimination tournaments, though, it&#39;s more important that you don&#39;t knock someone out because of dumb luck. How about this: Hold a Round Robin tourney, one fight for each matchup, and then the four best scorers go on to the finals, which are Elimination. This would also eliminate the problem of ties. &#40;Unless you have a tie for the fourth place slot. And then you can just hold extra Elimination rounds to break the ties&#41;

 As far as that goes, a Revenge Circuit may be an interesting concept as well, for those monsters that are out for blood and to redeem themselves, but are restricted by the class system.  Just a little idea, I know that Torey was mentioning Anarchist, GoldenEye, and Hyde.  This wouldn&#39;t even have to be a part of the actual tournament, merely a small gathering of battles to restore pride. ^_^  Seeing how this entire &#34;Fight Night&#34; thing is situated like &#34;Celebrity Deathmatch&#34; I&#39;m guessing someone already thought of this, but I decided to bring it up anyways :D

 a revenge circuit wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea, eventually.  right now, none of the 3 tourneys &#91;fenrick&#39;s, dark phoenix&#39;s or golden kaiser&#39;s mad doll tourney&#93; in existence prohibit monsters who have already fought once.  besides hyde, i notice life has entered into dp&#39;s tourney. <BR> <BR>i won&#39;t recycle monsters forever, but i expect that eventually, all of my monsters will appear in both fenrick&#39;s and dark phoenix&#39;s tourneys.
