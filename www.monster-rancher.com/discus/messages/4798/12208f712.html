Max Drives are sold separately and are also packaged with the PS2 Action Replay Max Evo. <BR> <BR>The Datel Max Drive is a flash drive &#40;like those popular &#39;thumb drives&#39; for PC&#41; for PS2. It works with PS2 saves &#40;It will not work with PSX saves, even if you play PSX games on PS2.&#41; on PS2 memory cards, and allows you to move saves from the card to your computer where you can then store, email, upload, etc. the saves. It is a small device that you plug into the PS2 USB slot, while a memory card is also in the system, move the saves to the Max Drive &#40;it hold twice as much data as a memory card&#41; then you can plug the drive into your PC&#39;s USB port and upload all your files. It is PC and Mac compatible, if you run Virtual PC on your Mac. It also works with all PS2 models. <BR> <BR>To date, the Max Drive is the most convenient way archive saves on a PC. It is very easy to use and fast. &#40;The Sharkport/X-Port often takes multiple tries to work at all, and requires that the PS2 and computer be in the same room.&#41; All you need to save onto it is the software mini-cd and the smaller-than-a-candy-bar sized drive. <BR> <BR>Detailed operating description:  <BR> <BR>You install software on your computer. On my Win98 version1 system it was very, very fast. &#40;under 30 seconds&#41; If you are using a Mac, you can install the software in Virtual PC. <BR> <BR>You stick the PS2 disc they provide into your PS2, and the drive into the PS2 USB port. You&#39;ll also need a memory card in a memory card slot. The software on PS2 reads the contents of your memory card &#40;and flash drive, but since it was new it was empty&#41; and gives you options to move saves from one device to another, delete files, or to compress them. The menus feature nice big icons and are really easy to understand. Moving files is very fast, and a LOT easier than SharkportP/X-Port.  <BR> <BR>Then you stick the drive into your PC&#39;s USB slot and open the Max Drive software. The software shows a Windows style tree menu for the Drive itself and will also look at any saves you may have previously made. &#40;when it&#39;s new, you only see their default save of a bunch of codes for cheat devices&#41; Then, to move a save form the drive, you simply click and drag it from the drive menu to the &#34;saves&#34; menu -just like using Windows Explorer. Saves pulled off memory cards, regardless of what type they originally were, are saved in a .max format.  <BR> <BR>Once files are on your computer, you can email them, upload them to websites, save on floppy disc, burn them on CD-ROM, etc.
