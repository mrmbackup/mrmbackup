<B><FONT COLOR="ff6000"><FONT SIZE="+2">DEADBUFFALO&#39;S DIVINATIONS</FONT></FONT></B> <BR> <BR>Dog Toy is by far the most polished and finished of all the monsters in this bracket. Unlike the other monsters, Dog Toy has the speed, the power, and the life to win this. 2 simple and low guts cost techs will mean many attacks that the lower life monsters will not be able to withstand for very long. Sharp Eyes and Intuitive are a nice plus too. If Dog Toy does not win this bracket, I will have to totally rethink how I raise monsters. <BR> <BR>SS-Wins! will not win, but it has 2/3 of the necessary maxed stats that i feel it needs to win, speed and power&#40;int&#41;. The tech selection is a bit peculiar, and we could see a ray field problem and overall weak attacks with a rare Ion cannon blast. But SS-Wins! real weakness is 549 life. Dog toy will have no problem showing why this is a weakness, as well as Jetli if he can get a hit in. Against Torey&#39;s Finale however, SS-Wins may be able to get away with this huge flaw. <BR> <BR>Finale also has 2 out of 3 elements that i feel are necessary to win. I think Torey chose the lesser of one however, which is why i rate SS-Wins! above. The best defense is a good offense, and thats why i like speed/power over speed/life if it comes down to having to chose between the two &#40;really, every monster should have all 3 maxed besides tanks :&#41; &#41; Finale also has what i feel to be a proven ineffective tech selection &#40;see the gitan&#39;s cup&#41;. But If any monster outperforms my divinations, then I know to always put my monopoly money on Torey&#39;s creations. <BR> <BR>Hey newcomer, Dragontrainer/Chris. I&#39;m sorry to say I agree with your prediction. However, i don&#39;t think we&#39;ve seen a tank vs reg monsters yet. Jetli only has one of the elements that I require. However, Monday&#39;s fight will prove if power is really the most important. I don&#39;t like Jetli&#39;s tech selection at all. Its a combination of weak attacks and poor accuracy attacks. But i remember my first entry&#39;s techs &#40;blair&#41;. They weren&#39;t any better. Will Jetli&#39;s superior defense and high power be able to compensate for a speed and life deficiency? We will find out on Monday night. Good luck Chris/Dragon trainer. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking forward to seeing everyone Monday night, see ya then.

<FONT COLOR="119911">MORNING LINE...MR3...CLASS A...BRACKET 2</FONT> <BR> <BR>After a short hiatus, LegendCup comes back with an interesting quartet at the lowest point level.  Here&#39;s how I see it: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Breed</TD><TD>Trainer</TD><TD>Odds </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dog Toy</TD><TD>Korodango</TD><TD>ShadowFusion</TD><TD>6-5 </TD></TR><TR><TD>SS Wins</TD><TD>Henger</TD><TD>SlapShotz</TD><TD>2-1 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Finale</TD><TD>Oltan</TD><TD>ToreyLuvullo</TD><TD>7-1 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Jet Li</TD><TD>Druger</TD><TD>DragonTrainer</TD><TD>20-1</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR><B>Dog Toy</B> is built to win, no doubt.  He will hit often and hit hard &#91;assuming the match doesnt take place in his empty range&#93;.  A deserving favorite.  If the rubber bone doesn&#39;t win, then <B>SS Wins</B> would be the logical upsetter.  He is int, which at least gnaws a little at what small weakness the Toy has, and he is a hnegar with a few decent techs, which gives him a chance to do enough damage to withstand a hit from DT. <BR> <BR>The other two cannot hang at this level, I am afraid.  <B>Finale</B> is betwixt and between, neither fish nor fowl.  Not strong enough to outpoint the top two if they land their techs, his only hope is to get very lucky.  I am afraid, at 111 spd, that <B>Jet Li</B> will need more than luck.  Salamander is there, so Jet Li might pull off an upset, but that alone is not enough, even at this level. <BR> <BR>Good luck to the monster gladiators and their valiant trainers!
