Lets see here......  <BR> <BR>SonoftheSun-I don&#39;t know much about Naga&#39;s,but I know that they can be tough and hard to beat and this one is going to be that times 10,with the Hopper fast gut regen.He&#39;ll be able to use his killer attack often which will be need in this kinda battle.  <BR> <BR>sven-Ah,the Celious.It is well raised and it even has the killer Death Smash in the second range and Stab Throw in the first.they aren&#39;t badly covered up and can be used alot with the gut regen he has.I don&#39;t like placing monsters,but he will win atleast one.  <BR> <BR>Project Blue-An odd Undine,that has Defense over Speed,but that is changed with form.She&#39;ll have plenty of defense on her side.Her attacks are somewhat lacking,they are in quanity not quality.That may be a down fall.She also has a recovery attack in the last range which &#42;could&#42; prove useful,or useless.  <BR> <BR>Vladmiir-Ape&#39;s have a good history of winning,but normall against monsters with lower defense where they couldSwing-Throw and win.He might only be able to get a one hit KO on sven or SonoftheSun,which is doubtful.He will have problems against Project Blue,but she&#39;ll have problems against other monsters.  <BR> <BR><I>I forsee a BONES breaking event</I> ;&#41;

 Death Smash?  Where?  His techs are: <BR>Short - Smash, Stab Throw <BR>Mid - Turn Stab <BR>Long - Rearleg Kick, Death Thrust <BR>Extreme - Rush Slash <BR> <BR>Anyway, no gg, he couldnt get a 1 hit KO on sven, only a golem with cyclone could 1 hit KO him &#40;Depending on guts factor&#41;  But then again, ape&#39;s have a better guts factor...oh well.  This is why I don&#39;t like the undine, hailstorm hurts and is accurate enough. <BR> <BR>So hurrah for this bracket.  4 well trained worthy monsters wanting to get to the finals.

 Any monster that has low speed generally loses to sonofthesun when i have put one up against him, although watch it be jinxed and he will lose :&#92; <BR> <BR>I do feel he will get at least 1st or 2nd, but thats my opinion and its biased, so what can i say. I hope its a good fight, and hope to see everyone there, i know i will be.

 I know a tank can beat SOTS.  No monster is clearly impossible to beat when it&#39;s a tank. <BR> <BR>Btw, newblish, why the banana method again?

 I unlike most people have patience with the game, and its always a sure way to perfect a monster, although i probably could by using items such as trorons or something else. I have many strats to use, but this works best for any ways, i can still use these monstes later on if i need peaches, gold etc. <BR> <BR>After the first banana method u get used to it, and it seems like time passes normally.

 I don&#39;t think he meant it that way MP. <BR> <BR>In any case, Vlad is the only full fledged tank in this bracket, and that will more likely hurt me than help me.  His strategy basically involves hitting with his two throw moves a whole lot, and if he can&#39;t do that he&#39;s history.

 Man, 12 years for an A-classer o_O That&#39;s like 4x the Ape&#39;s age <BR> <BR>Anyway--- <BR> <BR>1st: SOTS. Its techs are a nice combination of strong and accurate, it&#39;s from a known winner, and it has crazzzzy guts regen rates. Oh, and the fact that it&#39;s really old also swayed my decision. <BR>2nd: Eh, this is where I really have no idea. Still, I&#39;m gonna say Project Blue, because it&#39;s the only INT monster of the four. Though I don&#39;t like the form, I really can&#39;t think of a better way to do it &#40;mostly because I&#39;m lazy&#41;, and I like the nearly even combo of LIF, DEF, and SPD. <BR>3rd: Vladimir. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s named after Vlad Guerrero, which is really the only reason I think it would place better than the Centaur. It has the typical skimpy but decent tech list, and I like the tank aspect because it&#39;s not in a bracket with monsters like Golems or Durahans to exploit the low speed with killer attacks. <BR>4th: Sven. I&#39;m just not a Centaur fan, and Strunks&#39; inability to capitalize its name didn&#39;t help at all. <BR> <BR>Those are my opinions, now 99% based on opinion and not fact!

 Vlad isn&#39;t necessarily named after the baseball player, I just kinda picked a common Russian first name &#40;which happens to be held by it&#39;s current president&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, in any case, you can predict it to be 4th now ;&#41;.

 Project Blue&#39;s form benefits him alot,Toa3t.Her speed is amxxed and defense gets lowered.I&#39;m not one to know about Undine&#39;s,but I know form suites her well.

 I know what sven can do, and I know what&#39;s going to happen to sven. <BR> <BR>If I win, you have to be in the finals, MP.  One more win against you can&#39;t hurt, now can it.  Plus it&#39;d be a good dual 3 time finalist match.

<FONT COLOR="aa00aa"><FONT SIZE="+2"><CENTER>AC4B2 MORNING LINE!!!</CENTER></FONT></FONT> <BR> <BR>This is what online monster ranching is all about.  This is the most evenly matched bracket I have ever seen.  I cannot find major holes in the &#34;games&#34; of any of these monsters; this match will be decided on breed characteristics, on small differences in spd v def, and by the &#34;luck&#34; of the ai. To all entrants in this bracket:  exceedingly well done! <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Breed</TD><TD>Trainer</TD><TD>Odds </TD></TR><TR><TD>SonoftheSun</TD><TD>Time Noise</TD><TD>Newblish</TD><TD>2-1 </TD></TR><TR><TD>sven</TD><TD>Celious</TD><TD>Strunks</TD><TD>5-2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Project Blue</TD><TD>Undine</TD><TD>Diablo</TD><TD>3-1 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Vlad</TD><TD>Ape</TD><TD>Velo</TD><TD>7-2</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>We saw a sneak preview of <B>SonoftheSun</B> and <B>Project Blue</B> in Gogators&#39; exhibition match last Sunday.  I love what i saw in the Time Noise.  The other monsters in this bracket, quite simply, have a real problem on their hands in dealing with this guy&#39;s relentless attacking abilities.  The Naga&#39;s reputation as a battling breed, so long unfairly tainted by Hyde, now will grow and grow.  He may lose, but he won&#39;t lose badly. <BR> <BR>I see, from other predictions, that <B>sven</B> may be sneaking in under the radar here.  Much as I love tradition, and would love to pick Strunks last again, I have to conclude this is the best Celious I have ever seen.  Those who think he will not do damage should think again.  I particularly think that Strunks taking 50 points from int, and 50 from life and tacking them onto def may well benefit his centaur in the head 2 head matchup with the potent naga. <BR> <BR>Once again, <B>Project Blue</B> finds herself as the sole int monster against a gaggle of pow monsters.  Her speed is a little worse than the top 2, but, more importantly, she is the only monster who has a mismatched tech in this field.  She used ice sword too much in Gogators&#39; exhibition; against this field, that probably places her last.  If she avoids the temptation to use her puny sword of ice, she could finish first - this field is just that closely matched. <BR> <BR>My listing <B>Vlad</B> last is unfortunate.  This is the best &#34;last place&#34; monster I have ever seen...and, of course, my love for the Vipos-type ape moveset selection knows no bounds.  However, I do not like the choice to max lif/def by virtue of taking the spd down to 499; in a field this potent and closely match, I just have a feeling that an extra dodge is more likely to provide the razor thin margin of victory needed, than an extra &#43;40 or so in hit damage. <BR> <BR>Finally, the fact that this field is evenly matched &#91;i did point that out, didn&#39;t I?&#93; means I could be easily wrong.  This should be something to see; I look forward to seeing it.

 I thought that tanking Vlad out was a good choice.  Maaybe I was right, maybe I was wrong.  Either way, just 2 more days to find out!
