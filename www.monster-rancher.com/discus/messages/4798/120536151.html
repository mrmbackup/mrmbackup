 This might get pretty emotional, but the class everybody loves is ending. A Class will be no more and I must say i&#39;m proud that i&#39;m competeing in it. I&#39;ll break it down and get down to who I think will win. <BR> <BR>Luffy- He came from the weakest bracket and did anything, but dominate. He had too many close calls with weak monsters. Even though he is mine and the only monster i&#39;ve put in the finals I don&#39;t see him challenging anyone, except maybe Powerhouse, due to Speed. Luffy&#39;s critical Heavy Smash on sven did only around 500-700. Sven&#39;s death thrust always did enough for a KO. His fights will be brutally short, for both sides.  <BR> <BR>sven- Argueably came from the toughest bracket A Class has ever seen. He did well and beat up on the toughest competition that could each in their own win this tournament. Sven was ingeniously constructed and he is the total package. No one will touch hit and if they do they can&#39;t be that much of a threat. I could see him winning the Touranment of Leg- of wait. That might be saying alittle too much. ;&#41;  <BR> <BR>Powerhouse- He is slow and strong. When he got ahold of Luffy it always meant death. He couldn&#39;t come to grips and injury sven, then again, can anyone? He lacks the strongest attack in the game, Cyclone, but he has Anger and he can takes hit and give them out with rising guts and he can connect constantly with his high hitting techs. I see him taking, uh 2nd? I don&#39;t know how he&#39;ll fare, but he shouldn&#39;t do that bad. <BR> <BR>Gail- The final monster in this bracket, plagued with Cyclone he maybe end up shooting himself in the foot. He could probably deal out the pain to Luffy, but he couldn&#39;t take out Powerhouse or sven. I just don&#39;t see this pile of goo coming through and ripping up high defense. I don&#39;t like Gaboo&#39;s we&#39;ll see soon. <BR> <BR>This is emotion with this being the final and no matter the result if you can win and get into the finals at this calibur you have respect for me and everyone else here. You are competeing against North America&#39;s best! Good luck all!

 Looks like I have a good shot at winning. <BR> <BR>3 time finalist, gotta win this time for sure. <BR> <BR>Strunks will go down as the final champion of Legendcup&#39;s A Class Finals.

 i think sven gets to win.  powerhouse could get lucky, i suppose...gail could get real lucky...i&#39;m not sure whether luck would even help luffy... <BR> <BR>most likely, sven gets to win.

 You&#39;re forgetting the important factor of Luffy is a hare. <BR> <BR>Hares still haven&#39;t had the glory they deserve.  Go go go.

 I didn&#39;t want to say anything but I guess I&#39;ll toss in my 2 cents. <BR> <BR>Well, my love for sven and all that he is is unending. I dislike Celious&#39;, and Strunks is a creep &#40;j/k&#41;, but there&#39;s something about him...I think it may be the lower case s, or it could be, and I quote: &#34;rush s;ashj frpo,m sven!&#34;, in any case, he&#39;s cool, and has the stats to back himself up. <BR> <BR>Luffy is a stupid little green fuzzball, but he&#39;s a LUCKY stupid little green fuzzball. As much as I would like to see him fry like a chicken, I doubt it will happen. He may lose all his matches, but he&#39;ll put up a fight. His life will screw him over in the end. <BR> <BR>Powerhouse is a tank. Time and time again &#40;actually, only twice&#41;, I&#39;ve learned that tanks aren&#39;t exactly the greatest things since sliced cheese. Not only that, but as far as I can see, he has the worst guts regen of this bunch, so while his attacks will hurt if/when they hit, it won&#39;t be as often as it could be. I have nothing against slow guts monsters though... <BR> <BR>Gail...I despise it. I don&#39;t know why, but this thing just turns me off. Gaboos have a pretty good history, though, and Gail&#39;s tiger sub helps him out. Not much else to say. <BR> <BR>So, for Gail having a mismatched tech, Luffy being an odd monster &#40;with a mismatched tech&#41;, and Powerhouse being a tank, sven, who has, from what I can see, no extremely major flaws, gets to win. <BR> <BR>If I have to give an order, it&#39;ll be: <BR>sven <BR>Gail <BR>Powerhouse <BR>Luffy <BR> <BR>PH will destroy everyone if he hits enough times, though.

 I built Luffy to kill quick. Nothing is mismatched about him except that Gas and he rarely used it. If the monster can attack him, he failed.

 One stab throw can even kill him. =&#92; <BR> <BR>basically, one hitter quiter. <BR> <BR>but all non torey-istic predictions aside.. <BR>When is this taking place?

 Who knows. Fenrick needs to make the announcement. This Sunday and all of next week would be bad for me. I&#39;d kinda like to see Luffy fight. But you don&#39;t have to wait for me. =/

<I>&#34;Nothing is mismatched about him except that Gas and he rarely used it.&#34;</I> <BR> <BR>If Gas is mismatched, then something is mismatched, therefore, you can&#39;t say that nothing is mismatched. That aside, remember Carrot? Gasses and misses, it happens.
