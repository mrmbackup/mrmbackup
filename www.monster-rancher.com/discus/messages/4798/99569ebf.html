 I can do a predictions later, but for now as I think of it without too much depth.. <BR> <BR>Jabba T Hutt <BR>Sonansu <BR>Leposaurus <BR>The Hippie. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s tough for 2nd and 3rd, with the techs/types.  One has fireball but bite, one doesnt have either...one is a speedster with low defense, one is a tank that can take hits...oi.  The Mocchi can&#39;t do much damage, and that&#39;ll be a big problem.  The Gaboo will tear the competition apart, but that&#39;s not the point.  It won&#39;t give a good show.  Leposaurus and Sonansu will be a good fight.

 Actually.. i don&#39;t have bait. and I couldn&#39;t get ahold of HR83, and people already wanted the tournament on the 16th.. so I moved Bait down to the next bracket until I can get the save. &#40;or find it?&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve searched for any and all dex saves on every computer and No bait :&#40; <BR> <BR>HR83, i sincerely appologize if you see this. <BR>send Bait on over if you have him.

 Woah, it&#39;s really happening! <BR> <BR>Good luck to everyone, though Velo won&#39;t need it. Jabba is definitely the toughest monster here. I&#39;m really amazed. That&#39;s a very impressive market monster, good enough to fight just about anything.  <BR> <BR>This was my first time raising a mocchi, and my first try at the market monster, so forgive the Hippie for not being any competition for Jabba.  <BR> <BR>But don&#39;t count him out for #2. I&#39;ve been training with him, and the little guy is tough. I think he may pull out an upset on those zuums. He&#39;s got a mean tounge, and he&#39;ll have a good chance if we see a lot of it. His Mocchi ray will put a hurting on these zuums, who are definitely not scholars. And look for the Hippie to mount a furious comeback attack. He&#39;s been known to get up off the floor and launch a flurry of attacks.  <BR> <BR>Look for him to upset Sonansu, with no speed. Lepo will be tougher, but he&#39;s got a glass jaw. 2 good rays will put him on his back. He has no chance against Jabba, but who does? <BR> <BR>There&#39;s my 2G. This will be loads of fun, even if my Hippie gets crushed every time. I&#39;ve learned a lot from this already. I&#39;m hoping the Hippie will find some flower power to knock out those lizards...

 I might as well put in my two cents. <BR> <BR>Jabba T Hutt-Will win every match indefinatly nothing much to say about that.  <BR> <BR>Leposaurus-Has a good chance at 2nd place,but his attacks are a bit questionable then again his high speed MIGHT save him from a few attacks.   <BR> <BR>Sonansu-His Fireball attack was a pointless addition to his 52 int,but the 52 int won&#39;t hurt him too bad seeing as he has only one oppponent with a good int attack is The Hippie,but he does have semi-decent attacks and level 20 power and skill,but he also has 100 speed.  <BR> <BR>The Hippie-I have to agree with torey he is too balanced and doesn&#39;t have alot of &#34;umph&#34; behind his attacks but he does have a chance to beat Sonansu and maybe Leposaurus,but if he gets hit then theres really nothing that can be done for for him,but I also think that he might pull an upset.  <BR> <BR>     In a tourney where ones things certain&#40;Jabba T Hutt victory&#41;I look forward to this match.  <BR> <BR>P.S.Velo what method did you use on Jabba?

 Basically, I used the Mepersoner method, but at the end I kinda rushed it and did 3 heavy drills every month...I probably took a big lifespan hit, but he turned out pretty well.  I just wish I got ninja kick...

 I used Fenricks mixed method on Sonansu and I used lots and lots of paradoxine,but he still didn&#39;t turn out as good as Jabba...I should try mepersoners method on my next market monster.

 Wish I had more then one Paradoxine when I started... They seem to be a must for market monsters. It doesn&#39;t matter if they die young, as long as they last 4 yrs 6 months. <BR> <BR>Paradoxine &#43; Mepersoner = One Mean Monster

 Paradoxine&#39;s the best for the whole concept of 4 years, 6 months.  Kills off around 108 weeks, which will be 108 weeks of it&#39;s beginning lifespan, which includes all of the horrible baby gains, getting you closer to prime, ensuring you get the best stats before they get to 4 years, 6 months. <BR> <BR>Of course, not every market monster can be drugged this heavenly like Gaboo could.

 Recap! <BR> <BR>Well, there were a couple of good fights today...but then again...most were pretty brutal. <BR> <BR>Leposaurus vs. The Hippie:  This one went by very quickly at first.  Hippie was KO&#39;d by a single roll assault.  In the next round, four consecutive claws achieved the same goal if not at a bit of a slower pace.  Round three was a bit more interesting...The Hippie pulled out all of his stops..constantly assaulting Leposaurus with her Mocchi moves.  The thing is, they were the weaker variety of Mocchi moves, and most of them missed in any case.  Leposaurus took that match 55% to 29% for the win. <BR> <BR>Leposaurus 3, The Hippie 0 <BR> <BR> <BR>Jabba T Hutt vs. Sonasu:  If this was a fighting game, Jabba would have gotten three resounding &#34;PERFECTS.&#34;  Sonasu never landed a single tech.  Jabba hit every single one of his, leading to three KO&#39;s and a shutout victory. <BR> <BR>Jabba 3, Sonasu 0 <BR> <BR> <BR>Jabba T Hutt vs. Hippie:  Unlike the fight against Sonasu, Jabba was hit by Hippie several times.  Unfortunately for the Mocchi, the damage done by these hits ranged from 4-120...Jabba KO&#39;d the Hippie twice with ease and ended another round winning 78% to 11%, winning the match. <BR> <BR>Jabba 3, Hippie 0 <BR> <BR> <BR>Sonasu vs. The Hippie:  In what was possibly the best round of the day, The Hippie KO&#39;d Sonasu without getting hit right off of the bat.  After that however, things changed.  Sonasu utilized his basic techs of bite, claw, and tail over and over to get three KO&#39;s in a row against the Mocchi, leaving The Hipie with only one round win for the day. <BR> <BR>Sonasu 3, The Hippie 1 <BR> <BR> <BR>Leposaurus vs. Jabba T Hutt:  The first round went quickly after Lepo missed a roll assault and Jabba hit a critical 716 straight.  However, the next round would be the closest that Jabba would see for the day.  The Gaboo hit his first long punch for 279, but then proceeded to miss two straights and a chop combo.  Meanwhile. Lepo went all out with tails, claws, claw combos, and jumping claws.  After the dust settled however, Jabba still had the lead by 5%, making the match 2-0.  The final round was drawn out, with Leposaurus performing a total of six techniques.  However, he only hit two, while Jabba did a straight and a rolling chop to get his final KO of the night. <BR> <BR>Jabba 3, Leposaurus 0 <BR> <BR> <BR>SOnasu vs. Leposaurus:  This was the finale match of the night, even though it was for second place.  I myself had predicted that Lepo&#39;s ability to dodge would win him the fight, but I was mistaken.  He failed to dodge three separate powerful attacks:  a 547 roll assault, an 888 bite in power, and another 647 roll assault.  On three separate occasions, these moves KO&#39;d Hare Raiser&#39;s Zuum with little extra effort.  Lepo did get one win in middle of the match after finally managing to dodge Sonasu&#39;s powerful attacks and evgen achieving a KO with a few jumping claws.  However, in round four Sonasu connected with the previously mentioned 647 roll assault, winning him the match and second place. <BR> <BR>Sonasu 3, Leposaurus 1 <BR> <BR>So the final standings are, again: <BR> <BR>Jabba 3-0 <BR>Sonasu 2-1 <BR>Leposaurus 1-2 <BR>The Hippie 0-3 <BR> <BR>So, Jabba T Hutt will proceed to the finals, waiting for his next challenger.  Who will it be?  Make a market monster and it could be you!  Good night!

 If it helps, Blackarrow, I was yelling for your Hippie all the way. It was a beautiful, beautiful sight when he slapped around the gaboo. ;&#41; And that&#39;s from someone who _likes_ gaboos.

 Thanks for the support, Soratobu. The Hippie needed it. Reading the recap was funny. I pictured the Hippie landing all it&#39;s  best shots on the massive Gaboo, and the Gaboo just rearing back and going &#34;THWACK&#34; with a straight for 999. <BR> <BR>I could have raised the Hippie much better, like a 999 in Int. Just ended up being too balanced, and the tech chains were a pain. I&#39;ll definitely raise more Mocchis, but only for the big tourneys, so I have more time.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll definitely be in chat next time, and with a stronger market monster. This time, I&#39;m getting some Paradoxines and sticking to a monster I know well. Hope my monster can put up a better fight next time...

 Good heavens!  I forgot all about that market monster I raised!  I&#39;m sorry I missed the tourney.  I enjoyed raising a market monster combo.  It was fun.  Plus I think Spot Saurian is cute.  :&#41;
