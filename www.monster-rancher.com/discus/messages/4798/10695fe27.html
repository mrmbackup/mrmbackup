 Ok, this recap is preliminary, the full one will be posted tomorrow.  SOrry, I have tons of work to do tonight. <BR> <BR>Miso, as predicted, won, but not in a pretty way.  He had to go to a tie breaker with exzee in which he won through the fact that ex&#39;s tech choice was bad at the time.  ALl in all, not the best tourney ever, but more on that tomorrow. <BR> <BR>Miso is tonight&#39;s winner at 2-1 <BR>Exzee 2-1 <BR>Kabal 1-2 <BR>Rimowa 1-2

Now for the REAL recap. <BR> <BR>To say it in a nice way, this tourney was on the uneventful side, but it had it&#39;s moments.  It almost seemed as if Torey&#39;s simple prediction of &#34;MISO GETS TO WIN&#34; was inevitable, considering the stats of the other monsters entered.  Maybe it was, maybe it wasn&#39;t...you&#39;ll have to read to find out! <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Rimowa</FONT> vs <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Kabal</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 1</FONT>:  Rimowa and Kabal: the two tanks of this tournament.  That&#39;s the breaks with monsters such as these, you need to have both power and intelligence with these tech selections, and thus speed usually is the stat to pay for it.  Regardless, it meant that this match would be decided by pure offensive prowess and speed.  I was tardy to this tournament and missed this very first round.  However, I was informed that it consisted of two techs each, Rimowa&#39;s being s little more powerful to win <FONT COLOR="0077aa">46% to 42%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 2</FONT>:  Rimowa kicked this one off with two 250 damage techniques to bring the mighty crab dragon down to below half health.  It was responded to by a single flutters, much less than enough to make this round a contest.  Rimowa wins <FONT COLOR="0077aa">75% to 44%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 3</FONT>:  In this very close match, Kabal used some of his lesser techs followed by a devastating trample to bring Rimowa to less than a third of health.  However, the noble jell struck back with some heavy stuff of his own.  When the dust finally settled, however, Kabal was victorious <FONT COLOR="0077aa">35% to 32%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 4</FONT>:  This match was very much like round three, though this time Kabal actually did some dodging to increase his lead over, though not by much as he tied it all up 2-2 with a <FONT COLOR="0077aa">55% to 47%</FONT> victory. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 5</FONT>:  Using a dragon punch, a fire bretah, a flutter, and a slamming down, the dragon finally proved that he was as powerful as he looked, devastating Rimowa&#39;s chances for a win despite the fact that he hit with a Jell COpter.  Sorry buddy, but numbers don&#39;t lie: <FONT COLOR="0077aa">57% to 9%</FONT>.   <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>:  Kabal 3-2 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Exzee</FONT> vs <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Miso</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 1</FONT>:  In the battle between the speeders, it was all about accuracy.  Miso had an advantage in defense however, which served him well in the coming fights.  Round 1 saw some moderate attacks from Ex while Miso replied with three super zuum techniques totalling for over 1000 damage and, therefore, a <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 2</FONT>:  Lots of misses here...lots.  Three techs total hit, and even though two of them were fromExzee, they did not total up to beat out Miso&#39;s single jumping claw.  The Crab Saurian won <FONT COLOR="0077aa">84% to 82%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 3</FONT>:  Ex broke out this time, with 1-2 blows left and right mixed with three flicks.  It was enough to make Miso spend more time using GUARD then doing anything else, he lost it <FONT COLOR="0077aa">29% to 45%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 4</FONT>:  Just like the last round, Ex was just plain too aggressive to be taken down by Miso, winning once again by percentage, <FONT COLOR="0077aa">75% to 35%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 5</FONT>:  Miso did not want to end up like RImowa.  Dodging almost every one of Exzee&#39;s attacks, Miso then let loose with a 639 burning roll that sealed the deal for him.  He coasted to an easy <FONT COLOR="0077aa">94% to 15%</FONT> win. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Miso 3-2 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Exzee</FONT> vs <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Rimowa</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 1</FONT>:  With an advantage in speed, it seemd to me that Exzee had this one in the bag, but Rimowa did not make it easy for him.  He kicked things off impressively with a 699 jell copter, from which never recovered.  The noble Jell took it <FONT COLOR="0077aa">94 to 27</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 2</FONT>:  In a total turn around from the last battle, Exzee started acting like his stats suggested he could, dodging every single one of Rimowa&#39;s attacks and dishing out quite a bit himself.  Easy win, <FONT COLOR="0077aa">100% to 17%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 3</FONT>:  This is one of those rounds from which you just want to move on.  While RImowa did nearly nothing, Exzee did four lightning attacks...in a row.  As you may know, from a m,onster such as this, lightning does low LOW damage.  Still, it was enough for a sad <FONT COLOR="0077aa">79% to 73%</FONT> win for Exzee. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 4</FONT>:  This was better.  Like in the first round, RImowa was impressive with a 704 Jell Copter.  Too bad that&#39;s all he did.  I thought Ex would never recoverfrom it, but he did with five consecutive hit attacks, edging himself out in front of RImowa, winning <FONT COLOR="0077aa">27% to 25%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Exzee 3-1 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Rimowa</FONT> vs <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Miso</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 1</FONT>:  Once again, it was Rimowa vs. a guy with speed, but maybe this one would turn out differently.  The first round went as expected, RImowa couldn&#39;t hit his beam gun attack, allowing Miso to take it by a small <FONT COLOR="0077aa">46% to 36%</FONT> margin. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 2</FONT>:  999 beam cannon from Rimowa!  &#39;Nuff said, <FONT COLOR="ff0000">K to the O</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 3</FONT>:  This time it was Miso&#39;s turn to rip it up.  After some laughable Jell techs, the Zuum replied with a 609 roll <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> and a 287 diving claw for a not so instant but still decisive <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 4</FONT>:  Miso would have secured himself the win here if he didn&#39;t waste his guts on a 5 balls attack.  Well, he did, and it did 18 damage, allowing Rimowa to tie it all up <FONT COLOR="0077aa">65% to 39%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 5</FONT>:  After an impressive array of Zuum techs to bring Rim to 1/3 health, it all looked over for the poor guy.  But as fate would have it, he was able to respond enough to make Miso&#39;s health half as muh as his own measly number.  It stayed this way, thus giving Rimowa the win <FONT COLOR="0077aa">33% to 14%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Rimowa 3-2 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Exzee</FONT> vs <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Kabal</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 1</FONT>:  Facing off against another tank, Exzee was hungry for his chance to go to a tie-breaker with Miso.  in fact, he was so hungry that he dodged ALL of Kabals attacks, coasting to a <FONT COLOR="0077aa">100% to 59%</FONT> victory. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 2</FONT>:  Once again, Kabal just couldn&#39;t hit what he needed to, while exzee unloaded with flicks and jabs to get a <FONT COLOR="0077aa">percentage win</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 3</FONT>:  Kabal had had enough.  After a 545 flying combo and a 253 critical wing attack, Exzee looked done for this round.  Not so said the funky Hopper. He came right back with a whole lot of flicks and jabs, followed up by a 447 hopper combo to win it <FONT COLOR="0077aa">19% to 15%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Exzee 3-0 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Kabal</FONT> vs <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Miso</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 1</FONT>:  This was it.  The winner of this would be meeting up with Exzee in the tie-breaking round.  It was the same old story, a speedster versus a tank, and this time, the results were a bit more predictable.  Just, not in the first round.  Kabal actually dodged Miso&#39;s powerful Zuum attacks while managing to land a flutter and a claw combo to win by an <FONT COLOR="0077aa">81% to 4%</FONT> advantage. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 2</FONT>:  Kabal used one slamming down, and missed.  ZUum hit with several attacks.  No more explanation needed in this one, Miso wins <FONT COLOR="0077aa">100% to 5%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 3</FONT>:  Kabal ACUALLY managed to hit with a 2 bites here...for 144.  Meanwhille, a fire charge, two tail combos, and a diving claw were enough to effectively <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT> the Crab Dragon. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 4</FONT>:  Kabal hit a claw combo.  Weeee.  Miso did a lot more as usual in the last rounds of this match, getting an easy victory thanks to his speed and good tech choice <FONT COLOR="0077aa">57% to 14%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Miso 3-1 <BR> <BR> <BR>THE TIE BREAKER!!! <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Exzee</FONT> vs <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Miso</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 1</FONT>:  Ah yes, the tie breaker.  As expected it was the two speeders of this bracket who would face off for the last time.  I myself couldn&#39;t have predicted this victory surely.  Round 1 saw Exzee taking advantage of his quickness through a flurry of moderately powerful hopper techs that outweighed some of Miso&#39;s less powerful Zuum techs, winning it <FONT COLOR="0077aa">42% to 13%</FONT> for him. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 2</FONT>:  Exzee was far less impressive this time, he only did two techs then watched as Miso put his best claw forward with FOURjumping claws in a row, for an easy <FONT COLOR="0077aa">percentage</FONT> win. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 3</FONT>:  Here, poor exzee missed just about everything while Miso hit with a jumping claw and two normal claws, totalling up to an <FONT COLOR="0077aa">89% to 53%</FONT> win for the Crab Saurian. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Round 4</FONT>:  I felt kind of bad for Ex by now.  He had taken a beating and was not dishing it back out at all.  This did not change in round four, he was smited soundly  by a claw combo and a jumping claw while he was only able to hit one flick himself.  He lost <FONT COLOR="0077aa">90% to 12%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Miso 3-1 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">THE FINAL STANDINGS</FONT>: <BR> <BR>Miso: 2-1 &#40;winner&#41; <BR>Exzee: 2-1 <BR>Kabal: 1-2 <BR>Rimowa: 1-2 <BR> <BR>There you have it.  Miso moves on to the S CLass finals.  Thanks to Fenrick for hosting yet another tournemnt, it&#39;s a lot of work, especially with one this long!  All hail Kimochi and Miso!

 Actually Rimowa was winning Kabal 2-0 and allowed him to comeback for a 3-2 win. <BR>If Rimowa had won one more round defeated Kabal it would have been a 3way tie. ;-&#41;

 Is this Kato the one from your fan fic? <BR>BTW, If that Rimowa was the one from your fanfic he should be worst instead of best, would fit more the character. ;-&#41;

 Oh wow!!! <BR>I really didn&#39;t have any expectation for Miso in this tourney.  The truth is, I just got the DexDrive from Fen, and decided to put up a monster I had at the time to test out the DD&#39;s saves.  I&#39;m happy about the outcome, nevertheless.  Thanks to Velo for the recap.  I promise my next monster will perform its best to entertain you all.
