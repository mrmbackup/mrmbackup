<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
&#42;Infinite Jokers couldn&#39;t find time in his busy schedule to host this tourney LIKE HE SAID HE WOULD, but luckily Hellraiser was there to take on the responsibility and once again he did a fantastic job&#42; <BR> <BR>This tournament was great, and the excitement really grew as the tournament progressed. Excellently announced by Hellraiser, and made intense by the jabs and jeers of a good 10 person crowd as well as the monsters themselves, Tank War Volume Two&copy; was a tourney not to be missed. <BR> <BR>Four monsters battled it out in a round robin format, the tournament took 3 rounds, 2 matches per round, here is my recap.  <BR> <BR><B>ROUND 1</B> <BR>  <BR>Omni Snake vs. Blade Started off the tournament. Blade began things with a Rolling Slash, but ANGER &#40;the first of many cases&#41; proved to be on Omni Snake&#39;s side, and it led him to a KO victory. Anger switched in Blade&#39;s favour, but it wasn&#39;t enough, and OS once KO&#39;ed Blade. OS finished Blade quickly in the third match with a Turn Assault, and two Drill Attacks. The Victor: Omni Snake 3/0, all by KO <BR> <BR>Blade vs. Mace Windu was a battle of the Durahans, but in round one Mace prevailed with a Ko-ing Rush Slash. The next match didn&#39;t change much, Blade became angered and launched a feeble Million Stabs, but Mace decided to bring out the big guns and unleash a 483 damaging DeathBringer KO.  <BR>The Victor: Mace Windu 3/0, all by KO <BR> <BR><B>ROUND 2</B> <BR> <BR>Blade vs. Top Seed was the first match in round 2, and a very exciting one at that. TS Flutter Slapped his way to a sharp damaging Missile KO, and followed to <B>DODGE</B> Blade&#39;s Rolling Slash. In addition, the hyperactive Ducken skipped his Ritalin deciding to go Bombing and Ko Blade once more instead. The 3rd, and final match showed us a second bombing from TS, and gave insight to Blade&#39;s emotional side. Anger flared up twice for Blade in the final match, but With a 627 damaging Big Missile KO Top Seed showed him who was boss.  <BR>The Victor: Top Seed 3/0, all by KO <BR> <BR>Omni Snake vs. Mace Windu proved that lightning can strike not only <B>twice</B> in the same location, but an amazing <B>three</B> times! First match was Mace by a 3 lightning KO win. In the following match, OS evened the score with an angered Stab and Pierce, as well as 2 thwacks. Mace brought up his Guard, and launched a would-be devastating DeathBringer if it weren&#39;t for Guard. A puny 224 damage to OS, and 21 damage to himself. OS decided to use his stockpile of 90 Guts, and KO&#39;ed Mace with a Drill Attack in the last second. Three Drill Attacks and a Turn Assault brought OS another KO victory, but Mace used a powered up Lightning KO to tie with OS. The <B>only</B> match to go to 5 matches, the 5th was the end of the road, and unfortunately Mace just didn&#39;t have what it took. An angered Turn Assault KO left Mace in need of medical attention, as the Jungler walked proudly away. <BR>The Victor: Omni Snake 3/2, all wins by KO <BR> <BR><B>ROUND 3</B>  <BR> <BR>Mace Windu and Top Seed battled it out here, and TS unleashed not 2, not 3, but <B>4</B> Ducken Dances plus a Surprise. And just when you thought it was getting boring, TS finished the match with an Explosion KO. TS continued on his winning streak in the second match, as the two ate away at eachothere piece for piece, until TS had only 37 lif, and Mace had 15. A 76 damaging Surprise more than did the job and if was TS 2/0. Mace Rush Slashed TS twice right away, doing a total of 183 damage to TS. A double Bombing and 2 Flutter Slaps from TS were not enough though, and with a final Thunderbolt, Mace won the match. As Mace continued his Lightning streak, TS worked on his projectile skills and KO&#39;ed Mace with two Missiles. <BR>The Victor: Top Seed, 3/1, all wins by KO <BR> <BR>The Final Battle: <BR> <BR>Omni Snake vs. Top Seed. This was an intense match, and TS started it out the right way with an Explosion. OS flared up in anger, then clamed down, to get attacked by a Ko-ing Big Missile. Next match Continued in the same fashion and TS coughed up another Big Missile, as well as 2 regular missiles, Ko-ing OS once more. 3rd match TS kept up his pace and shot missiles galore at OS, who responded with Thwacks and a Turn Assault. With one second remaining on the clock, and TS flashing yellow , the Watermelony had the will to win and launched a 999 sharp damaging Big Missile KO at OS.  <BR>The Victor: Top Seed, 3/0, all wins by KO  <BR> <BR><B>The Winner of The Tank War: Volume Two&copy; is Top Seed by Lisa Shock</B>. All the monsters fought well tonight, but only the hyperactive Watermelony will continue on to the finals. <BR> <BR>The only dodge in the entire battle was in  Round 2, Blade vs. Top Seed, and all fights were won by Ko, yes, every time.

 ....I must say that Lisa cannot win the finals.  It&#39;s against the laws of nature, and the universe will once again implode on itself if she is to continue....
