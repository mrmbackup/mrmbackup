 Hi, this is Mewger, or ScytheGirl, as I&#39;m known by in the chat. I was lucky enough to be given a job as a recorder, and I&#39;m going to give you the recap of the Easter Tourney. This is my first recap, so forgive me if it&#39;s bad. I also don&#39;t have mr3, so I don&#39;t know what the attacks do. There won&#39;t be much attack detail. This was a long tourney, so this will be a long recap. Don&#39;t bother reading it all if you don&#39;t want to, the standings are at the bottom, just go there if you like. &#39;Cause you just want to know who won, don&#39;t you? Well, here goes: <BR> <BR>The first fight was Engin vs Harmless, who is anything but... <BR> <BR>Round One-  <BR>It started out with a Spin Bang from Harmless, but it was dodged. Answering with a Spin Bang of it&#39;s own, Engin hit for 107 damage. It continued it&#39;s attack with a Bullet Head, doing 115 damage and knocking Harmless dizzy. Harmless recovered quickly though, using it&#39;s own Bullet HEad attack for 125 damage. Engin attempted another Spin Bang, but it was dodged. Harmless used it&#39;s own Spin Bang, doing a mere 99 damage, but immediately made up for that with a 187 damaging critical Bullet Head for a KO. Harmless wins the first fight. <BR> <BR>Round Two-  <BR>This round started with an Uncho from Engin, which Harmless avoided. Next up was a Bullet Head from Harmless, which did 135 damage with some payback, knocking Engin dizzy. It next used the same attack another time, for 115 damage. Engin used a Bullet Head, which was blocked. Harmless was having better luck, and better timing- it hit with a Bullet Head attack at the last second for a 122 damaging KO. Harmless wins the second round. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>As if trying to make up for it&#39;s two early KO&#39;s Engin started this one off with a Bullet Head attack. It was blocked, and answered with a Spin Bang from Harmless. It criticaled for 123 damage. Engin used it&#39;s own Spin Bang, but it missed. Harmless also attempted the same attack, and it missed as well. It made up for it with another of the same, this Spin Bang hitting for 107 damage. Continuing the trend, Engin used Spin Bang, but it was blocked. The Spin Bang fad didn&#39;t fade in this match, the last move of the fight was a 117 damaging Spin Bang from Harmless, for a KO. Harmless wins the third round as well. <BR> <BR>Engin 0, Harmless 3 <BR> <BR>Engin vs. Satan666 <BR> <BR>Round One- <BR>This started with an 83 damaging Uncho by Engin. It then used a Spin Bang, which missed. Satan666 used a Bow attack, which did a puny 20 damage. It made up for it with a Random Hit, for 113 damage. Engin then used a Spin Bang, which did- 113 damage! Same as the previous attack. Satan666 used it&#39;s Bow attack again, for 28 damage, and then attempted another Random Hit at 3 seconds left! But it Randomly Missed, and Engin took the first round. <BR> <BR>Round Two- <BR>A Bullet Head attack from Engin started the second round, which was blocked. Satan666 used an Ab Boomerang attack, for 48 damage. It follwoed up with a Bow, which missed, and Engin then used an Uncho, which was dodged as well. Satan666 wasn&#39;t giving up on Bow, it used it again, for 23 damage. Engin used it&#39;s Spin Bang for the first time in the match, for 86 damage. Satan666 used an Ab Boomerang, which did a critical 56 damage, but it couldn&#39;t save it. Engin used an Uncho for 82 damage, and took the first round, 57.1/44.7. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>Satan666 was not giving up. It opened with Bow, for 19 damage, and then used it again, for 20. Engin used Spin Bang, for 102, and another, which missed. Satan666 used Ab Boomerang, which didn&#39;t hit, and then used Bow again. Engin tried another Spin Bang, but this match was all the devious Dakkung. It&#39;s Spin Bang missed, and Satan666 answered it with a 21 damage Bow and a 111 damaging Random hit. It tried the Random Hit again, but it again, Randomly Missed. It didn&#39;t matter though, because Satan666 had this battle, 36.5/66.4. <BR> <BR>Round Four- <BR>Engin, shaken from the loss, starts off a crazy missing spree from both sides. It started with Spin Bang, and Satan666, used Bow. Neither hit, but Satan666 wasn&#39;t stopping. It followed with three Ab Boomerangs in a row- which ALL missed. That didn&#39;t teach it anything, though, because it used another attack, Bow, which didn&#39;t hit either. A good part of the fight had gone by, and no one had landed any techs. As if it was supposed to solve this problem, Engin used a Bullet Head, which not only hit but criticaled, for 222 damage. Satan666 only had one option left open to it if it wanted to dream of winning, so it used its best attack, the Random Hit. But it &#40;you guessed it&#41; Randomly Missed. And Engin won it, 94.6/26.9. <BR> <BR>Engin 3, Satan666 1 <BR> <BR>Engin vs. Snowdrop <BR> <BR>Round One- <BR>Snowdrop, the most different &#40;and cutest&#41; of the hare trio, started this battle off with a Mini Punch. Which did 6 damage. Everyone thought it was a typo, but it wasn&#39;t. It then used a Surprise attack for 22 damage, and another for 23. Engin used a Spin Bang, but it didn&#39;t hit the quick Snowdrop. Snowdrop used Muhha for 29 damage, and another one for 20. That was the end of the match, and Snowdrop won, 66.7/100. <BR> <BR>Round Two- <BR>Snowdrop decided to stick with what worked and attack first, with a Surprise attack. It was blocked, and Engin then founf it&#39;s opportunity for revenge. It attacked with a critical Bullet Head, for 187 damage, leaving Snowdrop with 8 life. It tried to get back in it with a blocked Surprise and an 1 damage Min Punch, but it was no use. Engin wanted a KO, but it&#39;s Spin Bang missed it&#39;s chance. Snowdrop tried a Mini Punch for 6 damage, and Engin tried a Bullet Head. It was blocked, and so was the Surprise that followed it. Engin won that fight, but you have to give Snowdrop some credit for not getting KO&#39;d. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>Engin started with a Spin Bang, and it missed. Snowdrop used it&#39;s Muhha for 35, and a Mini Punch, which didn&#39;t connect. This lead to two more misses form the adorable easter bunny, one missed Muhha and another missed Surprise. Engin used Spin Bang, which was dodged, and Snowdrop used another Surprise, for 17 damage. Engin shrugged that off easily, to attack with a Spin Bang for 137 damage. Snowdrop got in one last Muhha before the end, for 23 damage, but it wasn&#39;t anywhere near enough. Engin won, 73.7/29.7.  <BR> <BR>Round Four-  <BR>Engin used a Bullet Head, which was nicely blocked. Snowdrop used a Muhha, which was also nicely blocked. But it kept at it and landed another Muhha for 30 damage. It then used the Mighty Mini Punch- for 2 damage. Engin decided to show it what an attack really was, and used a Spin Bang for 106 damage. Snowdrop obviously didn&#39;t care about what it thought, and used another Mini Punch for 8 damage, and a Surprise, which was dodged. The end, you all know, was Engin winning it, 86.7/45.6.  <BR> <BR>Engin 3, Snowdrop 1 <BR> <BR>Engin vs Homsar <BR> <BR>Round One-  <BR>Engin opened up with an Uncho, by far it&#39;s least used attack. It was dodged, and dodged again for the first two attacks of the fight. Homsar used a Mocchi Spray for a nice 81 damage, and then a Tongue Lick for 8 damage- but 25 gutsdown. After that, it used Monta for 9 damage, and another Tounge Lick for about the same damage and gutsdown as before. Engin used a Bullet Head, but it missed and allowed Homsar to win, not having hit it at all. <BR> <BR>Round Two- <BR>This was a short one, Homsar starts with a Tounge Lick and then uses Mocchi Spray for 66 damage. It used it again for 51, and didn&#39;t get to do any more. Engin used it&#39;s Spin Bang for 142 damage, and an Uncho for the KO. Win goes to Engin. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>Homsar used a Mocchi Spray for 66 damage, and Engin used an Uncho. That attack missed, along with the responding Monta that followed it. Homsar landed a Tounge Lick, and Engin used its great Bullet Head attack for 167 damage. It seemed like the match was going to decision, but at 6 seconds left, Engin used an 81 damaging Uncho for a KO, giving it the third round.  <BR> <BR>Round Four-  <BR>This was another short one, Homsar using an Tounge Lick, and Engin using a Spin Bang. Homsar used a Monta, and Engin used a Bulled Head, for 214 damage, a KO. Engin took this fight, no problem. <BR> <BR>Engin 3, Homsar 1 <BR> <BR>Engin vs. GOD? <BR> <BR>Round One- <BR>Round One of this fight started with GOD?&#39;s Ab Boomerang. It hit, for 34 damage, and a second one hit for 36. Engin tried Bullet Head, which was blocked. GOD? used Three Piece, but it was blocked too. Engin then used it&#39;s successful Spin Bang, for 109 damage, and then another blocked Bullet Head. GOD? used a critical Ab Boomerang for 70 damage, and then dodged a Spin Bang to win. <BR> <BR>Round Two- <BR>GOD? started it up with a Three Piece, which was blocked. Engin then used it&#39;s Spin Bang for 134. GOD? used Ab Boomerang for 33 damage, and another for 30. Engin used Spin Bang again, for 137, and then it dodged two Ab Boomerangs. It finished the round with Bullet Head, KO&#39;ing the divine duck. Engin wins the second round. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>Engin used Spin Bang to start with 166 damage. GOD? retaliated with Ab Boomerang for 39 damage. It then launched into a Three Piece attack for 59 damage. Engin used a Spin Bang after that, for 126, and GOD? used another Three Piece for 64. One of the few dodges of this fight, was when Engin missed a Spin Bang. After that, it was hit with an Ab Boomerang for 34, and missed another Spin Bang. Engin still won the fight, though, defeating the duck. <BR> <BR>Engin 3, GOD? 0 <BR> <BR>Engin finished up it&#39;s fights then, and it was time for the next hare to battle... <BR> <BR>Hamrless vs. Satan666 <BR> <BR>Round One-  <BR>Satan666 started with an Ab Boomerang attack for 32, and Not-So-Harmless countered with a 144-damaging Bullet Head. Satan666 used a Random Hit that actually hit, for 90 damage. Harmless followed that with a 96 damage Bullet Head, and that meant trouble. Satan666 scrambled to get back in it, with three Ab Boomerangs in a row. Two hit, one for 36 and the other for 25, but that wasn&#39;t any use. Harmless smacked the duck with a Bullet Head at the last second, doing 147 damage and getting a KO. <BR> <BR>Round Two- <BR>Satan666 started by Randomly Missing, and Harmless hit with a Spin Bang for 111 damage. Satan666 used an Ab Boomerang, which also missed, and Harmless used another devastating Spin Bang, this time for 110 damage. Satan666 just couldn&#39;t land an attack this match, it missed a Bow and lost after Harmless hit it with a 102 Spin Bang, KO&#39;ing it. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>Much like Round Two, Satan666 started by Randomly Missing. It then tried an Ab Boomerang, which was also dodged, and Harmless landed a critical Spin Bang for 189. Satan666 tried another Ab Boomerang, and hit for 27 damage, but was then KO&#39;d by Harmless&#39;s Bullet Head for 160. <BR> <BR>Harmless 3, Satan666 0 <BR> <BR>Harmless vs. Snowdrop <BR> <BR>Round One- <BR>Round One was very short. I won&#39;t talk long. 182 Spin Bang by Harmless, a dodged Mini Punch by Snowdrop, and a 129 Spin Bang from Harmless ended this one in a quick KO. <BR> <BR>Round Two-  <BR>Round Two was a bit different, starting with a blocked Muhha from Snowdrop. It then used a Mini Punch, for 4 damage. Harmless used its Spin Bang for 147, and Snowdrop used its Mini Punch for nothing, since it missed. Harmless then just used Spin Bang for another KO. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>This was quite an upset. Snowdrop started things off by using Surprise, which was blocked. It tried again, and was blocked again, and Harmless chose then as the time to try another Spin Bang. It missed it, and its next Bullet Head was blocked. It desperately tried to get in another Spin Bang, but it missed that too, and Snowdrop started Mini Punching. The missing must have been contaigous, because it missed two, but then finally hit with the third one, for 1 damage. It then used Surprise for 20 and won it, 93/100, dodging or blocking every attack thrown at it. &#40;Go easter bunny!&#41; <BR> <BR>Round Four-  <BR>The celebrating stopped, because this was like a flashback to the past. Snowdrop started with a blocked Surprise, and got hit with a 187 damaging Bullet Head, leaving it with &#40;you got it&#41; 8 life. It missed a Mini Punch, and another, and got a Muhha blocked. It wasn&#39;t giving up though, trying again with the Mini Punching. It missed one, but hit with one, for an improvement of 4 damage. Harmless didn&#39;t do much of anything this round, but what it did do was enough and it won, 92.3/4.1. <BR> <BR>Harmless 3, Snowdrop 1 <BR> <BR>Harmless vs. Homsar &#40;I wanted the Isobe to win, it was unique...&#41; <BR> <BR>Round One-  <BR>Harmless opened the match with a Sping Bang for 118, and another for 101. Homsar answered with a Monta for 14 damage, and a Tounge Lick for 8 and around 20 gutsdown. It used it again, this time for 9 damage, and yet again, for 8 as usual. Harmless wanted a KO, however, and it got one, with a last-second Bullet Head for 140 damage. <BR> <BR>Round Two- <BR>This was a short round. Homsar used Tounge Lick, and Harmless used Bullet Head for 159 damage. It then blocked another Tounge Lick. Homsar hit with the next one, but Harmless just Bullet Headed it. 136 damage, KO. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>Homsar used two Tounge Licks and a Mocchi Spray for 64 damage. Harmless used Spin Bang for 131 damage, and Homsar used a 11-damaging Monta. It did a good job of blocking a Bullet Head, and it hit Harmless with another Tounge Lick and a Monta. Didn&#39;t matter though, Homsar still lost, 61.7/44.7. Harmless wins this, 3-0. <BR> <BR>Harmless 3, Homsar 0 <BR> <BR>Harmless vs. GOD? <BR> <BR>Round One-  <BR>GOD? started with a Three Piece, which was blocked. Harmless then missed a Spin Bang, but hit with another one for 110. GOD? wasn&#39;t having much luck with Three Pieces, the second one was blocked, but it also blocked a Bullet Head. Harmless just answered with another Spin Bang, for 94 damage, and was hit with a Ab Boomerang for 42. Harmless still won the match, 86.0/33.1. <BR> <BR>Round Two- <BR>GOD? tapped into it&#39;s divine duck powers and landed a critical Three Piece. It then hit with an Ab Boomerang, and dodged a Spin Bang. It&#39;s power faded after that though, it missed an Ab Boomerang and while it hit with one more for 29 damage, it was hit with a Bullet Head for 190. It landed two more Ab Boomerangs, one a critical for 41 damage, but then it was hit with a powerful Bullet Head for a 189-damage KO. Harmless won this round. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>Harmless connected with a Bullet Head for 142, dodged an Ab Boomerang, and blocked a Three Piece to start things off. It tapped a little too much of it&#39;s luck though, it missed it&#39;s next Spin Bang, and got hit with two Ab Boomerangs, for around 30 damage each. It then just decided to win it, landing a Spin Bang for 124 damage.  <BR> <BR>Harmless did a great job, a few defeats, but not much, and it was guaranteed to win the tourney. But without the super hare-pair in the battles anymore, things got interesting... <BR> <BR>Satan666 vs. Snowdrop <BR> <BR>Round One-  <BR>Snowdrop started with Surprise, and it criticaled! For 38 damage... Satan666 used a Random Hit for 125, and that was the only move needed. Snowdrop made some little scratches in the evil Dakkung with 3 consecutive Surprises, but it didn&#39;t matter. Satan666 won, 60.8/35.87. <BR> <BR>Around here my Mom called me to help her out with something in the kitchen, and I got all screwed up with following the battle. My notes are fuzzy here, but I do know that Satan666 won it, 3-1 finishing with a 240 damaging critical random hit KO. So I&#39;ll just tell you that and we&#39;ll move on. <BR> <BR>Satan666 vs. Homsar <BR> <BR>Round One-  <BR>The adorable Isobe sarted with a Mocchi Spray for 64 damage, and Satan666 used Bow for 28. Homsar answered with a Monta for 9 damage, and another for 11. Satan666 used Ab Boomerang for 39, and Homsar used another 11-damaging Monta. Satan666 used another Bow for 7 damage, and Homsar finished up with a weak Monta for 3 damage. Satan666 won the battle, 67.7/58.6. <BR> <BR>Round Two- <BR>Satan666 actually hit a Random Hit to start the battle with 104 damage. Homsar, not to be out done &#40;although it was&#41; used it&#39;s best, Mocchi Spray, for 74. Satan666 missed an Ab Boomerang, and Homsar landed a Tounge Lick. Satan666 hit with a Ab Boomerang for 38, and missed a Bow. Homsar tried to comeback with a Monta, but it only did 14 damage and Satan666 won the fight, 68/40. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>Homsar started with Mocchi Spray for 65 damage, and Satan666 landed an Ab Boomerang for 45. It then use Bow for 30, and another Ab Boomerang for 43. Homsar used a 12-damagin Monta and had a Tounge Lick blocked. It was Hit with another Ab Boomerang, but luckily, was spared seriously injury when Satan666 Randomly Missed. Homsar then used a Tounge Lick for... 77 damage? I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s right myself, but it was said. Satan666 still won, so it didn&#39;t matter. <BR> <BR>Satan666 vs. GOD? &#40;The battle between good and evil! Who will win? The Divine Duck-or the Devious Dakkung?&#41; <BR> <BR>Round One- It started with a Three Piece from GOD?, followed by two Ab Boomerangs from Satan666, one missing, and one hitting for 41 damage. Satan666 then decided to call on evil to help it, when it managed to land a Random Hit for 112 damage. GOD? wasn&#39;t done yet, it used a Three Piece for 68 damage, but missed an Ab Boomerang. Satan666 hit with a Bow for 29, and blocked GOD?&#39;s Three Piece attack to win, 77.6/40.3. The first match goes to the dark side. <BR> <BR>Round Two- <BR>The good side came in fighting with GOD?&#39;s Three PIece attack for 56 damage. Satan666 missed a Bow, and GOD? hit another Three Piece, for 55. It also hit a Ab Boomerang for 28. GOD? didn&#39;t get through without a scratch though, it was hit with an Ab Boomerang for 45. GOD? tried another Ab Boomerang, but it missed, and it&#39;s Three Piece was blocked in Satan666&#39;s efforts to win it. The dark side failed this time around, GOD? took Round Two 54.2/85.2. <BR> <BR>Round Three- <BR>The fighting between the two sides got more intense in Round Three. GOD? started by missing an Ab Boomerang, but hitting with another one for 32 damage. It then launched a Three Piece for 57. Satan666 tried a Bow, but it was dodged, and dudged again on the second attempt. Giving up on Bow for a bit, Satan666 tried an Ab Boomerang. It hit for 46, and Satan66 went on to dodge GOD?&#39;s Ab Boomerang. It couldn&#39;t, however- avoid GOD&#39;s awesome Three Piece attack, which really seemed to be doing it for him. It hit for 61, and Satan666 just missed another Bow. It finally hit with one at the end of the battle for 34, but Round Three was over, it had gone to GOD? and the good side. <BR> <BR>Round Four-  <BR>The tension builded in the air between the sides- who would win in the end? Good, or evil? Round Four was about to commence, you can all find out now! It started with a Three Piece by GOD? for 60, and an Ab Boomerang for 33. Satan666 replied by Randomly Missing, something that was not good. GOD? took advantage of this, and started with a flurry of Ab Boomerangs, 3 of them. The first missed, but the second criticaled for 52 damage, and the last hit for 28. Satan666 tried to get out of it, using Bow for 26, and Ab Boomerang for a nice 59, but it was all over. Just like any happy story, &#40;blech&#41; Good triumphed over Evil, and GOD? won Round Four, and the match against Satan666. <BR> <BR>Satan666 1, GOD? 3 <BR> <BR>Satan finished it&#39;s battles, and it was time for Snowdrop to fight. <BR> <BR>Snowdrop vs. Homsar <BR> <BR>Round One- <BR>This battle started with Snowdrop using it&#39;s Mighty Mini Punch for 10 damage. It then used a Muhha, which was blocked. It decided to block itself, stopping a Tounge Lick from Homsar. Snowdrop used another Muhha, this time for 24, and it blocked another one of Homsar&#39;s Tounge Licks. It dodged a Monta, and landed another Mini Punch for 11. Using it again, it did 10 damage, and it then had it&#39;s Surprise blocked by the Isobe.

I probably won&#39;t be here to see what replys this gets &#40;going away&#41; but, tell me: <BR>was it too long? <BR>not descriptive enough? <BR>any other horrific, or not so horrific problems?  <BR>Was it good? I might do it again someday! <BR>Well, this is Mewger, I&#39;m going to bed. &#40;It is 2:38 AM as of right now&#41;  <BR>Bye!

 I&#39;m sure that took forever to type...it&#39;s a little long so the best approach is to key up every fight in one paragraph instead of each round.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a very descriptive recap that tells the tale.

 this is great!  such detail!  the problem is that there were so many monsters, and so many one-sided battles, that it runs a little long.   <BR> <BR>i like it tho.

 Wow, thanks! I didn&#39;t really think that it was good, but I&#39;ve changed my mind now. And you&#39;re right, if I ever do this again, I&#39;m going to recap each fight in one paragraph. &#40;it would save me lots of time.. and let me wake up a bit earlier. it&#39;s 3:22 PM, I have just woken up&#41; Well, it was a fun fight, I&#39;m sure everyone who reads this will think so too.

 one more tiny note, if you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;m here, since I said I was going on a trip, I can&#39;t go, my dad&#39;s shoulder &#40;which was injured&#41; still isn&#39;t better and he can&#39;t take me... v_v <BR>I  can still play MR though, so it&#39;s fine. I hope he&#39;s better soon!
