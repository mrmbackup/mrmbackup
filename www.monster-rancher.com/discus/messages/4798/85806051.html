Well, besides Winona, this was a fight between three AWESOME maxxed mews, the winner was hardly clear until near the end of the tournament. <BR> <BR>Moo vs. Winona: After a missed scratch, a cat fan won the first round for Moo in one hit.  The last two fights were also one-hit KOs against Winona, who had stats far lower than any of her competitors. <BR> <BR>Moo 3, Winona 0 <BR> <BR>Minemi vs. Winona:  Pretty much the same deal, Winona got a couplke of 1 damage hits in, but it was far from being enough to get even close to a win. <BR> <BR>Minemi 3, Winona 0 <BR> <BR>Flo vs. Winona: Three moves, three KOs from Flo...setting a new record for the quickness of a match at 1 second. <BR> <BR>Flo 3, Minmei 0 <BR> <BR>Moo vs. Minmei:  In the first round, Minmei was acting like a winner.  powerful combos of 10:10s and zaps left Moo shivering with a mere 5.1% remaining.  Next, Minmei took it a step further and KO&#39;d Moo with a 10:10 and an outrageous 510 zap.  However...things in MR tourneys can change quickly.  In round 3 Moo and Minmei duked it out with the smaller techs, all leading to a very close finish...in which Moo won by 10%.  In round 4 Moo dominated with no mercy, unleashing two 450&#43; cat fans that left Minmei unconscious on the floor.  In the final round, poor Fenrick had to watch as Minmei&#39;s best attacks missed...losing the match due to a 291 damage cat fan.  Moo had won, but now he had FLo to contend with... <BR> <BR>Moo 3, Minmei 2 <BR> <BR>Moo vs. Flo:  We all thought this would be a close match like the last one.  We were quite wrong.  Flo went berserk like a Chucky doll in the first two rounds, constantly using meows and powerful zaps to get quick KOs.  In round three, Moo threw all that he had at Flo, but Flo&#39;s high speed got in the way...dodging almost every single attack.  Unfortunately for Moo, his speed could not save him from Flo&#39;s mighty meow. <BR> <BR>Flo 3, Moo 0 <BR> <BR>Minmei vs. Flo:  This match had a lot resting on it.  If Minmei would win, there would be the first three-way tie in MR3 tourney history.   <BR>Round one started out looking like this would happen.  Minmei went on a blocking spree, taking the hits with no damage done and dishing it out at Flo to boot, winning 68.7% to 32.5%.  Round 2 was close...Flo hit a 511 10:10...but then Minmei countered with two zaps and won yet again.  In round three, we were all anxiously awaiting the tie.  We were denied.  Flo worked it&#39;s zap magic to win round 3 and murdered Minmei with meows in round 4.  It all came down to the fifth and final round...would Flo take home the gold, or could Minmei scratch out a win?  Flo went crazy from the beginning, getting Minmei down to a mere 2.6% with meows and a cat fan.  Minmei managed not to land a single tech. <BR> <BR>Flo 3, Minmei 2 <BR> <BR>SO there you have it.  All hail Flo!  All hail TheDt!  Be sure to catch the next mayors cup, the Metalner Day Challenge...it&#39;s gonna be a blast for sure!  Good night ranchers!

 YAY!, I knew I trained flo to be a winner. Nice recap Velo, catching every detail. I think that Minmei was a great challenge there, and I had though flo would lose, but just did&#39;nt give up, and turns out, Minmei had a flashback of a previous battle with Moo. Moo was a great Mew, considering the time it was raised in. Well, anyway, I think that this was a great tourey, with 3 great maxxed Mews. Although SS entered a E-Class monster, I respect him for at least entering. I hope you give me a challenge for Kalaragi challenge SS, so good luck on that. <BR> <BR>So, nice recap, and until next tourney!
