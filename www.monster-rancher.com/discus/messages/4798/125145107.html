 We don&#39;t have an exact time yet, but it looks like DeadBuffalo can host bracket three of LC&#39;s MR3 Master&#39;s event on Sunday. Look for updates.

 i know patsy, but i don&#39;t know vectrex, except that he is a rare plant who lisa maxxed. <BR> <BR>patsy is a gutsy little lesione who has proved herself several times...but mostly against other lesiones.  as dead buffalo found out, she is primarily designed to beast other lessies; she didn&#39;t do badly in the tournament of champions, but she didn&#39;t dominate by any means. <BR> <BR>my best plant underperformed in internal matches, losing to monsters several hundred points lower than him with regularity.  but he wasn&#39;t maxxed, and lisa might have greater insight into plant techs than i did. <BR> <BR>we will find out, i suppose.

 Vectrex won the Tank War, at least the tank version of him did. He was intentionally raised as a dual-event monster. I believe that I added one characteristic during the time of raising Speed, so, he isn&#39;t the exact same monster with more Speed. I did try stacking Characteristics while making him, so hopefully he has a good mix. Unfortunately, Fast Footwork did not carry over.

 I haven&#39;t seen the Lesione fight, but I have seen the Plant. Vectrex has the power to own even the toughest of opponents, don&#39;t ever forget it. I&#39;m thinking it&#39;ll be close, but I give the Plant the advantage.

 this is going to be one of the sweetest smelling matches in a while. <BR> <BR>and your plant&#39;s tech array is much better than mine was.

<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
Here is a brief analysis: <BR> <BR>Patsy the Biansnow has a Guts Regen Rate of 90. Vectrex the Akihabana has a rate of 130. This is a very significant difference and will probably be the deciding factor in the outcome. While hosting other events, I have seen Guts differences this great make clear and decisive differences between monsters. But it all depends on how a monster uses those stored guts, so let&#39;s delve deeper. &#40;Both monsters have Sharp Eyes and Sweet Smell, so I will not discuss the effects of these any further.&#41; <BR> <BR><CENTER><B>Patsy</B></CENTER> <BR>Patsy has Loud Voice affecting Lesihorne and Water Secrets affecting Tsunami. Life Secrets possibly affects Tail Whip. So, all attacks probably have an extra boost.  <BR> <BR>All 3 attacks have excellent hit % numbers of 50 or more. Two of the attacks have fairly low guts costs &#40;20 &#43;23&#41; but their damage is lower &#40;12&#43;27&#41;. Lesihorne&#39;s 12 damage for 20 guts may cost Patsy the event, if the Plant can build guts to hit a lot harder while the Lesione is nibbling at its roots. Tsunami is clearly the showcase attack with 57 Damage, hit % of 50, and guts cost of 50. Hopefully the AI will allow her to use it, rather than favoring the cheaper techs. There is a chance that Lesihorne will be used repeatedly while the opponent gets to use harder-hitting techs.  <BR> <BR>Overall, most of Patsy&#39;s Chars are offensively oriented with the exception of Sweet Smell, which is matched by Vectrex&#39;s Sweet Smell. <BR> <BR><CENTER><B>Vectrex</B></CENTER> <BR>Vectrex&#39;s attacks are all Beat type, and Life Wisdom hopefully affects all of them -but it may not, leaving all of his un-boosted while Patsy clearly has two attacks affected by Chars. Sensitive had better be a &#39;ranch only&#39; trait, or it could turn out to be deadly in the arena. Not enough research has been done to know for sure.  <BR> <BR>All 4 of Vectrex&#39;s attacks have higher guts costs on average than Patsy&#39;s. The difference being that the average damage is higher as well. &#40;guts: 40, 45, 42, 50&#41; &#40;damage: 26, 31, 48, 54&#41; Since Vectrex&#39;s guts regen is faster, the higher guts cost is not so much of an issue, if looked at in relation to the damage involved. The guts costs are all very close to each other, thus the game AI will not tend to favor one attack heavily over others based on guts. Where some techs may hurt him is in how well they connect. Some attacks have lower hit% than Patsy&#39;s &#40;48, 58, 38, 37&#41; and this is what will level the playing field in favor of Patsy.  <BR> <BR>Vectrex does have one Defensive Char in addition to Sweet Smell: Armor. Armor does reduce the ability to dodge incoming attacks &#40;adding to Patsy&#39;s advantage in accuracy of attacks&#41;, but can significantly reduce damage from them. This Char may be very beneficial if Lesihorne is used a lot. <BR><CENTER>&#42;&#42;&#42;</CENTER> <BR> <BR>Overall, this battle will be very close, as all Master level events are. Patsy has low guts regen as her weak spot, while Vectrex has lower hit % on two attacks and higher overall guts cost as his weakness. How well either of these monsters will use their assets remains to be seen. My personal recommendation &#40;straightforward and old-skool&#41; would be to go with the monster with better Guts: Vectrex.

 Looks like we&#39;re good. 9PM EST tonight in the MRM chat room, battle of the mods! This is like Iron Chef Japanese vs Iron Chef French, it can&#39;t be missed! Patsy, Torey&#39;s most pestersome creation as he pointed out above, will go up against Lisa&#39;s equally victorious Vectrex. If you can&#39;t stand other events because you always forget what the monster&#39;s stats are, this is the event for you. <BR> <BR>Best 5 of 9, hope to see you all there tonight!

 One additional note, I was correct in recalling that Vectrex had gotten one more Char while moving from being a tank to a Master class monster. He got Resists Heat, which knocked Sensitive off the chart.

 The dust has settled, and after a grueling 8 matches we have a winner. Lisa and Vectrex are going to the finals, baby! 5-3, Patsy put up a great fight, but couldn&#39;t beat the plant, including two matches where she was knocked out. All hail Lisa! All hail Vectrex! <BR> <BR>Thank you all who attended &#40;haha&#41;, a very enjoyable event to host, i look forward to seeing the final resolution in the MR3 saga. Thats right, the clash of 3 titans, the MR3 Master&#39;s Class Finale! See you there!

 I&#39;d like to thank Dead Buffalo for hosting the event! This is one of the last of the LegendCup tournaments, and certainly very anticipated on my part. Patsy was a tough opponent who did not give up easily. Thanks to all who attended! We should be having a couple more LC events soon, to complete all of the unfinished business.
