<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2"><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">A CLASS MORNING LINE</FONT></FONT></CENTER> <BR> <BR>A new day and a new bracket begins.  With that in mind, I have a traditional favorite winning this week&#39;s A class kick-off: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Breed</TD><TD>Trainer</TD><TD>Odds </TD></TR><TR><TD>Luffy</TD><TD>Scaled Hare</TD><TD>GoGators</TD><TD>8-5 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dur 2-Attack</TD><TD>Lorica</TD><TD>Slapshotz</TD><TD>5-2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Griphook</TD><TD>Kato</TD><TD>Griphook</TD><TD>4-1 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Rinowa</TD><TD>Noble Jell</TD><TD>CHB</TD><TD>9-2</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Hares tend to do well in these brackets, and <B>Luffy</B> has the pow and techs to continue that tradition.  He will have to dodge, as he is a little light on the lif/def axis, but he will dish out some punishment.  The durahan revival continues with <B>Dur 2-Attack</B>, who has all the good attributes of the neo-modern durahan, and the big negative - 254 spd.  With a little luck, this guy could win, however. <BR> <BR>Then we come to two monsters who are well built statistically, but whose techs don&#39;t quite match up.  Welcome <B>Griphook</B>, who felt good enough about his Kato to give him his name.  If the tabby cat somehow sticks to 3d range, he could shock the field...but he has a 2/3 chance of dealing out insipid pow techs.  A slight bit worse is a newcomer breed, the Jell.  <B>Rinowa</B> has a nice back row, and good lif/def, but is saddled with weak pow techs in 3 slots, and 120 spd probably will leave him open to hits too often in this affair. <BR> <BR>Good luck to all!

Well, they goeth here ^_^ <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s make a table, kiddies! <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Breed</TD><TD>Trainer</TD><TD>Comp </TD></TR><TR><TD>Luffy</TD><TD>Hare/Zuum</TD><TD>GoGators</TD><TD>88 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dur 2-Attack</TD><TD>Durahan/Dragon</TD><TD>SlapShotz</TD><TD>89 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Griphook</TD><TD>Kato</TD><TD>Griphook</TD><TD>90 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Rimowa</TD><TD>Jell/Gali</TD><TD>CHB</TD><TD>90</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Phew, that&#39;s hard work. Anyway... <BR> <BR>Luffy is a bunny! Bunnies are good! However, it loses about 150 def thanks to its form, and it would really be better off with 5 levels shaved off the useless Int and put towards either Life or Def. Still, he&#39;ll do well if he can use Big Bang in a timely manner and get a little luck on his side. Definately my favorite for the round, though, mostly by default. Won&#39;t expect him to do as well in the final. <BR> <BR>Dur 2-Attack.. well, I don&#39;t really like Durahans, nor do I like monsters with numbers in their names, heh. Actually, I think it has some chance in this tourney but I don&#39;t think it has the power to sweep any battle. I don&#39;t like his odds, overall. <BR> <BR>Griphook has a bit of an identity crisis going on. His stats scream &#34;INT!&#34; while his techs are clearly leaning the other direction. The combination of the fact that 2/3 of his techs will do less than 20 damage and his terrible life results in me having no faith at all in his abilities in a CPU-controlled battle. <BR> <BR>Rimowa- Simply put, combo pow/int monsters haven&#39;t done well at all in A-class. However, he still has a good amount of life, and the low speed won&#39;t be too much of a problem. I&#39;d expect him to beat Griphook and one other, then possibly get in to a playoff. Jell Copter is great, and if he&#39;s able to hit with it I would almost guarantee success. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s my thoughts; in a condensed form, I&#39;m going with: <BR> <BR>1- Luffy <BR>2- Rimowa <BR>3- Dur 2-Attack <BR>4- Griphook <BR> <BR>-Kevin

Well, I might as well post my predictions too, even though the next tourney is gonna be A class #3 finale :&#41; <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Trainer</TD><TD>Odds </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dur 2-Attack</TD><TD>SlapShotz</TD><TD>1-2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Luffy</TD><TD>GoGators</TD><TD>2-5 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Rimoa</TD><TD>CHB</TD><TD>1-3 </TD></TR><TR><TD>GRIPHOOK</TD><TD>Griphook</TD><TD>1-8</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Things are looking fresh for A class #4. The powerful Jell makes it&#39;s first watery appearance in a Legend Cup Tourney, as well as another rarely entered breed - Kato. And also we got our weekly durahan, and Luffy the stretchy gum-gum pirate hare to join in the chaos! <BR> <BR>Luffy - This Hare definately has power... and speed... and skill! But two things he&#39;s lacking are life and defense. Being slim doesn&#39;t help much, because he loses defense and gains no speed at all. Maybe not 150 points, more like around 50 points. Against Dur 2, sure he would inflict some damage but I doubt he could get through his massive life and defense before he gets KO&#39;d by a few strong attacks. His big advantages such as max speed, power, skill, and tons of strong techs could give him the victory. <BR> <BR>Dur 2-Attack - Unlike movies, this sequel is actually a major improvement to the first! Max life, power, skill and defense should give him major advantages over the competition. He&#39;s got some decent techs, namely rush slash and slash combo. Slash Combo will definately kill Luffy and possibly GRIPHOOK &#40;yes, it&#39;s all capitals&#41; instantly if it hits. His normal form compliments his stats perfectly, so that he doesn&#39;t lose anything. The downsides of Dur 2 are that he has a risky move Deathbringer and barely any speed. I expect him to get first unless Rimoa or Luffy manage to get through his massive life and defense with overwelmingly strong attacks.  <BR> <BR>GRIPHOOK - Congrats to Griphook&#39;s first entrant! <BR>this Kato&#39;s stats are just really odd. He&#39;s got max int, skill, speed AND defense but has no power at all and below average life. His slim form cuts off a couple levels of defense while he gains no speed from it. Being strictly an int monster while having only power techs taking up the first 2 rows will probably be this monster&#39;s downfall. He could win somehow if he&#39;s lucky and chooses the int techs. <BR> <BR>Rimoa - Ahhh, the first Jell entered in Legend Cup... He&#39;s got some nice stats like max defense, int, and skill. He&#39;s also got decent life and power to boot. Being normal is good with this monster as well, because his stats remain the same and don&#39;t lose anything like Luffy and GRIPHOOK. He&#39;s got some incredible Jell techs like Gatling Gun and Jell Copter, and if he chooses these in a fight the tides will be turned in his favor. The problem with Rimoa is that he&#39;s both an int and a power monster so he has to either give up some power or int and have some attacks do less damage, or give up some other stats to keep damage consistant. Also he has no speed at all and will get hit with anything and everything. Rimoa will have to KO opponents fast to make it to the finals.

 I&#39;m not going to plop out who I think will win, because I think I will and thats a given. :P <BR> <BR>But, I did plan for the physical moves more than you think. I.e. All of his physical moves don&#39;t cost very much guts. To balance, however, most of his int. based moves use quiet a bit. <BR> <BR>Short point: this was the stoping point I choose for Rimowa, I have actually continued to raise him. He wasn&#39;t engineered for A class, but I just entered him with his stats at 90. <BR> <BR>Now that he is at 106, I&#39;ll enter him in the S tourney, too.

 On Second thought, I will... <BR> <BR>Luffy: Trained by GoGators <BR> <BR>Speed, Power, and Skill being maxxed is a good thing, especially for Hares. Top that off with the record this breed has, plus their luck, and you have a nasty bugger. Techs are solid, but Hare&#39;s don&#39;t need much to have a good tech list. As in every A class monster entry, there will be a down side. For this guy, it is his ability to take a hit. Not only does the low life and def set him up to take big physical, but the low int and being slim makes him vulnerable to virtually everything. The trick to this, is hitting him. Expect some fancy footwork from him, but he still as a problem that all his foe have max Def. and Skill, the stats he really didn&#39;t need them to have. <BR> <BR>Dur2: Trained by SlapShotz <BR> <BR>The Durahan trend kicks in the first bracket of this set with a slammer. The advantage he easily has over EVERYONE is maxxed life. Geared only for the physical fighting style, he is bred to represent the raw power of the Durahan&#39;s, and Slappy set him up very well in his forte. The downside, of course, speed and int. These are standard for most tanks anyway, but holding a normal form lets him hang on to the little speed he has. Hard pressed to knock out the little Hare or the nimble Kato, but they will be equally pressed in dropping his 999 life. Unless Griphook lays out some Tornado Claws. Rimowa will have to go toe-to-toe with him, but only if he plays it smart will the Jell come out on top. <BR> <BR>Griphook: Trained by Griphook <BR> <BR>Some martial arts teach that, &#34;The best defense for an attack is to not be where it lands.&#34; Well, Griphook wouldn&#39;t care anyway. This guy seems bent on defenses, having maxxed Speed, Int, and Def, he has made himself a very hard opponent to counter for physical and int. based monsters alike. However, the life shot drops most of this out the window anyway &#40;except the speed&#41;. Being slim doesn&#39;t help at ALL. It knocks out some def. for NO gain, as has been stated already. Even if he was normal though, it wouldn&#39;t change the outcome too much. If he takes the hit, he takes it, and it will hurt his life. The only distance this little guy has a chance in is third. The first two are dwindling power based attacks &#40;Griphook&#39;s pow. is 24&#41;, and the forth distance doesn&#39;t even have so much as a Phantom Claw. My final say on him is that he can pull some surprises if need be. Lay some nasty int. based hits into Luffy and Dur2 and he may have a chance. Hurting Rimowa will be a little difficult, but with his speed, he could pull an upset on anyone, just like Luffy. <BR> <BR>Rimowa: Trained by Cyberhillbilly &#40;CHB&#41; <BR> <BR>Mine. I didn&#39;t aim for A class, but I saved him on a different slot when he was at 90 and decided to enter him in. A charactor in my new story, he is only the same monster by name, being both a good monster and intelligent to boot. Either way, my quest for the tank continues. Griphook has int. potential &#40;to a low percentage&#41;, but I&#39;d say Rimowa is the monster with the int. techs in this round. Consisting of hard hitting moves like Gattling Gun, Jell Cannon &#40;Low hit%, but mad damage&#41;, and the all mighty Jell Copter &#40;S Force, A hit%&#41;. Decent power techs with low guts cost will let his average damaging physical moves build into a constant volley, and only slightly hamper his ability to use his int. to the max, though they cost a good chunk of guts more. With that said, he couldn&#39;t dodge a rolling can of soda. Normal form holds his speed at what it is, but that doesn&#39;t mask the fact that the DURAHAN is faster than he is. In a max skill tourney &#40;as most are&#41;, this obviously is not important to him. He knows he is not meant to dodge &#40;hence the Def.&#41;. Either way, he is slow, but his offensive skills are sound. With two speedsters and one physical tank, it&#39;ll come down to how well he makes his shots in every fight. In all honesty, no monster here could take the Int. based techs he can toss out &#40;if they hit&#41;. Griphook may have int, but it doesn&#39;t change the life Griphook has. The decent life of Rimowa will help him, but it still pales in comparision to Dur2&#39;s. <BR> <BR>In short... <BR> <BR>Luffy: Bouncing, fast, Heavy hitter <BR>Dur2: Slow, Enduring, Heavy hitter <BR>Griphook: Fast, Resilient, Speedster <BR>Rimowa: Slow, Intelligent, Omni-offensive <BR> <BR>Ranking: <BR>1&#41;Rimowa <BR>2&#41;Dur2 <BR>3&#41;Luffy <BR>4&#41;Griphook <BR> <BR>I put Dur2 over the speedsters because he only needs to hit once, neither can take that kind of life hit and deal back as much to his 999. I put Luffy over Griphook because the Kato might be able to pull some int. moves out for damage, but that&#39;s vs. Luffy&#39;s solid physical schematics that will constantly be raining on Grip. <BR> <BR>Looking forward to this fight more than the finals for the other. :P

 Dur&#39;s gonna rolling slash at the beginning, Luffy&#39;s going to Bang everyone up, Griphook won&#39;t dish out much damage, and I hope Rimowa slingshots a lot.  Withering&#39;s fun against low guts regen.

 toado, i think you messed up your odds to win...i could be wrong though. but, i just dont get 1-2,2-5,1-3,1-8. they look backwards to me.

 Well the ones I put are supposed to be like 1 out of 2, 2 out of 5, 1 out of 3 etc. I just didn&#39;t do it right I guess... Now I realize how stupid it looks after seeing torey luvullo&#39;s odds. Just ignore my odds, the order from top to bottom is all that matters.

 Fine whatever you say &#42;sigh&#42;...  <BR>Luffy-One of my better teched monsters,he has a full aresnal of killer techs,but what will doom him is his crappy gut regen or not so fast gut regen and the Bangs high gut but hit percentage helps so the fights might not last long after one of them.The Smashs will hit alot on everyone except Griphook so he does have a chance to win seeing as Griphook has no techs that would absolutley slaughter him.He might be what I need to regain confidence in myself and forget about all the other beatings.  <BR> <BR>Dur 2-Attack-He has killer attacks much like Dur,he was able to beat Exzee with them,but after fighting Exzee with my other monsters so was Sonansu &#40;able to beat Exzee&#41; and Sonansu didn&#39;t fight too well now did he.Luffy has one thing over Dur 2-Attack,Speed.Speed is what wins matches.Forget about Sandosarus because he was with tanks too so he didn&#39;t have troubles there.Dur 2-Attack will not be as surpising as his Father or brother or mom or whatever when he wins a match or round.He has alot of good tech,but he won&#39;t use them often his best bet is a quick kill over everyone with Rolling Slash,I believe that&#39;s what Rygar used to win his matches.&#40;I wasn&#39;t there back then,but I read recaps ;&#41; &#41;  <BR> <BR>Griphook-The second Kato to be entered in Fenricks tourneys,after an unsuccessful Tainted Cat.I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll fair too much better than him because atleast Placebo has fitting techs with his stats and having maxxed defense along with only 400 some Life won&#39;t protect him too much from a Jell Copter,Rolling Slash or Bang.It is a nice first monster from Griphook,but it would be better as a brag to your friends monster,not trying to diss Griphook too much,but it still has a chance wth the dodging part of his maxxed speed,still it won&#39;t help against my Hare&#39;s Bangs or the Jell&#39;s Far range.I see him in last,but i&#39;m trying not to place everyone.  <BR> <BR>Rimmowa-A nice first Jell in Fenricks tourney.He has all the killer Jell Attacks,but chances of Jell Copter being used are lowered with all the other attacks in that range,Hoppers suffer like that too.He doesd have lots of kill attacks in that range though unlike Hoppers so he will do tons of damage and hit often,he will be a nice rememberance as the first Jell although I thought of one for a long time,but I didn&#39;t want a tank in this kinda of tourney,but when you have another tank in it,it doesn&#39;t hurt your odds too much espically with the high hit percented attacks he has.I think he&#39;ll squeeze one out over Griphook and Dur 2-Attack,but when it comes to Luffy I see plenty of Smashes in it,but one Jell Copter could show him,then theres Grit.I&#39;m looking forward to that fight looking at all the possiblities that could take place.  <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;  <BR>Let&#39;s break it down...  <BR>Luffy-Has Speed and tech and alittle bit of defense.  <BR>Dur 2-Attack-Lots of kill techs no gut regen to use attack constantly.  <BR>Griphook-Good defense,no attacks.  <BR>Rimowa-Not so great guts,nice techs.  <BR>Welcome to the fight with 2 or 3 attacks in the whole match,ton&#39;s of KO&#39;s will be in store.Now that I think about it I like my chances with two low gut regen monsters that are tanks and a techless Kato.I might just pull one out.

 toado&#39;s odds are fine, and add up appropriately, he just expresses them the opposite way. where my odds show that a monster is &#34;3-1 chance against winning&#34;; toado&#39;s just turns it around and is read &#34;1 in 3 chance of winning.&#34; <BR> <BR>i think the hare gets to win, on first glance.  i will get more in depth as the tourney draws near.

 Just a point to the Jell&#39;s physical tech&#39;s gut costs: <BR> <BR>Jell Top: 17 <BR>Whip: 14 <BR>Jell Cube: 16 <BR>Stab: 11 <BR>Suffocation: 24 <BR> <BR>Even without the Int. techs, I still think he could knock a lot out of Luffy with these attacks &#40;dealing a decent chunk of damage to a life bar that maxes out at 501&#41;. Plus, they don&#39;t cost that much, which means he&#39;ll have the guts to use the big int. moves, and only four of those are big cost to guts. <BR> <BR>Cannon: 35 <BR>Slingshot: 18 <BR>Gatling Gun: 45 <BR>Jell Copter: 50 <BR>Beam Gun: 18 <BR>Beam Cannon: 35 <BR> <BR>I did plan for the guts dilema ahead of time, and the flaw here is if he misses with one of the big guts moves. Copter and Gatling are high hit%, Cannon has a D%,  and Beam Cannon has a C. <BR> <BR>True, two speed monsters might get away from these, and Dur2 will be slugging toe-to-toe with Rimowa, I still think that Luffy&#39;s life won&#39;t hold up to only a couple of shots, even if he does dodge some. Still, it will be quiet interesting, there is always the chance for crits...

 To knock out the question of regen rates... <BR> <BR>Luffy- 14 <BR>Dur2- 15.5 <BR>Griphook- 17 <BR>Rimowa- 15.5 <BR> <BR>Rimowa and Dur2 are tied, obviously, but bashing the Hare&#39;s guts regen is misplaced, since in this bracket, it is the fastest. Albeit, the finals will say different, for now, he does have the fastest regen.

 All in all, gonna be some good fights, regardless of who wins. &#40;I hope&#41; <BR> <BR>Its just that no two monsters in this bracket are similair, I.E. There are two tanks, but not both power. There are two fast guys, but both not int. based. Just a wide spectrum of monsters that should put on quite a show.

 Back to the tourney! <BR> <BR>Quite frankly, this is anyone&#39;s game. Even Griphook has the ability to completely demolish someone, as does every single monster here. <BR> <BR>And, in my opinion, the Hare luck to dodge is only based on the opposing monster&#39;s luck to hit. :P <BR> <BR>But, looking over the monsters, its really anyone&#39;s bracket, but I think there might be a tie, even a three way tie possibly.

 I really need to do those guts regens.. <BR> <BR>Luffy - 14 <BR>Rimowa - 15 &#40;Without checking&#41; <BR>Dur 2-Attack - 15 <BR>Griphook - 17 <BR> <BR>Hurray for low guts regen.  It&#39;ll probably be a boring match, with such few hits, but who knows, maybe the kato will get in 2 tornado claws, get beat up, throw one more, then never do it again.  This is of course guessing that he&#39;ll coincidentally be in that range with tornado claw selected.  It&#39;s not that much stronger than twister. <BR> <BR>For rimowa, he&#39;s going to lose to dur 2-attack unless he somehow hits with all int techs 3 rounds.  Both no speed, but durahan with more pack in it&#39;s punch. <BR> <BR>Despite Griphook&#39;s max defense, look at that life!  449, man, hit with twister slash and be critical, then like...charge.  Won&#39;t take much, but max speed and low guts don&#39;t go well together. <BR> <BR>I like Luffy&#39;s techs.  Back Blow, Heavy Blow.  Smash, Heavy Smash.  Bang, Big Bang.  Nice chains.  Not to mention they hurt a lot for pretty low guts cost &#40;Besides the bangs&#41;  His downfall?  Intelligence he could&#39;ve sapped into life/defense.  But who knows?  8 ball almost won his bracket and he was pretty much like luffy. <BR> <BR>Dur 2-Attack, another durahan, another Lorica.  Is that Deathbringer?  Man, 2nd Durahan to have Deathbringer in A.  I like Lorica so I hope his techs hit.  Make him have Sandosaurus luck, I say!

 I&#39;ll admit, the S class version of Rimowa is much more impressive, but we have a lack of monsters in that rank.

 For the guts, I don&#39;t know if there are .5 numbers or not, but Dur2 and Rimowa are tied at 15.5

 It&#39;s usually &#40;There are exceptions to the rule&#41; rounded to the base&#39;s guts regen. <BR> <BR>Durahan - 14 <BR>Arrowhead - 17 <BR>Lorica - 15.5, rounds to 15 <BR> <BR>Durahan - 14 <BR>Pixie - 7 <BR>Lesziena - 10.5, rounds to 11 <BR> <BR>Lorica&#39;s rounds down to get closer to 14, Lesziena rounds up to get closer to 14. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t use that for every breed, such as Astro.  Should be 12, but he&#39;s 13.  Same goes for /Pixie, /Tiger, /Plant.  Those 3 have a 14, even if Pixie should be 13.  Anyway, eventually I&#39;ll do the guts of every monster so people don&#39;t have to calculate.

 Okay,i&#39;ve heard alot of this not agreeing with the height of Luffy&#39;s int.Heres the scoop.As you may of known Luffy was not meant to be in A Class he was amde for the Market thing in which I did a battle method on him.Therefore he was stuck with the stats he got and I didn&#39;t care what was raised as long as it was raised.Then I heard people wanted to see what Luffy could do in A Class so I finished him.I had no special plans for him except get his Skill to level 20 and raise everything else till his bloodly death!Now you know :&#41;

 FYI Gogators, <BR> <BR>Monsters in A class always have a weakness, if not several. I have never seen an A class entry that could not be better in any way. <BR> <BR>In this bracket: <BR> <BR>Luffy needs Int. <BR>Griphook needs Pow. stat or Int. based techs <BR>Dur2 needs speed <BR>Rimowa needs a miracle <BR> <BR>Enough said.

 Hey, SS, feeling froggy? <BR> <BR>Jump into S class, chump! :D <BR> <BR>&#40;This one will have good matches, but I have much more faith in the S class version&#41; <BR> <BR>Besides, I know Rimowa will have a few wins here, but I don&#39;t know if he&#39;ll win the tourney.

 You want trash-talking Strunks?  <BR>Rimowa first won&#39;t beat Luffy because he&#39;s slower than crap can get hit by Smashes and Bangs and Blows all night long.And he won&#39;t be able to hit.Whats the chances of a Jell Copter?Slim,just like Griphook&#39;s form which won&#39;t be too helpful one Luffy sets in a BIG BANG in that ugly striped cat and I thought stripes made people look fat.Dur 2-Attack what kinda name is that?He also a Durahan too.A Durahan with a bad name high costing techs and no decent gut regen won&#39;t help him.Whats the chance of an E Hit % on a maxxed out Speed monster?Low!Whereas Luffy will smash dents in his ugly crab butt all night!  <BR>Is that good enough Strunks? =P

 Froggy huh? More like groggy CHB, but i am working on a Joker for S class as we speak. Hopefully i can finish it sometime soon. <BR> <BR>Oh, GG, btw, i will have Dur2-Attack holding his NEW lucky RABBIT FOOT by the end of Sunday ight.

 Ive never seen so much talk about one bracket :&#92; <BR> <BR>1st - Dur2 <BR>2nd - Luffy <BR>3rd - Griphook <BR>4th - Rimowa <BR> <BR>Griphook will only get 3rd if he uses his int moves at least half the time, and the first two i for one think will be close, and it could go either way.

 Rimowa will have a catch on Dur2, that&#39;s given, but even when I slap Luffy&#39;s fuzzy little butt with physical moves, he&#39;ll be reeling. With only 500 life and around the same defense, I won&#39;t NEED Jell Copter to finish of this duracel flunky. &#40;can&#39;t spell duracel, oh well.&#41; Griphook will have a similar falling out, because if Tornado Claws isn&#39;t going to hurt someone, its Rimowa. As far as percentiles, he&#39;ll have Griphook easy, if not K.O.ed. Dur2 is gonna be a hitch, power moves aren&#39;t going to rock him, but if Rimowa lays out any kind of stratagy/luck and uses int. moves, that sappy sword swinger will be right back in the museum. <BR> <BR>Good luck in the tourney guys. :P

 Luffy didn&#39;t want to be Normal he wanted to be Slim,so he died when ever I tried to fatten him up anywho.First of all how would two Tank&#39;s be able to beat a Hare with kill techs?If there&#39;s a way tell me I wanna here that.Look at my only non-tank competition,a techless Kato.I laugh at him.&#42;Laughs&#42;Let&#39;s go over this fight shall we....  <BR>Luffy vs. Griphook;Round 1: Big Bang Luffy,CRIT!!!! 748 KO repeat twice.  <BR>Luffy vs. Rimowa; Round 1:Jell Cube oh my,MISSED!Wheres that Speed?In your defense!Heavy Smash!No dodging for you!999!!!!Repeat twice.  <BR>Luffy vs. Dur 2-Attack;Round 1:Slash Combo,it&#39;s a miss!!!!!!!No more guts for Dur 2-Attack,but first Dur 2-Attack meet my fist,999 Heavy Smash!It&#39;s the story of the night,Luffy dominates.  <BR>Then I wake up.....
