<B> Deadbuffalo&#39;s Divination</B> <BR> <BR>In slot one we have a very thin Sofia who has proven to be 2nd best in torey&#39;s collection of obscenely strong monsters.  I wouldn&#39;t sacrafice any goats in praise of her yet though, as while she is maxed, 2 of her higher damage techs are stuck in the long range slot, as well as having a level 1 lick, which will either burn Sofia&#39;s guts trying it, or her enemy&#39;s guts if it connects. Sofia is a good monster, and will prove to be a tough opponent, but the skies do not foretell her victory. <BR> <BR>In slot two we have Reily. Campster&#39;s tech choice for Reily seems to follow the strategy &#34;its gunna hurt if it hits&#34;. The accuracies on Aim boom and Do Mi So are not too high, but the damage is there. Bowling strays from that pattern by having high accuracy along with high damage. Aim hit provides low damage at a low cost, but that might hinder Reily&#39;s chances rather than help them. Reily is a monster who the crystal ball remains blurry for; I&#39;d say he has a good shot at winning. Don&#39;t kill the goat yet, but you can start finding the fatest ones of the herd. <BR> <BR>In slot three we have Halo, champion of the Pixies. I&#39;ve tried to imagine Halo winning, but I can&#39;t see her making it; even with an additional 549 power. The techs are just not there. Raycast does too little damage as do star light and fairy dust &#40;for its guts cost&#41;. However, Halo is still the champion of the pixies and should be honored. But the fates work in mysterious ways. Halo may emerge from the dust alive and victorious.  <BR> <BR>In the fourth and final slot, we have Pokylyps. His stone body may be a solid defense, but it could also be a solid weakness, especially against opponents with lower accuracy techs. His techs are almost all very high damage. However it is unlikely we will see more than 1 olega meteor or tornado punch per match, with golem&#39;s slow guts regen. Rock slide will be Pokylyps&#39;s dominant attack, being a lower guts cost tech and in the only tech in the middle slot. Whether it will be effective has yet to be determined. I will now toot my own horn. Pokylyps will win. His stone body will crash down upon his enemies and grind their nauseatingly cute bones to a fine dust. And if he loses.... The wrath of his master will be far worse. <BR> <BR>There are going to be some superb fights, I&#39;ll see you there on Monday.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2"><FONT COLOR="119911">TOREY&#39;S MORNING LINE</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER> <BR> <BR>Wow!  This is going to be a great tournament.  Three maxxed monsters, and one very good one, make for some interesting battles.  Here&#39;s a second opinion. <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Breed</TD><TD>Trainer</TD><TD>Odds </TD></TR><TR><TD>Pokylyps</TD><TD>Golem</TD><TD>Deadbuffalo</TD><TD>9-5 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Reilly</TD><TD>Kuririn</TD><TD>Campster</TD><TD>5-2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Sofia</TD><TD>Usazo</TD><TD>toreyluvullo</TD><TD>5-2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Halo</TD><TD>Angel</TD><TD>ShadowFusion</TD><TD>5-1</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>I had no idea that <B>Pokylyps</B> had gotten so strong!  Looking at him now, his techs are going to be more infrequent, but hit much harder than the others.  I had assumed that my favorite would be either <B>Reilly</B> or <B>Sofia</B>, based on discussions I&#39;ve had with the campster.  But both of these monsters have some troubles - Sofia is emaciated, and Reilly has a short-range weakness...obviously, a win from either would not be an upset, but i think the golem is slightly more logical in this spot.  As for <B>Halo</B>, she is the one nonmaxxed monster, with only 450 pow.  This does not have any effect against the Superior Suzurin and Sizzling Suezo, whose entire repetoires are int.  However, the Gruesome Golem is another matter...in this unclear tourney, the most likely event is that <B>Pokylyps</B> gets to beat <B>Halo</B>.  So, you take that one loss, and then add in the fact that her techs are somewhat undeveloped, and i think the Petulant Pixie is a longshot. <BR> <BR>This is gonna be so much fun!
