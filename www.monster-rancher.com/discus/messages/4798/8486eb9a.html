This was definitely a fun tournament to watch.  Ably announced by Hellraiser, and rendered exciting by the participants&#39; combination of extreme striking power, and feeble dodging power, a good size crowd of 10-14 for much of the night was well entertained. <BR> <BR>With six monsters in a round robin format, the tournament took 5 rounds, 3 matches per round.  I was there most of the first 3; here is my recap. <BR> <BR><B>ROUND ONE</B>  Car Lie Al and Evil Eye opened up the festivities with an excellent 5 rounder.  The Naga&#39;s topnotch techs had the wailing Whale down 2-1, before a bevy of Carl&#39;s hardhitting techs led to two straight KO&#39;s and a come-from-behind victory, Carl 3, Evil Eye 2. <BR> <BR>Kung Pao vs Conan saw the first miss of the night - a Conan Earthquake.  Conan got an Earthquake in Power to win one match, and had a chance to win another, but chose the putrid Tidal Wave &#91;with 80 int&#93;, sealing the 3-1 victory for the spicy Baku. <BR> <BR>Steel Blade vs HCl Acid saw Acid totally dominate; except for a 999 Triple Slash in Power by the doughty durahan.  Otherwise, it was all Baku - 3-1. <BR> <BR><B>ROUND TWO</B> Car Lie Al vs Conan.  Whale vs Whale led off the second round.  Except for one Wave Riding KO, all matches went to %, and Carl won 3-1. <BR> <BR>Evil Eye vs HCl Acid was a truly bizarre match.  The first two matches followed the same pattern...Evil would hit a drill attack or turn assault, and Acid would nap it off for full recovery.  However, the combination of the gutsdown of Evil Eye&#39;s techs and the cost of the naps led to the naughty naga finishing off both matches with a winning blow.  Down 2-0, Acid came back with 2 punishing diving presses to tie the score.  Round 5 saw a return of the &#34;napster&#34; pattern - but this time, Evil Eye&#39;s final tech was neutralized with yet another nap.  For the first time ever, a deciding match went to a tiebreaker at 100% to 100%.  The naga dominated the tiebreaker system, and won 3-2 over the baleful baku. <BR> <BR>Kung Pao vs Steel Blade.  I did laundry.  I learned that Kung Pao won 3-1, with the durahan&#39;s one win coming on an impressive triple slash. <BR> <BR><B>ROUND THREE</B>  Car Lie Al took Steel Blade apart, winnning 3-1. <BR> <BR>The battle of bakus then commenced - Kung Pao vs Acid.  It was back and forth throughout.  Kung Pao used a 854 diving press to crush his fellow dog in match 1; Acid made good use of his nap in the second to even the score.  Acid tried a power nap in the third, and recovered some 800 points, but a last minute dust cloud by the Chinese Chicken gave him an 87-81% win, and a 2-1 lead.  Acid tongued KP to death to again even the score, and set up a deciding fifth.  The ultimate match was anticlimactic, with Kung Pao using several little techs to eke out a % victory and win 3-2. <BR> <BR>Conan vs Evil Eye was another very exciting match.  Conan was badly beaten in match one when a last second earthquake shook the hell out of the nasty naga.  Perhaps overconfident, Conan began match 2 by inflicting 94 damage on himself with a rare missed press, and Evil Eye capitalized with more hits to even the score.  Each KO&#39;d the other in Rounds 3 and 4, once again setting up a deciding fifth.  Evil Eye used the occasion to uncork his secret weapon - life steal!  Conan averted the KO, but only by clinging to 2 life, as Evil Eye cemented a 3-2 come-from-behind victory. <BR> <BR>So as I stumbled off to bed, Carl and Kung Pao were 3-0, and Evil Eye had jumped back into contention at 2-1.  I see that things changed in the final two rounds, but i will leave those to another scribe.

Allright, taking Torey&#39;s place as scribe, I recorded the final two rounds, which proved to be interesting indeed. I&#39;ll try to make a good follow-up to his first half descripion, but it&#39;ll be difficult. <BR> <BR><B>ROUND FOUR</B>  <BR> <BR>The fourth round began with a battle between Car Lie Al and HCI Acid. Acid tongued his way through the first round, and at the line, he won, besting Car Lie Al by a close 14.6%. In round two, Carl Powers up, but is flattened by two earth-shaking Diving Presses, and Acid wins through extreme overkill. Round three was as far as this battle went, with Acid tongueing Carl and then Napping away the damage from his Earthquake. A Diving Press by Acid sealed the deal and at the rounds end, it was HCI Acid who won, making a 3/0 victory over Car Lie Al. <BR> <BR>In Kung Poa vs. Evil Eye, Evil Eye began his usual tactics, opening with a damaging Turn Assault, but Kung Poa more than evened out the score with a 999 sharp damaging Diving Press KO. Despite Evil Eye&#39;s Life Stealing in the second round, Kung Poa once again prevailed with some heavy damaging Bites and a Toungue Slap to seal the deal. Round three was the exact same as round one, except that Evil Eye opened with a Drill Attack this time. Kung Poa launched a Diving Press and KO&#39;d Evil Eye for the third time in a row. Final score: Kung Poa 3/0, all wins by KO.  <BR> <BR>Next up was Steel Blade vs. Conan. Seemingly evenly matched in the first round, they launched a volley of attacks at eachother but at the time mark, a less than 8% difference in HP leaned in Steel Blade&#39;s favor. Despite Conan&#39;s relentless Belly Attacks in the second round, the KO-ing victory went to Steel Blade. A surprising turn of events in the third round as Conan Pressed his way through the match and won the round by a surprisingly small 9.6%. Already on fire, Conan blazed his way to a KO vitory in the fourth round with an Earthquake and a Body Press. The final round here, both monsters put up a good fight. Conan tried to Earthquake and Roll his way through this one, but with a 999 sharp damaging Rolling Slash, Steel Blade won the fifth round, and the match. <BR> <BR><B>ROUND FIVE</B> <BR> <BR>First up were HCI Acid and Conan, and Acid was once again up to his old napping ways, fully sleeping off damage done by Conan&#39;s Earthquake. Unfortunatley Conan couldn&#39;t shake off the damage done by Acid&#39;s Diving Press, and at the end, a 16.6% difference leaned in Acid&#39;s favor. Conan really fired this round up with a 752 sharp damaging Earthquake, but after a few Charges were laid, Acid took the time to sleep it off. Conan performed an amazing 999 sharp damaging Roll Assault WITH POWER and KO&#39;ed Acid. The third round proved to be a humerous one, with Conan attempting a Tidal Wave, inflicting a whopping 9 damage. The rest of the round followed in the footsteps of the first, with Acid landing the win. The fourth and final round saw a 15% difference for Acid, and the winner was HCI Acid, 3/1.  <BR> <BR>Steel Blade vs. Evil Eye: Nothing too excting in the first round, Steel Blade managed to KO Evil Eye with a Twister Slash. The second round proved a very exciting &#40;yet very short&#41; one. Evil Eye launched a Turn Assault, and Steel Blade responded with a Ko-ing Deathbringer. Round three set it in stone for Steel Blade, as he returned with another Deathbringer and overkill Ko-ed Evil Eye. The winner here: Steel Blade 3/0  <BR> <BR>The Final Match <BR>Car Lie Al vs. Kund Poa was an intense match. Carl opened it up with a weak Knocking Up, then reedeemed himself with a hard hitting Earthquake. Kung Poa launched some minor attacks, Carl powers up, and at the rounds end, Kung Poa was the victor. In the second round Carl evened things out a bit, summoning a mighty 608 sharp damaging Earthquake. Kung Poa retaliated with a good tonguing and a charge, but Carl stomped him out with another Earthquake, winning the round with a KO. Round three began fast with two surprise Diving Presses from Kung Poa. Carl Powers up, and then down, to launch a Knocking Up. Kung Poa responded with a  KO-ing Tongue Slap. Carl is down but not out and gets up once more with GRIT. Carl scratches a measly 108 damage and then the time is up. 0.1% vs 72.6%: Kung Poa wins 2/1. The next round was the one we were all waitng for, the fourth round. Carl wastes his time uselessly Powering up, and launches a lame 135 damaging Knocking Up. Kung Poa, on the other hand uses Diving Press and Charge. Lisa encouraged Carl from the distance of the Chat Room : &#34;Carl! You need to Earthquake!&#34; Carl instead choose to go Wave Riding and inflicts 719 sharp damage. Kung Poa Powers up and performs another Diving Press. Carl, by sheer will, again gets Grit!, but too late because the round was up. 0.1% vs. 14.5%, King Poa won 3/1. <BR> <BR>The winner of the Tank Tournament was Kung Poa, but all the monsters put up a good fight.

 Oops, I&#39;d like to apologize for calling Kung Pao, the winner of the Tank War, Kung Poa repeatedly, and for calling it Kund Poa once.

 umm, that would probably be because I kept calling him HCI Acid.....because I thought those were all caps.  That was the PAL entry, so I raised it, and actually named it HCI Acid.  Oops, I never even stopped to think about the name. <BR> <BR>Plans are on the way to making Tank War our tournament project, not just a one time thing.  So those of you who missed out on it the first time, you&#39;ll get more chances.
