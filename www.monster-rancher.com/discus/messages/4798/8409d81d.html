Spinach, trained by ShadowFusion, won a dramatic victory in the Hengar Challenge on Sunday night.  It was probably the best Mayor&#39;s Cup ever...it certainly was the most competitive.  Well, the first and last matches were great - although there were some predictable slaughters in between. <BR> <BR>SS Wins v Marklin - Marklin came out with a full head of steam, and KO&#39;d SS quickly twice in a row.  In the third match, SS evaded Marklin&#39;s giga blade, and fired its ion cannon - causing a 999 damage KO!  The momentum had shifted, and SS followed up with a come-from-behind KO fueled by back-to-back force bombers.  In the crucial 5th match, SS took a commanding lead only to see it crumble in the last 3 seconds when Marklin landed a 468 point core attack to win 22% to 10%. <B>Marklin 3, SS Wins 2</B> <BR> <BR>Then came several matches where the winner clearly overmatched the loser.  <B>SirOck 3, SS Wins 0</B>, 2 by KO; <B>Spinach 3, SS Wins 0</B>, all by KO; <B>Spinach 3, Marklin 0</B>, 2 by KO.   <BR> <BR>Only the Marklin v SirOck match had any suspense.  SirOck started with 2 KO&#39;s, but then Marklin sacked up and connected with 2 mega blades and a remote punch, while dodging all but one of SirOck&#39;s attacks, to gain a clear victory.  Alas, 2 force bombers and a giga shooter meant a final KO in round 4...<B>SirOck 3, Marklin 1</B> <BR> <BR>The Grand Finale, for once, lived up to its billing.  These were two very evenly matched monsters.  Each landed two blows in round one - Spinach&#39;s, helped by Flame Secrets, were just a hair stronger, allowing a 1% victory.  The same thing happened in round 2, except a missed ion cannon allowed SirOck a temporary guts advantage, which he turned into a 4% edge.  Round 3 saw SirOck complete 3 giga shooters, allowing him to squelch any comeback by Spinach until it was too late.  But the 2-1 lead evaporated, as the pattern of &#34;2 blows apiece, with Spinach&#39;s being stronger&#34; repeated again in round 4.  Round 5 was as tense as it could be.  After each hengar had a tech blocked by the other, Spinach hit a 201 remote punch, which SirOck reponded to by dealing out back to back giga shooter and force bomber.  SirOck maintained the lead into the final seconds, when a giga shooter by Spinach gave him a slim edge which gave him the victory!  <B>Spinach 3, SirOck 2</B> <BR> <BR>Best tourney I&#39;ve been part of in quite a while!  Let&#39;s do it again with Mews in August, and Lesiones in October!

 Don&#39;t forget when Spinach also scored a 999 hit against Marklin. Also Marklin came very close to KOing Spinach at one point, but Spinach ended up KOing Marklin.
