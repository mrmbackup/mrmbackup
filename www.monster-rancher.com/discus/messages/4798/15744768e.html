 Just because I&#39;ve been reading the discussion about  <BR>the 3,000 point MR2 tourney lately and I think that  <BR>a  <BR>PS3 tournament would be the easiest thing to  <BR>organise imaginable, I was just wondering how many  <BR>people play  <BR>on PS3? I guess the only downside is that as far as  <BR>I&#39;m aware sending saves between PS3 files and  <BR>anything  <BR>else is impossible. :&#124;

 How would you plan on holding/broadcasting the tournament if theoretically it was possible?

 Holding would be easy enough, just use a USB  <BR>memory stick to transfer the file/s to your  <BR>computer and then email them, then reverse the  <BR>process at the other side. I&#39;m not certain how  <BR>EU/NA would work though, that might not be  <BR>possible. Broadcasting would be more of a problem,  <BR>I have a camera but you always get those black  <BR>lines flickering on a regular recording of a TV, I   <BR>could try using a DVD recorder, &#40;no idea if this  <BR>is the general name or just what I call it&#41; it&#39;s a  <BR>definite possibility. <BR> <BR>Also, if anyone knows how to drag the box out to  <BR>full width on a tablet I&#39;d appreciate it.

 Could you get one of your save files onto your PS3 and tell me the file type please?

 It&#39;s a PSV file, no idea if that&#39;s unique or not.

 Keep me posted on how this goes. I haven&#39;t played in a while but if there were regular tournies, I would totally change that.

 I&#39;ve got exams until the 28th currently but we&#39;ll  <BR>be trying out getting regular PS1 saves working  <BR>and the recording sometime over the next week  <BR>hopefully.

 We know for a fact that PAL and NTSC saves are not compatible with each other for MR2, both by testing emailed saves and snail-mailed memory cards. &#40;also, the Japanese NTSC version saves don&#39;t work with the North American ones, either.&#41;  <BR> <BR>The game was re-coded for the EU zone, remember, it&#39;s not written for the PSX OS, it&#39;s written in machine code, so all of the hardware display differences are hard coded in the game. &#40;MF2 was one of the games that would not play on the original PS2-JP because it wasn&#39;t written to run on the PSX-OS&#41;

 We will be posting an update this weekend. <BR> <BR>To start: <BR> <BR>3000 stat total, no other restrictions. <BR> <BR>Monsters will have identical guts rate, so choose your desired mains/subs. <BR> <BR>Start training!

 &#34;will have identical guts rate&#34;  <BR> <BR>This means that the monsters will be manipulated, and that you&#39;re not using anything like real saves at all. You&#39;re trying to remake the game into something else. &#40;something easier, with less strategy&#41; We won&#39;t endorse such an event. <BR> <BR>Messages about this will be deleted within 24 hours.

 I can&#39;t really agree with the reasoning behind that, we&#39;re simply trying to open up a wider range of  <BR>monsters so that people can pick their favourites, as things currently are a zilla will simply lose to a  <BR>ghost time and time again and I wouldn&#39;t regard &#34;Pick monster with fast guts&#34; as being complex strategy.  <BR>The battling&#39;s all computer controlled so there&#39;s no strategy there either; the only thing this would change  <BR>would be that certain monsters with damage efficient techs would be held in more regard, but selecting  <BR>these techs and having a monster know few enough undesirable ones to have a decent chance of using it is  <BR>something I feel would take more consideration than looking at regen rates.  <BR> <BR>I also don&#39;t understand the comment about not using real saves, the reason I opened this thread in the  <BR>first place was that sending files between PS3s would be far simpler than any other means as far as I&#39;m  <BR>aware. This would allow me to easily verify that someone had actually raised a monster and then it could  <BR>be recreated identically except for a modified guts regen value. I wouldn&#39;t restrict the proof to just  <BR>this, I think any kind of picture evidence would be good enough for an entry, but that was my initial  <BR>idea anyway. <BR> <BR>I can understand that the debate about sharking something in is entirely opinion based, between person to  <BR>person some may consider a Beaclon with a guts regen of 10 usable whilst another may think it simplifies  <BR>the game, but to be honest I think that raising interest for this can&#39;t do any harm. I respect that this  <BR>isn&#39;t your thing but this is why we came up with our own ideas rather than posting them in the  <BR>existing 3,000 composite tourney thread. Nothing we&#39;ve done is outside the rules, and it&#39;s even precisely  <BR>what Fenrick recommended we do in the other thread, I&#39;ve accepted host responsibility, and he clearly  <BR>stated &#34;You can use the MRM forum and MRM facebook page to advertise and ask for ranchers to compete and  <BR>post your rules, competitors, brackets, wins/losses, etc. &#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not asking you to like our rules but in short, I don&#39;t see what harm letting us advertise here or at  <BR>least on the facebook page can do you.

You originally posted that your event would allow different stats for differing guts rates. <BR> <BR>You took it upon yourself to announce an event that was not agreed upon.  <BR> <BR>Last time I checked, I was the site&#39;s sole owner. And, I pay cash out of my own pocket to run it. Fenrick is a Moderator, but, he doesn&#39;t have final say on anything here. <BR> <BR><I>&#34;Nothing we&#39;ve done is outside the rules&#34;</I> This is just a flat-out lie. Here&#39;s a quote from the rules: <BR> <BR><B>5&#41; Entering monsters which have been altered by use of a cheat device such as a gameshark or action replay, or other alteration methods is prohibited in all tournaments. Tournament hosts share the names of people entering hacked monsters, and post them publicly as well. Cheating in a tourney may result in you never being able to enter any tourney ever again, as well as other sanctions at MRM, including but not limited to: <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42; No one who has entered a hacked monster into a tourney will be granted a MRM posting account, and if they already have an existing account, it will be removed.</FONT> <BR> <BR>6&#41; All saves must be from legitimate console save files. We do not accept entries from anyone playing the game on emulators.</B> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t like liars. I especially don&#39;t like liars who try to convince me, on my own site, with my own money, that I am the one who isn&#39;t telling the truth. <BR> <BR>Thread is locked. Subject is done and over with. <BR> <BR> I know that you want to strip the monsters down to simplistic caricatures so that you can try to play your imaginary version of a Pokemon game with them. We aren&#39;t participating. <BR> <BR>One more word about this, and at least two of you will lose your accounts.
