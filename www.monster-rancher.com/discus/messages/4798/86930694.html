What a night.  What a battle.  Wins and losses were decided by the narrowest of margins, not only in the individual battles, but in each match, and, indeed, in the bracket as a whole.  When the smoke cleared from the arena of combat, Flo was standing triumphant - having been tested severely, and yet winning convincingly.  Here&#39;s the details: <BR> <BR>First Match:  <B>Freddy B. vs Spinach</B> - Spinach started the first battle with a 214 remote punch, then seemingly decided to rest on his leafy laurels.  Bad decision - 3 spin knuckles later, Freddy had a 1-0 lead.  Spinach unleashed, and connected on all its techs in the 2d and 3d, and Freddy&#39;s eagle rushes were not enough to keep up,  <BR>giving Spinach the lead again.  2 remote punches by the green machine were overcome by a last minute critical eagle rush, and it was 2-2.  The monsters missed most of their techs in the deciding 5th, with a 232 remote punch finally outpointing a 126 eagle rush.  <B>Spinach 3, Freddy 2</B> <BR> <BR>Second Match: <B>Kitty v Flo</B> - The mew civil war was a lot more violent than the first match.  Kitty opened the first battle with a 266 zap, but flo retaliated with a 534 cat fan, a 430 10:10 and &#91;after a 218 cat fool by Kitty&#93; a 301 cat fan for the KO.  Kitty roared back with a 336 zap, 228 cat fool and a 409 crit zap which left Flo reeling and tied the score at 1-1.  In the next two battles, however, Flo connected with 739 and 740 crit 10:10&#39;s, respectively, to leave the bambiimew in a heap on the floor.  <B>Flo 3, Kitty 1</B>. <BR> <BR>Third Match: <B>Kitty v Freddy B.</B> - 2 220-ish cat fools gave Kitty the lead, but a last minute crit eagle rush gave Freddy the first battle.  The Hawaiians came out for the second battle, and, together with the fools, left Freddy hopelessly befuddled - tie match.  Freddy blocked the spiral hulas in the 3d, but a 377 cat fan led to a narrow points victory for Miss Kitty in the 3d; a 323 crit spin knuckle reversed that pattern in the 4th, making it 2-2.  Freddy began the crucial 5th missing two spin knuckles in a row, and Kitty took full advantage, hitting fan, fool and hawaiian for an domineering final win.  <B>Kitty 3, Freddy B. 2</B> <BR> <BR>Fourth Match: <B>Freddy v Flo</B>  - By now the thinking was, get Freddy&#39;s matches over with and move on to the real battles.  The sweaty penguin had other plans, however.  A last minute 431 crit spin knuckle gave Freddy the first battle, and Flo missed all her techs in the second, allowing Freddy&#39;s 3 eagle rushes to lead to a 2-0 lead.  Seconds from a humiliating sweep, Flo managed to salvage her dignity with a 512 crit cat fan, making it 2-1, but her glee was short-lived...3 big time spin knuckles outpointed her 10:10 and zap, giving Freddy the upset of the day. <B>Freddy 3, Flo 1</B> <BR> <BR>Fifth Match:  <B>Spinach v Flo</B> - Spinach landed an early giga shooter, but Flo fought back hard with a 268 meow and a 294 zap to take the first battle.  She began the 2d with a zap, but Spinach landed the best 1-2 of the night: 426 remote punch immediately followed by a 580 ion cannon for the KO, tieing the match.  Spin took a 2-1 lead on points, with remote punch and giga shooter outpointing meow, and held a clinching lead in the 4th after a 237 force bomber and a bunch of misses by Flo.  But the gritty kitty landed a late 427 zap to force a crucial 5th battle.  Both monsters continued to miss for the first 3/4 of the final battle.  Flo hit 311 meow, which proved better than Spinach&#39;s final remote punch.  <B>Flo 3, Spinach 2</B> <BR> <BR>Sixth Match: <B>Kitty v Spinach</B>  So these monsters battled, with the winner guaranteed a tie with Flo, and the loser getting to keep Freddy company in losersville.  Kitty came out of the gate strong, with Hawaiian and cat fool outpointing giga sbhooter for a 1-0 lead.  But Spinach hit a 599 ion cannon in the 2d, and a 584 ion cannon in the 3d, and Kitty could never recover in either, despite a collection of fools and Hawaiians, making it 2-1.  Kitty smartly blocked the ion cannon in the 4th, and followed up by hitting all of her techs - Hawaiian twice - to blitz the humble hengar and tie the match.  However, Kitty&#39;s accuracy deserted her in the crucial 5th, missing 4 out of 5 techs, while Spinach connected with a remote punch and a force bomber, sealing the victory. <B>Spinach 3, Kitty 2</B> <BR> <BR>Tiebreaker:  After the evening of squeakers, and in light of their ultra-close regular session match, it was shocking to see Flo completely dominate Spinach in the Tiebreaker Round.  1st battle - 461 crit zap outpointed 236 remote punch.  2d battle - 600 crit 10:10 crossed the machine&#39;s circuitry.  3d battle - 489 crit 10:10 was better than 302 remote punch.  <B>Flo 3, Spinach 0</B> <BR> <BR>So Flo and the D rule all - Flo is indeed a brute, and will be a handful for Pokylyps and whoever wins the other brackets in the finals.  But every monster here - even my maligned Freddy - was a worthy entrant.  This was an incredibly tough bracket, and a very entertaining and tense battle all the way through to the anticlimactic ending.  Let&#39;s do it again soon!

 Sounds like it was a great fight! <BR> <BR>I apologize to everyone, especially torey, for not being at the fight yesterday.  My mom has recently come back from a long trip to Europe, and she really wanted to go and have a nice dinner, which regrettably meant I got home kind of late. <BR> <BR>I will definately be here for the next tournament, again my apologies.
