 Do the tournaments work, and what MR games are used for them? I only have MR2 and the GBA games... =/

 There&#39;s no computer control of both monsters in the GBA games, so tourneys are impossible in those games. <BR> <BR>The last few MR2 events were cancelled a couple of years ago due to a lack of entries. <BR> <BR>We&#39;ve got an MR1 event coming up, but, so far, I have two people&#39;s entries and there doesn&#39;t seem to be much interest. No one has replied to my inquiries about whether the dates and times I have available to hold the event are ok.

 I recently found my dex drive and am very tempted to try an entry myself &#40;if I could find my game cds&#41;.  However, the bad thing about MR1 is that you can&#39;t generate a monster from your book &#40;an issue I was SO happy to see fixed with MRA&#41;.  I no longer have the bulk of my CD collection. :&#40;  Maybe I will look over the tournamet parameters again and see.  &#40;doubtful that I have the time, but maybe...&#41;  I never was a top notch MR1 player, but I had an Angel that was really good.

 She has beaten the big 4, but her total stat range is only about 2500-3000 tops.  I don&#39;t think any of her stats are even in the 900 range.  I&#39;ll have to take a better look if I can find the rest of my old equipment.  I am on vacation during thanksgiving week and may be able to take one whole day to make a good monster for use as an Uke for the other entrants. :P <BR> <BR>  I know exactly what CD made that Angel and I know I do still have it.  I may be able to do this..

 It would be nice to see another entry, and, while I am keeping my monster&#39;s breed a secret, I will say that it is not an Angel.

 Ok, I got the stuff.  I think that I can take this monster and use a combination of the Shock treatment and the Vitamin overload to get her up to snuff.  It beats starting over since she already has all of her techs and is way past her prime.  She was pretty much my first monster and I am fairly certain I peached her.  She is already 6 years old.  If I dump all of my money into her, run my cash cow for a while, then give her the shock treatment for her last few stats, then I think she will be good to go.

 Ok, so I have given her the shock treatment for her INT since there are no pills for INT and she only needed about 100 to max it out.  I have been doing the item overload for her other stats, which costs a ridiculous amount of money, but works.  But given the effect of pills on the monster&#39;s life span, I imagine that if I do anything with her right now, she&#39;ll die since she was already at at 5Y10M to start with.  She is now 6Y4M.  &#40;It occurred to me that I had to do the Shock treatment first since I would have no lifespan after the pill overdose...  Silly me didn&#39;t realize it until after my first round of meds, though, and I had to start over...&#41;   <BR> <BR>I have some more pill-popping to go, but I believe I have enough money to make it work. I have about 120000 left.

 Heh, I stopped to see what would happen if I rested her.  She died instantly..
