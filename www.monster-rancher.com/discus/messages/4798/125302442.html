 I&#39;ve gotten confirmation that the disc you place inside the PS2 for using SP/XP is not compatible with the new slim PS2. I am working on getting word about Max Drive compatibility.

 Hey D! The MR3 Master&#39;s event got postponed, I hope you can attend when it finally does happen! <BR> <BR>This Slim PS2 issue may not be so bad if the Max Drive is compatible with it. Right now, the bigger issue we are facing is the whole thing with Hotmail viewing saves as viruses...

 The Hotmail problem can be gotten around by using other email addresses. Currently we need to run some tests to see if gmail woarks. I do have some invites, if it works I can set you up with a gmail account. &#40;My ISP&#39;s email works also, but that&#39;s a last resort.&#41;

 yahoo is an option, seeing as it&#39;s more available than gmail &#40;gmail is still in the beta stage, no?&#41;... <BR>question: can you still send sp/xp saves, or is the only problem recieving them?

 Hotmail does not allow them to be sent, as well as not allowing them to be opened once they are in an inbox. I sent half a dozen tests out of my real email box because hotmail wouldn&#39;t not let me send them. My real email worked fine, but it&#39;s already overflowing with real world stuff. This was when we discovered that the shaw.ca cable service also does not allow them to be sent or received. <BR> <BR>If a couple people with yahoo boxes want to test this that would be great. I also need to test my gmail. My gmail address is: <BR> monster.rancher.metropolis &#40;at&#41; gmail.com <BR>&#40;replace the &#40;at&#41; with @ and get rid of the spaces -and yes, gmail uses dots instead of dashes, keep the periods&#41; <BR> <BR>You can send me any sort of .sps or .xps or max drive save. Just write &#39;test&#39; in the text of the message &#40;give it some sort of subject so it isn&#39;t filtered as junk, &#34;Lisa here is your copy&#34;&#41; and I will know and delete the save if it arrives safely.

 Why dont you Winzip them. <BR>Im pretty sure hotmail doesnt count those as viruses, so you just have to unzip them at the destination.

 Great i just read the other topic, making my above post obsolete. <BR> <BR>Just a theory again: <BR>Rename the end of the files, like if you want to send picture.jpg, rename it picture.xyz <BR>then when you want to use it, just change it back to jpg and it should work again. <BR> <BR>Thats how most people hide nude pictures etc.

 You can send me an .sps sharkport save. &#40;If I don&#39;t need to upload it onto my memory card or anything, then I think I can get max drive ans .xps saves too, right?&#41; Just write &#39;test&#39; in the text of the message as well as the subject.  <BR>Anyways, my e-mail is. <BR> <BR>THE_KING952952@ yahoo.com <BR> <BR>Delete the space after @

 The e-mail was in my inbox. I clicked &#34;Scan and Download File&#34; &#40;or something to that effect&#41; and saved it on to my desktop. Everything was fine so I deleted the file since I do not have MR3, so there was no real way of &#34;testing&#34; it. <BR> <BR>Short version: Yahoo is a go.

 Lisa, why not just email the files to yourself. That way you don&#39;t need to relay between people, plus you obviously have a sharkport so you can test it yourself.

 Because, as I stated before, some ISP emails are seeing the files as viruses &#40;shaw in canada for one&#41;, and I figured that some people might want to test their ISP or other email services that I personally don&#39;t have. I don&#39;t have a Yahoo email, and there are dozens of freemail providers out there, all over the globe. There are dozens of US ISPs. I don&#39;t live in the right geographical area to have access to Roadrunner and the like, and I can&#39;t afford to join AOL, PeoplePC Online, Netscape, Netzero, etc. just for this test.

 I beg to differ regarding the slim PS2&#39;s lack of compatibility with the X-Port. I tried it myself a day or so ago, and it worked just fine. As for the SharkPort, I haven&#39;t the foggiest, as I lack one. <BR> <BR>Oh, if you&#39;re interested, we have a special X-Port/Max Drive save converter available for download at the RPG Maker community main site, The RPG Maker Pavilion.

 I have seen the converter, I just haven&#39;t had the time to test it myself. I would appreciate anyone submitting saves converting them to .max for me. I hate the sp/xp.  <BR> <BR>As for the incompatibilty, I went and asked at several forums, including the gameshark site and Datel&#39;s tech support &#40;after reading several topics at gamefaqs where users complained&#41;, and everyone said they didn&#39;t work, that the slim ps2 wouldn&#39;t read the ps2 disc.

 Perhaps mine worked fine due to the fact that mine is a slightly older model. Ah, no use looking a gift horse in the mouth.
