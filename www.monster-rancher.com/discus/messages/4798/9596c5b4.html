<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:toreyluvullo@hotmail.com>torey luvullo</A></B> on <B>Monday, December 16, 2002 - 06:50 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
The big night finally arrived!  All the champions of the MR3 Mayors Cups gathered in one arena to determine the winner of the Champions Cup on Sunday Night.  Surprises were in store! <BR> <BR>It was first decided that RedRanjr&#39;s fights would occur offstage.  Yet even the zany zan would make an appearance by the end of the night... <BR> <BR>The monsters were aligned in composite stat order from lowest to highest, and then assigned to fight all their battles, for easiest operation by the mayor and tourney host, Lisa Shock.  That meant Halo went first. <BR> <BR><B>Halo v Freddy B</B> Freddy started out fast, spin knuckling his way to an easy victory in the first match.  Halo roared back with a star gather, a fairy dust, and a heapin helpin of raycasts, to even the fight at 1-1.  Then Freddy battered the poor pixie the next two matches to win 3-1. <BR> <BR><B>Halo v Patsy</B> Halo came out for revenge, and took a 2-0 lead on a variety of mystical, starlit techs.  Two tsunamis later, and the leapin lesi had narrowed it to 2-1.  the fourth match was a defensive affair, won by a tail whip by the lesione.  In the crucial 5th match, Patsy led off with a tsunami, but then watched passively as the plucky pixie came back with several fairy dusts to narrow the gap.  At the last moment, Halo launched a tech...but only a raycast, and only 52 damage.  by the tiniest of percentage points, Patsy eked out a comeback victory, 3-2. <BR> <BR><B>Halo v Flo</B> In the first match, Halo led off with a 249 star gather...and was hit by a 999 KO 10:10 at the 53 second mark!  The second match was also won, this time on points, by the muscular mew, on the strength of a 493 cat fan.  Halo rallied briefly for a shutout win in the third match, but was KO&#39;d by a combination of zaps and meows in the 4th, as Flo won 3-1. <BR> <BR><B>Halo v Spinach</B>  The green guy took his turn at &#34;pixie KO&#34; by using remote punch and giga shooters to take a 1-0 lead.  The next two matches ion cannon was featured, much to Halo&#39;s dismay, as Spinach became the only monster to accomplish a 3-0 sweep. <BR> <BR>Next up was Freddy B. <BR> <BR><B>Freddy B v Patsy</B> The first match had 7 misses and only one hit - an eagle rush for Freddy.  Tail whips evened the fight up for Patsy in the second match, and she was on the verge of taking a 2-1 lead when, with seconds left, Freddy unleashed a 400 crit spin knuckle to take the lead himself.  Undaunted, the loopy lesi launched tail whip and tsunami to retie the fight.  In the crucial 5th match, the rollicking raiden hit two spin knuckles early, and Patsy just kept missing, allowing Freddy to escape with a 3-2 win. <BR> <BR><B>Freddy B v Flo</B> This battle started with 8 misses, until Freddy hit a last second spin knuckle for a 1-0 lead.  Flo stormed back with a 251 cat fan, but missed the rest of her tries, while Freddy connected with a pair of spin knuckles to take a 2-0 lead.  Boom!  2 10:10&#39;s later, with Freddy lying KO&#39;d on the ground, it was 2-1.  But in the 4th, Freddy&#39;s spin knuckle outpointed Flo&#39;s cat fan in another miss filled extravaganza, and Freddy was a 3-1 winner. <BR> <BR><B>Freddy B v Spinach</B> Freddy took a big lead with spin knuckle and eagle rush, and withstood the heroic henger&#39;s 2 giga shooters to take a 1-0 lead.  This pattern repeated itself in the second match, except it was a force bomber and a giga shooter that Freddy outpointed to make it 2-0.  His metallic back to the wall, Spinach resorted to his best tech, remote punch, and never looked back, edging closer at 2-1.  But that was the robot&#39;s last hurrah, as Freddy shut him out in the 4th, landing a couple of spin knuckles to win 3-1. <BR> <BR>At this point, Freddy was undefeated and assured of winning the entire tourney.  However, the silver and bronze remained to be awarded, so the tourney next focused on Patsy. <BR> <BR><B>Patsy v Flo</B> A meow and a cat fan beats 2 tail whips and a lesihorne; Flo led 1-0.  Flo turned up the heat, using a crit zap, a 10:10 and a cat fan to bring the luckless lesi to within 4 points of KO-ville...2-0 Flo.  By this time Flo was toying with Patsy, and a single 10:10 was enough to complete the sweep.  3-0 Flo. <BR> <BR><B>Patsy v Spinach</B> Patsy&#39;s 3 tail whips outpointed Spinach&#39;s giga shooter and force bomber in match 1.  A slugfest erupted in match 2 - Patsy hit with a 507 tsunami and a 228 tail whip, and still lost due to 3 remote punches landed by Spinach, who then won match 3 on the strength of 3 giga shooters to take a 2-1 lead.  The green guy then dominated the final match, shutting out Patsy until a final pathetic lesihorne at least salvaged some of her dignity, but not the victory...3-1 Spinach. <BR> <BR><B>Spinach v Flo</B> was the final match of the evening.  Flo went into KO mode.  In match 1, she used 2 10:10&#39;s and a zap to unplug the machine.  Then, she followed up with a crit 10:10, and 2 meows to deactivate the systems of the hapless henger.  Spinach recharged enough to ride an ion cannon to a 3d match victory, but Flo the KO-er reemerged, this time choosing2 zaps and a 10:10 to finish off Spinach, and win 3-1. <BR> <BR>At this point, yours truly, intoxicated with victory and guinness &#91;not in that order&#93; wrongly reported that there was a 3 way tie for 2d, giving Patsy a credit for a victory she hadn&#39;t earned.  The actual standings are: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Record </TD></TR><TR><TD>FreddyB</TD><TD>4-0 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Flo</TD><TD>3-1 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Spinach</TD><TD>2-2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Patsy</TD><TD>1-3 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Halo</TD><TD>0-4</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>the crosshatch: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>--</TD><TD>Halo</TD><TD>Freddy</TD><TD>Patsy</TD><TD>Spinach</TD><TD>Flo </TD></TR><TR><TD>Halo</TD><TD>--</TD><TD><FONT COLOR="0000ff">X</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="0000ff">X</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="0000ff">X</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="0000ff">X</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Freddy</TD><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">O</FONT></TD><TD>--</TD><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">O</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">O</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">O</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Patsy</TD><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">O</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="0000ff">X</FONT></TD><TD>--</TD><TD><FONT COLOR="0000ff">X</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="0000ff">X</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Spinach</TD><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">O</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="0000ff">X</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">O</FONT></TD><TD>--</TD><TD><FONT COLOR="0000ff">X</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Flo</TD><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">O</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="0000ff">X</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">O</FONT></TD><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">O</FONT></TD><TD>--</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>nonetheless, foolishly relying on the false info, the tourney went to tiebreaker, and Red Ranjr - who was relaxing with a pina colada backstage, thinking he was not going to be foisted upon the stage - was drafted into duty.
