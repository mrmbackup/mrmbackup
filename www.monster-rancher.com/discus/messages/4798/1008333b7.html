There&#39;s been a couple of things that have come up concerning Hellraiser83 and Bait. <BR>While there&#39;s nothing that can be done for bait in the S Class.. here are several thoughts on the Market Monster Challenge &#40;the other tournament Bait qualified for&#41;. <BR> <BR>Suggestions: <BR><B>1: Do Nothing:</B> Let HR83&#39;s monster, Bait, continue to compete in the Market Monster Challenge wether he wins or loses.. it&#39;s good competition <BR><B>2: &#34;Freeze&#34; Bait:</B> Take him out of Market Monster Challenge for now and allow another trainer to compete in that bracket.. and take bait &#34;out of the freezer to compete again &#40;if any brackets are left&#41; if HR83 returns <BR><B>3: &#34;Forfeit&#34; Bait:</B> Leave current bracket as is, and forfeit Bait &#40;Losses for all fights&#41; and the remaining 3 monsters will bout it out for a place in the finale. <BR> <BR>Please give me your opinions. <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">I may do nothing at all</FONT> but I am just curious how other people feel since this subject did get addressed to me several times.

 Considering that I&#39;m one of the people up against Bait, I&#39;d be horribly biased, no matter what I said. I&#39;d probably best sit back and let other people hack this one out.

 from the standpoint of a supporter of tourneys: <BR> <BR>&#91;1&#93; it is good that new people are entering monsters in tourneys. <BR> <BR>&#91;2&#93; it is good that tourney monsters are unusually strong. <BR> <BR>&#91;3&#93; it will be good to see bait v jabba. <BR> <BR>&#91;4&#93; it is not good if new trainers, unaccustomed to how strong tourney monsters have to be, grow discouraged at having to send monsters who have no chance against the peak monsters of experienced trainers. <BR> <BR>one possible solution - there is another bracket coming up in this tourney, right?  leave the current bracket as is.  then offer a &#34;one time only&#34; special dispensation - the trainers who had to face bait can re-enter their monsters in the next bracket, if they feel that they were put up against it in having to face bait.  of course, since they would have to face bait &#91;and jabba&#93; in the finals anyway, the trainers would of course be free to submit better monsters into the next bracket instead. <BR> <BR>i want to see how wal-mart does too - i am guessing it will do better than loyal, but still not win.  but i have learned that my guesses about how tourneys will unfold are not always right.

 Hellraiser&#39;s monsters always have weaknesses.  You just have to look them over and then smash &#39;em down. <BR> <BR>I wish I hadn&#39;t gotten lazy with my mock when I had to vs. his metalner.

 A speedser with a lot of guts draining/high hitting techniques and 1 large attack would beat that arrowhead if it had &#34;similar&#34; stats. <BR> <BR>That Gaboo Velo trained is a beast though. O_O <BR> <BR>Getting monsters that strong in 4 1/2 years is quite an accomplishment.

 I&#39;m almost positive that Wal-Mart won&#39;t be able to handle Bait. I&#39;m hoping maybe to raise another Crab Saurian, though, to see if &#39;Mart&#39;s high stats were the result of incredible luck, or if my style really _does_ work that well for raising Market Monster stats. Heck, I might even post it. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I must admit: I want Wal-Mart to win so he can go against that gaboo. But barring that, I&#39;ve still got Turkey Chili waiting in the wings. And Velo has said that his monster would be more afraid of turkey chili than Wal-Mart. ;&#41;

 Well except for gogators, diablos, and kurasu entering it isn&#39;t much of anyone else... <BR> <BR>As much as I&#39;d say &#34;stats don&#39;t matter&#34; it wouldn&#39;t matter in the case of the zuum.  Wal-mart is Sonansu&#39;s techs with...Million Claws.  It could&#39;ve been worse with Diving Claw &#40;Spotosaurus!&#41;  I said it before in chat and I can say it again... <BR> <BR>Zuums suck =P &#40;In tourneys..&#41; <BR> <BR>Doesn&#39;t the Hare know smash and some good techs?  Looking at it again it does know back/rolling blow, the 2 smashes and the 2 bangs...well, it can certainly dish it out, but it won&#39;t take much to knock it out.  Hares can fight though. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know, I mean it&#39;s an Arrowhead after all...PURE.  I agree with mp about it though, it&#39;d easily be beaten by an antagonist.

 Well, thanks for the compliments on Jabba people. <BR> <BR>I would vote that Bait stays.  Although I admit that his trainer has probably lost interest in this, the fact that he made and submitted the monster should guarantee a spot no matter the circumstances.  Bait will, most likely, win the second bracket, but after that we have two more brackets to allow other players to make monsters using the most effective techniques, which can very well rival and defeat both Bait and Jabba if done right.  As long as nobody gives up, we can have a very exciting final round.

 OK.  Bait stays.. seems there are is a Mass of Pro Batiers more so than those against. <BR>and, I agree with Velo, HR did raise and submit a monster, he should be guaranteed his place regardless.  I will not ask this type of question again concerning a trainer of Yor who submitteed a qualifying monster.
