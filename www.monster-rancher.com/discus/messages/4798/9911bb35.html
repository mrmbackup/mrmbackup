 Last night two unofficial grudge matches were held between me and the decorous Torey Luvullo in the chatroom.  <BR> <BR>These grudges were between Lisaione and Patsy, and Pokylyps and Sofia. Both of those fights, I felt I had the better monster, but lost nonetheless. While Pokylyps did go on to win his bracket, that was not the case with Lisaione, so I felt a rematch was in order. <BR> <BR>Forgive me for any mistakes, as this is an unofficial match, its all from memory. <BR> <BR>Lordly Lisaione vs. Fatsy Patsy <BR> <BR>Round 1 had Lisaione getting her revenge with a strong tsunami and a submerge to win her the match. Round 2 Patsy managed to win with a tsunami of her own and a few well placed tail whips. Round 3 Patsy kept Lisaione&#39;s guts down with constant Lesihorne attacks, and a tail whip for the win. Round 4 had Patsy score an early tail whip hit, but was followed up by lots of Lesihornes, some that hit and some that missed. Lisaione got a tail whip in, but screwed up her chances of winning with a blocked tsunami with 10 seconds on the clock.  <BR> <BR>Patsy won, and is now the better lesione to me. 3-1 <BR> <BR>Pokylyps the Proud vs. Sofia the Suezo <BR> <BR>Slap and a Tornado Punch were all it took to win Pokylyps Round 1. But round 2 featured a 467 critical noise from the suezo, a well placed suezo beam, and licking action to show why the Suezo had won in their first meeting. I don&#39;t quite remember round 3, but I think it ended with an overkill olega meteor at the last few seconds, leaving the suezo smeared all over a crater. Round 4 Sofia took easily without suffering a scratch thanks to her great withering techniques and &#39;cause that girl can dance &#40;pokylyps missed a lot&#41;. Round 5 started off with an Olega Meteor or a Tornado Punch, I forget, but it was something unpleasant for Sofia. And to end the night, Pokylyps finished with a 767 damage critical Tornado Punch, effectively ending Sofia&#39;s career as a monster. <BR> <BR>Pokylyps won 3-2 <BR> <BR>Justice has been served

 i thought poky took it 3-1.  whatever - sofia is a born loser, and she surely did get lucky to beat poky the one time.  patsy has turned out to be a useful lesi, and i am glad she repeated.
