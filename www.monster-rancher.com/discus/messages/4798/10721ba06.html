 Man, all tank-types with one speedster... <BR> <BR>I had a trainer tell me once that, <BR> <BR>&#34;The best defense for an attack is to not be where it lands.&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going for Welcome, good job Red Hare, looks like a Master class Durahan in the making. Haven&#39;t seen one I liked since Ryger &#40;sp?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Either way, I think Welcome will take it.

 Unfortunately, the Disciple, is a pupil of Dur, and learned the many ways of losing.

 The first step is, of course, having terrible stats. 1 SPD AND Slim? Daaaamn. He doesn&#39;t really make up for it with the techs, low skill, and other stuff. C&#39;mon, Slappy, don&#39;t waste our time ^_^ Jus&#39; kidding... <BR> <BR>On to actual predictions: <BR> <BR>Disciple will amaze me if he wins one single battle, I kid you not. <BR> <BR>Powerhouse is head and shoulders above of anyone else in this bracket with the signature greatness of tech selection and stats associated with the HR ranch. He gets to win, but maybe not by a huge margin. <BR> <BR>Welcome has a chance to win thanks to the excellent Punch Combo, but that costs guts and he won&#39;t have many to spare &#40;not that anyone in this class will, actually&#41;. <BR> <BR>As for Suzearin, he&#39;ll get hit every time or just about and he has much worse tech and stat selection that his Durahan brother. He&#39;ll give the Gobi a run for the money in the same way Tampa Bay gives Detroit a good challenge. <BR> <BR>Oh, and it&#39;s weird to see that these are all HAD monsters. <BR> <BR>One more thing, Fen... I&#39;ve heard rumors that there&#39;d be no A5, is that true?

 Er, the slim was just a mis calculation of  life  left by me, i thought i had another month left, but it turns out i didnt. Also, i just wanted to see how a low skill monster would do in a tournament. I do have a shot at beating Suzerain, but the Ph and Welcome who willcontend for the finals, will destroy the Gobi

 It&#39;s a match between Welcome and ph, but the cyclone can still hit, not like it&#39;s gonna matter...could KO Welcome - not in one hit, I know that, but tough chance hitting. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going with the Durahan curse - he&#39;ll hit with million stabs, punch combos, and swings, while being hit by critical brow smash!!  I love that tech...too bad ph has so many techs with no Cyclone. =&#92;

 Beware the magic Suzerain, he&#39;ll win I tell you!!! J/K <BR> <BR>1st: Welcome, cuz it&#39;s the only monster with any speed <BR>2nd: Powerhouse. Really, I think it could go either way between him and Welcome, but again, the speed issue <BR>3rd: Well, just cuz I trained him he gets 3rd <BR>4th: The Disciple, cuz there&#39;s no one left <BR> <BR>Sure Suze&#39;s techs suck, I trained him way back when I had no idea what I was doing.

Out of the 2, I chose <B>Welcome</B>.  I love the speed, and he seems to have enough of the good techs that with a little tech selection, he can outpoint the slams of <B>Powerhouse</B>.  Any Durahan suckiness will immediately be pounced on by the BattleRocks, however, and even without cyclone, he has the techs he needs to punish his enemies - and even a little speed. <BR> <BR><B>Suzerain</B> has all the Durahan suckiness, and not enough of the techs.  <B>Disciple</B> has cyclone, but has no speed and gives up 16 lvl points to the top two. <BR> <BR>Good luck to all!
