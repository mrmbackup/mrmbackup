Yay!!  The day of the MR1 tournament has finally arrived!  I&#39;ve been hearing about them for awhile now, but I still wasn&#39;t ready for the fact that one of them is finally on the schedule.

If he doesn&#39;t, <B>Ultrimus</B> will be there to pick up the pieces.  He has strong worm techs, and good lif/def, so if he can hit the lazy ape, he will defeat him.

There will have to be some new MR1 dynamic at work for them to win, so I want to see at least one battle in action before setting their odds too low. <BR> <BR>This should be fun!

 I find it quite odd that i have the 2nd highest SPD at 51! But i have the power due to the fact that i have some powerr techs, but the INT techs work well. Now, i wont dodge and with horrible life i will probably only be able to survive a hit or two from the Ape and Worm. I would give me and the Black Rex, like torey, an Equal chance for 3rd in this tourney. Just Critiquing myself.

 This is a bracket full of tanks, so Bushwhack certainly has an advantage because of his speed. Here are my predictions: <BR> <BR>1. Bushwhack - He&#39;ll dodge most attacks with his max speed, but if he gets hit he might take a lot of damage due to his low defense. <BR> <BR>2. Ultrimus - He also has a good chance to win because of his max skill. His max defense and life will compensate for his level 0 speed. <BR> <BR>3. 51 Pesos - There is a chance for him to win, but his power techs &#43; low power and his low life might ruin it. <BR> <BR>4. Black Dino - This guy has the same stat structure as Ultrimus, but his lower defense and skill might be a problem against Bushwhack. Also, his lack of techs is a big problem. <BR> <BR>I guess thats it..

 i personally belive dinos are one of the best monsters in mr1 there like long lived hard working versions of nagas <BR>also they seem to have a will to win a ferocity and a kindoff blood lust that is only mached by naga they may not have the best techs but their techs fit them better then the naga

 your dino certainly showed some good ability, dk - i am sure there is much we have to learn about the comparative merits of the MR1 breeds in computer ai battles.

 As torey said, it seems we all have a lot of preconceptions of how MR1 monsters should be based on our experiences with the later games of the series. This attitude is clearly evident after seeing our first MR1 tournament. Suffice to say, a different approach is required for MR1. Whether that approach shows that Dinos are the king-of-the-ring monster is yet to be determined in my opinion. But yes, Black Dino did a lot better than I would have imagined.
