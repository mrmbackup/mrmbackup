These fights were fun, it was nice to see the weaker techs making a big diference in matches.  In the end however, the monster that won did so because of the effectiveness of it&#39;s favorite, powerful move. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Synister vs. Hundley</FONT>: The first match was rather close, Synister only lost because he missed a screw drive.  The next two matches however, would not far quite as well for the Naga, being nearly KO&#39;d twice and never even landing an attack in the third and final round. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Hundley wins 3-0</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Synister vs. Deadbaby</FONT>:  The match served as a preview for the rest of ther matches of the night.  In every round, Syn would land a moderately powerful tech on the golem only to be beaten back by the deadly tornado punch.  After being KO&#39;d twice in a row, it was no surprise when DB emerged from the third round victorious. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Deadbaby wins 3-0</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Boogie M vs. Synister</FONT>:  At first it seemed that the Joker had the upper hand, using it&#39;s deadly evil spirit attack to deplete Syn&#39;s health down.  However, for the first and only time of the night, Syn began to show a lot of fight.  In the second and third rounds he used powerful screw drive attacks to nearly KO the joker while managing to dodge most of his enemies attacks in turn.  Then, in the fourth round, the two monsters battled to the bitter end, and when the dust settled, Synister prevailed 46.2% to 36.7%. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Synister wins 3-1</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Boogie M vs. Hundley</FONT>:  The first round saw the Zoom KO&#39;d by Boogie&#39;s evil spirit and slash attacks, but after that things began to turn around.  Hundley unleashed a barrage of techs in round two, leaving Boogie with but a sliver of HP in the end.  He won again in the next round thanks to some dodging on his part, yet Boogie came back with a 45% margin win in the fourth round.  In the fifth and sudden death round, both monsters showed their valor, but in the end it was Boogie with his evil spirit attacks that was more powerful. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Boogie wins 3-2</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Boogie M vs. Deadbaby</FONT>:  This was hardly a fight.  Boogie pulled off a few evil spirits here and there, but yet again the tornado punches of Deadbaby were more than enough to send the joker into oblivion. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Deadbaby wins 3-0</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Deadbaby vs. Hundley</FONT>:  Of all the Deadbaby fights, this was perhaps the saddest.  Hundley was obviously trying his best to make his trainer proud, but even a critical fireball did only 44 damage.  Unsurprisingly, Deadbaby KO&#39;d Hundley three times in a row. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Deadbaby wins 3-0</FONT> <BR> <BR>That&#39;s it folks, all hail the magnificent Deadbaby and his trainer DeadBuffalo! <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Good night MRM!</FONT>

This was my way of saying &#34;Happy New Year&#34; to you all. I will say that I got Deadbaby after testing out about 10 other types of monsters in my own baby contest. Golem just came out on top &#40;and its easy to see why&#41;. Naga and Zoom&#40;the same techs hundley had&#41; were 2 of the monsters I knew were weaker than my golem. <BR>Strangely enough i didn&#39;t test Joker &#40;i didn&#39;t think its level 1 techs were good enough&#41;, and I think Boogie came the closest to a win. <BR>Anyway, hang around, this year looks like it could be interesting for MR3 tournaments. I also may have a few surprises this year. Its a great time to get involved too; all you need is a sharkport and a determination to win.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll see everyone at the Gitan cup. <BR>And <B>please</B>, don&#39;t forget about Legend Cup.
