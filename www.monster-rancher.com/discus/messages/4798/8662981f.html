<FONT COLOR="ff6000"><FONT SIZE="+2">Deadbuffalo&#39;s Divinations</FONT></FONT> <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to start with SS-Wins! from Slappy. I presume the name is satirical in nature. SS-Wins doesn&#39;t have much going for it. Its going to have to make up for a big difference in stat comp since not only does it already have the lowest stat comp in the bracket, but 548 points are in power. Thats about a 750 point weakness against The Blob. Then there is the issue of techs, 3 of which are long range, 1 medium range. Low life coupled with the lowest defense in the bracket probably will be enough though. No tarot cards are needed to see how well SS-Wins will do... <BR> <BR>Durahan51&#39;s The Blob has only gotten bigger since its unexpected defeat in A class. More polished in S class, The Blob looks like it will take this one easily. The Blob has by far the best stat comp for this particular bracket. The techs proved effective against pow monsters, and the magic 8 ball says they&#39;ll still be effective in this bracket. Hopefully we don&#39;t jinx it again ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Blair, my first ever made-for-tournament-monster, will lose. Maybe it&#39;ll beat SS-Wins, but even there i&#39;m skeptical. The techs just won&#39;t do enough damage. The two good things about Blair are a fast guts regain and that Flappe and Octopipi have some helpful battle effects.  I&#39;ve consulted the Voodoo lady; she said Blair will not be a finalist, but her master will make up for the shame she brings to his name. <BR> <BR>Enkidu, the legendary Blue Eyes White Dragon, from the equally legendary Torey Luvullo, is my second choice for the winner. The reason it isn&#39;t first is because I doubt we&#39;ll see more than 1 Inferno a match, if any. Its going to take a lot of Fires and Wing Storms to vanquish his opponents, but I think the Behemoth BEWD has a better sitution in this bracket then some of his opponents. The mirror on the wall says Enkidu is the finest of them all, but that mirror lies every now and then. <BR> <BR>Maybe next bracket will be all power based monsters. Since i&#39;m not going to be around, i root for Blair until she loses any chance of winning, and then for Enkidu. Snipe them Blair! Burn them Enkidu!

<CENTER><FONT COLOR="0000ff"><FONT SIZE="+2">MORNING LINE: MR3 S CLASS 9/16</FONT></FONT></CENTER> <BR> <BR>This is a unique MR3 tourney...for the first time, we have 4 monsters of different breeds - all of them specializing in int attacks.  I will have to differ from the esteemed deadbuffalo - most painfully, as to my own chances: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Breed</TD><TD>Trainer</TD><TD>Odds </TD></TR><TR><TD>TheBlob</TD><TD>Kuluro</TD><TD>Durahan51</TD><TD>9-5 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Blair</TD><TD>Yuppee</TD><TD>Deadbuffalo</TD><TD>2-1 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Enkidu</TD><TD>BEWD</TD><TD>ToreyLuvullo</TD><TD>5-2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>SS Wins</TD><TD>Henger</TD><TD>Slapshot</TD><TD>8-1</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>I see this as a 3-monster melee.  I backed <B>The Blob</B> when he was a little A class guy, and now that he has bulked up, I see no reason to abandon him - despite the loss to Marklin.  His chars are still the best here; his stat distribution is top-notch.  Only an over-reliance on hypnosis could lead to his downfall. <BR>   <BR>I have developed an obsessive dread of Deadbuffalo&#39;s monsters, and <B>Blair</B> could be better than its trainer gives it credit for.  Its chars give it enhancements to its principle techs, and it has the best guts regen here.   <BR> <BR>I trained <B>Enkidu</B> to be a pow-monster killer, and, alas, he draws an int field.  His techs are maxxed, which is an advantage over this field, but his char deficiencies and slow guts regen could tell the tale...especially if he overuses Wing Storm.    <BR> <BR>Finally, <B>SS Wins</B> emerges from what is increasingly looking like one of the stronger tourneys, the Hengar Challenge.  However, against this field, 558/601 lif/def is going to be fatal, i&#39;m afraid. <BR> <BR>May the best monster win!

 Go BEWD! I have a good feeling for Endiku, but the blob has a bit of some competition material for this particular bracket. SS and DB are a bit evenly matched with SS at a bit of a disadvantage. Well, whatever happens, good luck to all of your monsters!
