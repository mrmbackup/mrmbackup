 I don&#39;t expect a whole lot of trouble from Freddy B, and i am hoping Cat Fool will hinder Kitty. Then again you never know. I am most worried about Flo. Hopefully Spinach&#39;s Sharp Eyes, and Radar is enough to make up for Flo&#39;s Fats Footwork. <BR> <BR>I am still not sure if Spinach&#39;s High Output is useful at all, or even positive in general.  <BR> <BR>I fear for Spinach because of the pathetic Hengar guts regain. If Spinach has a downfall, it will be it&#39;s guts regain.

 That was a very unusual win, but still a win. That was a nice battle though, that will always remain a mystery to how that hengar beat that blob. :&#41;

All three are maxxed; all three have helpful chars; all three have maxxed their techs. <BR> <BR>I choose <B>Spinach</B> because it has the best chance of landing several damaging techs each round.  Whenever we have seen a hengar in a high level battle, we see them plodding along, hitting two or three times a match for 200&#43; damage each time.  Needless to say, <B>Spinach</B> is the best hengar there is.  Both mews have fast footwork, but the bot&#39;s sharp eyes/radar/high% triumvarate will overcome that, while the mews face some disadvantages in trying to hit the green machine.  Needless to say, <B>Flo</B> and <B>Kitty</B> have massive advantages as well - most of all guts regen.  I prefer the mew&#39;s moveset; i prefer the bambiimew&#39;s sharp eyes.  I can see Cat Fool redeeming itself as a tech; I have trouble imagining a helpful Hawaiian, however...take away the spiral hula thing, and i probably make <B>Kitty</B> the favorite here, although still not by much. <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s <B>Freddy</B>.  The king of raidens finds himself in the same position he finds himself in when back home at the ranch - that of taking on a mess o&#39; maxxed monsters.  He usually surprises at least one, and i will predict that the potent penguin will manage one upset this tourney.  However, he will be unable to amass more than one such victory, which leaves him essentially with no chance of coming out on top of this, the <B><FONT COLOR="0000ff"><FONT SIZE="+2">GREATEST BRACKET EVER!!!</FONT></FONT></B>

 Thanks Torey, for having so much faith in Spinach. I wish i did as well. Then again i never felt certain of a win. Well, maybe Halo because she dwarfed her competion in the Pixie Challenge. Anyway i really hope Spinach does me proud, though i fear some of the nasty techs those Mew have. oh well, we&#39;ll see monday night.

 The more I think about this the more I say hogwash.  There had to be some outside determining factor that made Fenrick&#39;s Mew miss so much with Cat Fool. <BR> <BR>As far as hawaiian goes against another Mew...I almost believe you into the tech being a non factor.  My experience with Hawaiian is this.  It hits 2/3&#39;s of the time.  Each use costs 21 points of guts and costs the opponent approximately 40...so hitting twice kills 80 guts and you lose 63 plus the cost in guts freeze while casting which makes it almost a dead wash on the guts end.  You can get in trouble in individual matches if you miss but the law of averages balances out over time.  I think the only one who I&#39;d have a problem using it against is Flo as the others just gain too slow. <BR> <BR>I see the guts regen differential really coming into play in the last 20 seconds of these matches with the Mew&#39;s holding large guts advantages over the other two and thereby hitting more and harder toward the end of the individual matches &#40;god if this were only a tag team cage match&#41;...this is where I like Kitty...her lower cost techs will have her hopefully outpointing in the end.  I think the real question of the tourney is which Mew lands Zap....the only close to knockout move either has.  Were it not for the low guts regen I&#39;d heavily favor spinach in this tourney but the guts regen kills it. <BR> <BR>Regardless, I love this field.  2 Mew&#39;s make for a real interesting showdown.  I&#39;ve started the Joker now and almost hope I lose this one just so I can enter tourney number 3...But to all, happy ranching and good luck.

 Maxxed Joker eh? Sounds good Campster, and I&#39;m pretty sure that the over-rated Zan and Joker will make a good head to head&#40;if each of our cats loses&#41;. Good luck on the Joker and tell us when your done!

The problem with the gutsdown Campster is what if the other monster just used a 50 gut attack. Instead of Hawaiian dropping out 40 guts, as it would have before the monster used the 50 guts, it only does about 10 or so... And usually 50 guts techs are pretty nasty.  <BR>Hawaiian is great, unless the other monster gets a strong hit in. And despite the best defenses, every monster can expect to be hit hard in practically every tournament. I&#39;ll correct myself. Hawaiian is great, <B>until</B> the other monster gets a strong hit in.

 Actually, Hawaiian is Great till you miss and that opens the door for the other guy to get that strong hit in. <BR> <BR>I love the tech when I&#39;m in control of battles because I can choose when to use it...The AI is bad at knowing when to use it and always uses it it seems when the other guy is already low on guts.

 Jeremy C, the Joker, is one cool dude.  Anyone else had Characteristics change when passing down a heart?  New characteristics appear that weren&#39;t on the heart and weren&#39;t on the receiving monster. <BR> <BR>I like his tech set I&#39;ve chosen &#40;swinging the pedulum to just smacking the crept out of other monsters as opposed to chiping away like Kitty&#41;. He is a tempermental cuss though.  Failed alot to start with.

 Already have a contingency monster Campster ? :&#41; <BR>I do that too.  <BR>As a side note, Joker would be on my monster &#34;to do&#34; list, except for their short life span and aforementioned bad attitude. They have an interesting array of techs that I haven&#39;t been able to adapt to any particular strategy. I&#39;ll be curious to see how Jeremy turns out. <BR>As for Characteristics changing when passing down a heart, i haven&#39;t had that happen to me. But I have heard of characteristics being aquired, but hidden on the characteristics screen, and then passing on to a new monster. Nothing i&#39;ve seen &#40;or looked for&#41;, but its possible. <BR> <BR>And on an unrelated note, good luck to Kitty and you tonight.
