Ah the MR3 Baby Cup.  This tournamentr has always interested me since it is just so unpredictable.  ANyway, on with the recap. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Raptor X</FONT> vs. <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Ikazuchi</FONT>:  Both monsters had one powerful attack that could make or break them depending on their luck, and they had to use it right to win.  Raptor X&#39;s Large Roller, however, was more risky since it had self damage.  Consequently, in every round trhat Raptor missed with Large Roller, he lost to Ika&#39;s better attacks.  He managed to pull one round out, almost KO&#39;ing Ika, but he nevertheless went down in four. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Ikazuchi 3-1 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">RaptorX</FONT> vs. <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Crebus</FONT> <BR> <BR>Crebus had a totally different strategy from Raptor.  He needed to dodge most of what was thrown at him while, at the same time, dishiong it out with quick tiger techs.  AFter a frustrating round one in which he missed all of his powerful attacks, Raptor came back in round 2 with a lartge roller and a mosin to KO Crebus.  Crebus just plain didn&#39;t do much in round three, allwoing Rap&#91;tor to take a 2-1 lead.  Then, Crebus came back in round 4 to dodge every attack thrown at him, winning 33.9% to 100%.  Then, it was the final round.  Crebus needed this win to have a chance while Raptor was trying to redeem himself from his last round.  Crebus did three techs...for about 100 dmage total.  Meanwhile, Raptor was giving it his all, finally hitting a large roller and a mosin for a 2 hit KO. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">WInner</FONT>: RaptorX 3-2 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">RaptorX</FONT> vs. <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Shroom</FONT>:  This fight was similar to the last one.  Shroom relied on volume of attacks while Raptor relied more on quality.  After winning the first round with a large roller, he lost the second round by missing with it.  See the trend?  He hit with the attack again for a KO in round 3, then missed ands lost in round 4.  It all came down to the decisive final battle, which was close because Raptor DID manage to hit his large roller attack.  However, through a life stealing sucker and some octo beams, Shroom won the day 52.5% to 35.7%. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Shroom 3-2 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Crebus</FONT> vs. <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Shroom</FONT>:  This match was not horribly exciting.  Both monsters just threw the same low level attacks at eachother over and over again.  The outcome it seemed, would depend on luck alone.  Round 1 saw Crebus winning but just being more dodgy and aggressive, winning by a 40% margin.  That margin was smaller in round 4, but  the tiger won again anyway.  Round three saw a turnaround in which Shroom finally dodged some attacks, but in round four he lost totally when Crebus was never hit. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Crebus 3-1 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Ikazuchi</FONT> vs. <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Crebus</FONT>:  This proved to be the best fight of the night, as tech overload Crebus faced off against Mr. Ion Cannon Ikazuchi.  In round one, Ika blocked or dodged all attacks thrown at him despite landing only one beam himself, winning 100% to 37.2%.  Howeever, the exact opposite happened in round 2, tying it up 1-1.  In round 3, Crebus won out once again since Ika had STILL not landed his Ion Cannon attack.  In the fourth round, both monsters did about the same amount of damage to eachother, but Ika survived because of higher life.  Then, came round 5.  Crebus knew that this was his chance to get himself entered into a three way tie, so he went all out with tiger fangs and charges.  However, it was all for not, since that was followed by a 325 ION CANNON for an instant KO and win for Ikazuchi. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Ikazuchi 3-2 <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Shroom</FONT> vs. <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Ikazuchi</FONT>:  I myself did not expect this round to be very close but Shroom gave it his all regardless.  In round 1, in fact, nothing hit him at all, winning it for him 100% to 58.3%.  Sadly, for him however, his octopi attacks were no match for Ika in rounds two and three, which he lost out of a sheer lack of offensive power.  It all ended in the fourth round, the first round of it&#39;s type.  Attacks were everywhere, with both monsters dodging and blocking left and right.  Perhaps they did that a bit too much, nothing ever hit, leaving both monsters at full life.  However, out of a guts advantage, the game declared Ikazuchi the winner. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Winner</FONT>: Ikazuchi <BR> <BR>So there you have it, Ikazuchi is the MR3 Metalner Day CHampion while the rest of the monsters are all 1-2.  Next years metalner day just might have mr4 competition, which is something I&#39;m very excited for.  All hail Fenrick and Ikazuchi!
