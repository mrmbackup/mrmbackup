 Can&#39;t tell the Mocchi&#39;s form, but other than that it is refreshing to meet the new combatants. <BR> <BR>Unfortunatly, Gail is going to win. I&#39;d put Squee in for second, but Squee&#39;s skinny, which descreases his threshhold of pain. Gail will be reeling if an Int. Based move lands, but I think his attacks will mangle the Wrackey first. <BR> <BR>I have been wrong before.

 quickie morning line and predictions: <BR> <BR>Gail 1-1 <BR>Minisquee 3-1 <BR>Zeus 6-1 <BR>Hybrid 6-1 <BR> <BR>Gail has the build of a champ - gaboos can win these things, and the only slightly false note is the int tech in 3d range.  Minisquee is almost as good, but has the &#34;pixie/phoenix problem&#34; of an int monster with a pow tech in close range.  with a little luck, tho, he can still win.  Zeus has an empty third range, and has sacrificed speed - never a good idea in mr2 comps.  Hybrid has his techs right, but has sacrificed speed almost entirely.  It will take a lot of luck for those two to win. <BR> <BR>Looks like fun, though - I should be there for the &#34;throwdown at High Noon&#34;.

 How dare thou put a Worm last.   <BR> <BR>Hybrid 3-2 <BR>Gail 5-3 <BR>Minisquee 4-1 <BR>Zeus 10-1 <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not overly fond of how many sub Tigers we have in A class...but that&#39;s no big.  Props to squee for the joker sub, classy.  Gail is a Gaboo, and Hybrid is a worm.  Both are what people don&#39;t usually see win.  I had both near champions so let&#39;s see what I can put through here... <BR> <BR>Gaboo is a great monster, but with too many techs he doesn&#39;t get to the good ones too quickly...small tech area with top notch attacks gives Hybrid an edge.  Though with low speed, Ninja Kick is gonna knock Hybrid in the hizzle..IF he uses it.  I&#39;m going with luck of the worms. <BR> <BR>Minisquee is nice...but power techs noooooo.  He can get lucky and dodge everything and hit all his Flames.  It could happen.  I just hope he doesn&#39;t have Cursed Dance as his extreme range tech at the beginning....or he loses every time &#62;&#60; <BR> <BR>Zeus is a good monster in the wrong bracket.  This Market Monster will get torn up with his sloppy stats.  I guess they only make good S entrants =&#92; <BR> <BR>ENDING MEPERSONER STYLE <BR>It doesn&#39;t matter who wins, I&#39;m gonna destroy the competition. <BR> <BR>Looks fun.

It&#39;s nice to see that someone has confidence in Hybrid...I can&#39;t say that I do.  <BR> <BR>If I had to say by what I think will happen, I&#39;d go Gail, Minisquee, Hybrid, and Zeus. If I had to go by evil hunches from deep within my gut, I&#39;d say Minisquee, Zeus, Hybrid, Gail...how odd.  <BR> <BR>This&#39;ll be an odd one methinks. <BR> <BR>GO <FONT COLOR="0000ff">HYBRID</FONT>!

The rare matinee tourney is now in the books.  Some twists and turns along the way, but in the end, at least the winner was predictable.  Gail wins with a perfect 3-0; the other three tie for second &#91;and last&#93; at 1-2.  Here&#39;s how it happened: <BR> <BR><B>Gail v Zeus</B>.  Gail led off with 2 straight KO&#39;s, but Zeus managed to get a win before Gail used a 999 chop combo in power for game, set and match.  <B>Gail 3-1</B> <BR> <BR><B>Hybrid v Zeus</B>.  This was even worse.  The worm just knocked the snot out of overmatched mocchi.  <B>Hybrid 3-0</B> <BR> <BR><B>Minisquee v Zeus</B>.  Zeus must have heard the laughter - he woke up with a vengeance against Minisquee.  The lil tricker was his own worst enemy, however, having for some reason settled on a strategy of using weapon as his sole tech...which either missed or did like 2 damage crit.  In the essential 5th match, though, Zeus used roll attack, press and slap to good advantage, restoring a little of his good name.  <B>Zeus 3-2</B> <BR> <BR><B>Minisquee v Gail</B>  The devil doll continued his reliance on his &#34;weapon of mass uselessness&#34; against the powerful Gaboo.  He did win the first 100-99 % decision I&#39;ve ever seen, but otherwise it wasnt close.  <B>Gail 3-1</B> <BR> <BR><B>Minisquee v Hybrid</B>.  And again, another monster on the verge of becoming a laughingstock pulls an unexpected reversal.  Gone was the useless weapon guy; now a series of 100 or so point damaging and draining techs like weapon throw and necromancy kept the worm totally frustrated.  Hybrid never got untracked; Minisquee made it look easy. <B>Minisquee 3-0</B> <BR> <BR><B>Gail v Hybrid</B>.  So Hybrid had to win two consecutive matches in a row against the imposing gaboo.  This was a see-saw affair, with each monster taking turns dominating a battle, until it was 2-2.  The ethical and vital 5th reminded me of how good these things can be.  Neither monster backed down; they went toe-to-toe, throwing tech after tech at one another.  More of Gail&#39;s landed - Gail emerged bloodied, but unbowed, as the champion.  <B>Gail 3-2</B> <BR> <BR>So the last qualifier for the finals has had his ticket punched.  All Hail Gail!  All Hail Red Hare!
