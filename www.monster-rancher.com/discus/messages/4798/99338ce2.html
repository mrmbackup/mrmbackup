Well folks, the velo is back and in style &#40;as always&#41;, bringing you the recap hot off the presses. <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Fight 1: Dog Toy vs. Jet Li</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 1:</FONT> Jet Li got off to a bad start as he attempted his powerful fire attack...only to have it absolutely blocked by Dog Toy.  The ColorPandora responded with two high damage big spins to <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT> poor Jet. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 2:</FONT> Jet Li had a little more luck this time, his wing storms hit for medium damage and always dizzied, but once again he was bettered by Dog Toy&#39;s superior techs, this time throwing in a thundader for the relatively quick <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 3:</FONT> Jet Li had simply given up at this point, all of his techs were blocked and he layed down to a couple of thundaders, leaving DT with the <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT> and the win. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Dog Toy 3, Jet Li 0</FONT> <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Fight 2: SS WIns vs. Finale</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 1:</FONT> Finale was strutting his stuff, exhibiting his very dangerous withering move balloon pop along with other weak but effective techs, winning the match about <FONT COLOR="0077aa">100% to 30%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 2:</FONT> SS Wins came back in style, inflicting a massive damage from a 969 ion cannon right off the bat and continuing on to do another for 905, getting the very decisive <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT> win. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 3:</FONT> This round was closer than the others.  FInales unleashed a whopping five thunderbolds in a row, withering SS wins to near 0 and sufficiently damaging him.  However, his combination of a beam and a force bomber was enough to win him the round at <FONT COLOR="0077aa">62% to 30%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 4:</FONT> This one was a bit...sad.  FInale went into a frenzy of weak but withering attacks while SS wins finally gathered enough energy to do...ray field...twice...allowing Finale to get the <FONT COLOR="0077aa">100% to 52%</FONT> win <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 5:</FONT> In the fifth and final round of the best match of the day, Finale got the early lead in his usual mix of techs.  However, SS wins charged up and fired a mighty ion cannon...only to let it be blocked.  Finale carried his luck on to the last second, winning the match <FONT COLOR="0077aa">78% to 13%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Finale 3, SS Wins 2</FONT> <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">SS Wins vs. Dog Toy</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 1:</FONT> SS Wins hit one beam for 190 while Dog Toy smashed SS with a 999 big spin for a short and sweet <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 2:</FONT> This one was a bit better, but only marginally.  SS Wins did get in an ion cannon, but it was blocked and a single thundader was enough to <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT> the poor Henger. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 3:</FONT> Just like in the first round, after a beam and a big spin, the round was over and SS Wins was <FONT COLOR="ff0000">down and out cold</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Dog Toy 3, SS WIns 0</FONT> <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">SS WIns vs. Jet Li</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 1:</FONT> Jet Li tried a couple of dragon bites...all were blocked.  SS WIns did an ion cannon...Jet Li was <FONT COLOR="ff0000">on the floor</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 2:</FONT> This time, Jet went for quantity over quality.  It didn&#39;t help much however, for even after six attacks including a &#34;wong storm,&#34; all were blocked and he couldn&#39;t stand up to SS Wins, losing <FONT COLOR="0077aa">100% to 52%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 3:</FONT> Once again, all of Jet&#39;s attacks were blocked and he was <FONT COLOR="ff0000">taken down</FONT> by Ss Wins.  Do I see a pattern here? <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">SS Wins 3, Jet Li 0</FONT> <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Finale vs. Jet Li</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 1:</FONT> As per usual, FInale showed off a multitude of minus 100 but withering atacks that simply left Jet Li whimpering for a break, winning the round <FONT COLOR="0077aa">90% to 32%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 2:</FONT> Jet Li did one attack, which was blocked.  Finale did a lot, and they all hit.  Bing bang boom, <FONT COLOR="0077aa">100% to 41%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 3:</FONT> Jet did a little better this time, but only marginally.  He managed to hit one of his attacks for about 100 damage, but Finale had landed about four more, enough to win the round and the match <FONT COLOR="0077aa">91% to 65%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Finale 3, Jet Li 0</FONT> <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Finale vs. Dog Toy</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 1:</FONT> Ah the final match.  Finale was pumped up and ready to try to beat the seemingly unstoppable CP Dog Toy, hoping that huge withering would be enough to win it for him.  Sadly, it was not.  Finale did indeed hit several techs throughout the match, withering DT&#39;s guts down immensely, but all that he was hit by &#40;all that DT needed&#41; was a single big spin, doing 683 damage and winning it for the CP <FONT COLOR="0077aa">60% to 31%</FONT>. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 2:</FONT> This one was much shorter.  Finale did one turn stab for 60 damage.  Dog Toy did a thundader and a big spin for a combined 1425 damage, giving him the quite devastating <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT> win. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">Round 3:</FONT>The final round proved to be much like the second.  Finale started well with a critical 257 balloon pop, but he proceeded to flounder the rest of his attacks, letting Dog Toy get in another Big Spin-Thundader combo for the last <FONT COLOR="ff0000">KO</FONT> of the night. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Dog Toy 3, Finale 0</FONT> <BR> <BR> <BR><CENTER><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">The Final Standings</FONT></CENTER> <BR> <BR>1. Dog Toy &#40;3-0&#41; <BR>2. Finale &#40;2-1&#41; <BR>3. SS Wins &#40;1-2&#41; <BR>4. Jet Li &#40;0-3&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks to all the trainers who entered and to Fen for hosting such a great tournament!  All hail Dog Toy, who will continue on to the finals!  Good night MRM!
