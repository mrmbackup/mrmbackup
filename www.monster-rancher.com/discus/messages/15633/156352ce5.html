 I&#39;m trying to download it now, but my phone has a horrid signal in my office. <BR> <BR>When I get it downloaded and actually get to play a bit I&#39;ll try to post some info. <BR> <BR>At least from the marketplace it&#39;s been getting a lot of positive reviews. A lot of people are saying it&#39;s reminding them of MR1. Here&#39;s hoping this game does turn out well and possibly sparks some new interest in the franchise.

 I downloaded and played a bit... it has a battle function, training etc but the resting process seems a bit different... &#40;I don&#39;t think there was one&#41; Or I was too lazy to pay attention.

 Allright so I got about half an hour with the game last night and I&#39;ll post up what I remember. <BR> <BR>I believe there are 243 Monsters, some of the breeds include. <BR>-Mew &#40;my starter&#41; <BR>-Hare <BR>-Tiger <BR>-Golem <BR>-Mocchi <BR>-Suezo <BR>-Poncho <BR>-Naga <BR>-Leslione <BR>-Dragon <BR> <BR>There are more that you can unlock but I haven&#39;t gotten quite that far yet. <BR> <BR>You need to sign up an account, and then you get your first monster based on your account &#40;I&#39;m not sure quite how this works&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Training: This doesn&#39;t have any animations that go with it, you choose a training &#40;which are ranked with stars with how confident the monster is with them&#41; and then either you pass, do great, or you fail. If you fail you get a &#43;1 to the chosen stat, if you suceed you get more. My Monster tends to get a 3-4 when it succeeds. <BR> <BR>Also with trianing, and most everything else, you gain experience for both the monster and your trainer rank. I&#39;m not sure what increasing these does quite yet, all I know is that by increasing your trainer rank your monsters get an extra point in stamina. <BR> <BR>Stamina: Training costs your monster stamina, it starts up on a 100 scale and then increases as your trainer rank increases. Most training causes 10 stamina, and the lower your stamina the more likely the monster is to fail &#40;I think&#41;.  <BR> <BR>There is no rest option so you can increase your stamina by either feeding the monster or waiting and letting it increase on its own, which happens after a set period of time which you can see under your monsters stat area.  <BR> <BR>The food items are pretty pricey and so far battles have not been giving very much money. You can also buy credits with real money to use to rest up your monster.  <BR> <BR>Battles: I&#39;ve only done the tutorial battles which were 1 on 1 fights, no tournament style battles yet. How battles work is all your stats are on a horizontal line, and a stat is chosen at random. Your monsters stat is compared with the enemies and the person with the larger number wins the round. It goes back and forth like this until someone wins enough times in a row to beat the other monster. None of my fights have taken more then 3 rounds though so I&#39;m not sure if there are ties or what.  <BR> <BR>You can choose how your monster fights between the options of Aggressive, Balanced, or Defensive. I have chosen Balanced each time so far and it tells you that the monster will fight evenly through the whole match. With Aggressive it says that the monster will try hider earlier on, and defensive they will try harder later on in the fight. <BR> <BR>Also somehow you stats can increase when being compared to other monsters. When my Mew was fighting it&#39;s Int score was only 100, but then the battle landed on the Int stat to compare between the monsters and somehow mine increased to 143. I&#39;m not sure why, or what modifies this yet as I haven&#39;t had enough time with the game.  <BR> <BR>Neighbors: With this option you go and check out another players ranch, you can pet their monsters and give them gifts. If you pet another persons monster that monster is added to your Wiki &#40;The encyclopedia of this game&#41; and you can use that with a certain disk stone to create that monster at a later time. You can also become friends with neighbors and, I think freely, recreate the monsters that they have on their ranch.  <BR> <BR>Combination: I haven&#39;t actually gotten to do this yet, but there are two options here. You can combine two monsters you have in the freezer, or you can combine one of your monsters with a friends monster. That&#39;s all I know of this. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t used the freezer or gone on any adventures yet so I saddly can not comment on that. In the monsters stats page there is also an area for &#34;techniques&#34;, I don&#39;t know how to get these yet and am not sure what it does, but it interests me.  <BR> <BR>Oh also I believe you can have up to 3 monsters on your ranch at a time. This will be helpful since you need to wait for your monsters stamina to go back up, so you can spend that time working with another monster.  <BR> <BR>All in all I had a really good time with the game. It&#39;s really simplistic and I do wish a few things were upgraded &#40;such as some sort of animation with training or with battles&#41;, but all in all it&#39;s a worthwhile free game that shows promise to grow. I&#39;m sure with time they can add new monsters and upgrades. I really hope the game catches on. <BR> <BR>If you have an Android and enjoy the series then for sure pick up this game, but dont&#39; expect too much, it is a game for a phone afterall. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post more as I learn about it.  <BR> <BR>Also if you are playing my characters name is HAChaos. Friend me!

 Thanks! <BR> <BR>So, there&#39;s no set universal way for people to get a particular monster? -Meaning there won&#39;t be the equivalent of a CD or Passwords list here?

 It doesn&#39;t look like it right now. <BR> <BR>In the shop you can buy disc stones of certain pure breeds. <BR> <BR>As you go on more could possibly open up.  <BR> <BR>I would think there would have to be a way to get disc stones with other monsters on them. Though I have no proof yet, I would think that perhaps they could be prizes from tournaments or items found when you go on adventures. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;m not far enough in it to know yet. I hope there is another way to get monsters. <BR> <BR>If I find some other way I&#39;ll be sure to post it.

 Allright so a few more details. <BR> <BR>You can raise up to 2 monsters on your ranch in the begining. As you move forward you unlock the ability to raise 3, possibly more. I believe you have to buy in game currency to unlock this though. <BR> <BR>Once another person has accepted a Neighbor request from you then you can generate their monsters once a day. You can do this up to 10 times a day. <BR> <BR>When you go to other breeders ranches and pet their monsters you get something called a Monster Medal. So far the only thing I&#39;ve found to use these on are getting random items from a dispenser. Doing this costs 20 monster medals.  <BR> <BR>You unlock Adventure mode by getting your breeder rank to rank 4, this is pretty easy. I haven&#39;t gone on an adventure yet because I just unlocked it right before leaving for work this morning. I&#39;ll probably have some updates on that tomorrow.  <BR> <BR>You unlock combining by getting your breeder rank to rank 6.  <BR> <BR>I have a bit more information on Battles. First of all the battles do not go back and forth until one monster is knocked out and there are no ties. The monster who wins 3/5 when comparing stats is the winner.  <BR> <BR>Choosing Aggressive, Balanced, or Defensive decides what rounds your stats are increased by some multiplier. If you choose aggressive then your stats are increased in the first two rounds of the fight, and slightly decreased the rest of the fight. If you choose Balanced then your stats are normal for the first two bouts, increased the third and fourth, and decreased in the fifth. Then with Defensive you have normal stats for the first three bouts and increased stats in the last two.  <BR> <BR>I have learned a few things about techniques, but nothing too solid yet. First of all it seems that techniques are learned by leveling up your monster. You monster gets experience by training and levels up once you have enough experience. It looks like the experience gained by the monster is equal to the stat increase that monster gets, I may be wrong on that though. I have not been able to try out techniques yet, but in an official battle I had the enemy use one. When we landed on the Speed Stat to compare it said the enemy used a technique and his speed increased and just beat me. So it looks like techniques are used in battles to give your a stat boost. So far both my Mew and my Nage learned Techniques at level 3, the Mew learned Jab and I can&#39;t remember what my Naga learned.  <BR> <BR>Stamina: This is easily the worst part of the game, early on at least. It costs 10 stamina to train and the ony ways to get your stamina increased is by leveling up &#40;which fully fills your stamina&#41;, giving your monster an item &#40;which are expensive at least early on and only heal about 10 stamina points&#41;, waiting for a timer to count down &#40;you regain 1 stamina point every 3 minutes. This times adds up really quickly&#41;, or pay real money to get your monster rested.  <BR> <BR>Luckily battles do not cost any stamina, but I&#39;m not sure if going to battles over and over again hurts your monsters longevity or not. Heck I still don&#39;t know if monster can die or be force retired. Right now my Mew is 10 months old and is considered an Adult.  <BR> <BR>So I believe that is all of the new things that I learned from playing last night and quickly this morning. Hopefully I&#39;ll have some more info about adventures to share tomorrow.  <BR> <BR>If anyone has any questions please post them, if I know it I&#39;ll answer it and if not I&#39;ll try to do some research on it in game to get the answer. <BR> <BR>Once I get some more time I&#39;ll try to make item lists/monster lists with what I have and what the items do.

 I can work on a monster list, we need to know what number each breed is. &#40;check the MR1 section for the &#39;All The Monsters&#39; post&#41; -If the game gives them numbers. If there are descriptions, we&#39;d like those as well.

 From what I looked at it may be pretty difficult to get a list going without having access to more monsters. There&#39;s still a lot of hidden breeds on my game and they don&#39;t really give a list of how many your missing, so it&#39;s kind of a craps shoot. <BR> <BR>Also unfortunately you can&#39;t play the game without access to the internet, so I can&#39;t sneak away from my office and write down what i have. But I&#39;ll try and get a list together with what I know over the next few days. <BR> <BR>A few more updates! <BR> <BR>Battle wise, if you lose a battle against a computer oponent you can refight them right away in some cases &#40;official battles and non time sensitive battles&#41;. When doing this the stats that the battle &#34;randomly&#34; chooses to compare will be the same as the last time you fought that monster. So say the stats it chooses to compare in the fight go Health, SKill, Power, Int, Speed. The next time you fight it will show up in that same order &#40;at least it has for each time I&#39;ve redone a battle&#41;. With this you can change your strat &#40;Aggresive, balanced, defensive&#41; to try and beat the enemy. <BR> <BR>Also some battle are time sensitive and some are not. There are battle that monster can compete in 1 time per day at any time. These are usually simple battles that give money as a prize. Then there are time sensitive battles. What this means is that the battle will be held at 2 am for example. If you sign your monster up for that battle you are unable to further train it until after that 2am mark. Then  once 2am has passed there will be an option to Battle. You do not need to be logged in at 2am to battle, just have signed up before that point. These battles give items and even Disc Stones. I won a Suezo disc stone this morning.  <BR> <BR>Combining. You unlock this whne you get to breeder rank six, and you can not combine willy nilly. Each monster needs to be at least 1 year old to be eligible to combine. You can then combine 2 of your own monsters together to get a new one &#40;it&#39;s very similar to MR1/2 style where it gives you a percentage of what monster you will get&#41; or you can combine one of your monsters with a monster of someone on your friends list. There are combination items but I have not recieved any of those yet so I can&#39;t comment on them. <BR> <BR>Adventures. When you open up adventure you start with 2 of them, and I don&#39;t have the game in front of me so I can&#39;t tell you what they are. Anyway these are timed events, so if you send a monster out on one adventure that monster will not get back until five minutes have passed, in the second adventure it takes twenty minutes. By doing adventures you explore 15% of the area with your chosen monster and have a small possibility of getting a stat increase. It says that you can get items from adventures but I have yet to find any, also I am not sure what happens when a monster explores an area to 100%. Hopefully I will be able to complete an area tonight and report back on it tomorrow.  <BR> <BR>Ah also real quick, Piroro is in the game. I also have a hunch that the monster list may look very very similar to the MR DS list, but I don&#39;t have any proof of that, it&#39;s just kind of a gut feeling I&#39;m getting from the rest of the game. It looks like they took snapshops of monsters in MR DS and used those to create rough animations of each monster on the farm, that&#39;s the only reason I say it&#39;s a possibility.  <BR> <BR>Missions. These are little milestones that you complete and get rewards for, and it&#39;s the quickest way in the begining to up your breeder rank. Most things give you 1 exp towards your breeder rank, most missions give about 20exp. By doing things like training a monster for the first time, winning your first battle, winning ten battles, combining your first monster ect, you finish missions. When you finish a mission you get an item and some breeder exp. It seems kind of like a tutorial at first, and then more of an achievements system after that.  <BR> <BR>Monsters do have descriptions in the Wiki section of the game, when I get some time I&#39;ll try to go through the monsters I currently have in my book and write out what they are and their descriptions.

 Yeah it&#39;s still pretty new and it seems they are still adding a lot of the features, items, and working on compatability problems. <BR> <BR>Hopefully it will be more accessible to people soon because it is a pretty fun little game.

 Allright not too much new stuff to post today. There were some server errors and I couldnt play this morning and only had a bit of time to play last night. My wife is out of time so that means it&#39;s time for me to brew a few ales and spend as much time with Skyrim as possible. :P <BR> <BR>So first of all, Beaclon is in. <BR> <BR>As far as the monster list goes, the monsters are not specifically numbered, but it&#39;s set up in a way that we could give them numbers. Also when you have a page of a certain monster type in your Wiki you can find out how many breeds of that monster is in the game. For example I believe there are 9 different suezo breeds and I&#39;ve seen 2 of the 9. But you can not click on breeds you have not seen yet, so until every monster type is unlocked I can&#39;t give a full count of how many of each breed there are. If the system lets me in today or tomorrow though I&#39;ll post up the ones I have and try to at least start a list.  <BR> <BR>A bit of an update on adventures. You certainly can find items on adventures as well as increase your stats. What I have found are items that are gift items you can give to other breeders monsters to help increase their fame. I believe one of the tutorials said that if a particular stat is high then you have a better chance of finding stuff, likely this would be Int like the other games but I have no proof. <BR> <BR>Also I found out what happens when you explore an area 100%, you unlock a different adventuring area in the same area. So I believe the first adventure area is Tagi Jungle, and the first part of the jungle is something like &#34;Jungle Road&#34;. The Jungle Road takes 5 minutes for your monster to explore 15% of the area. This is cumulative, any monster exploring the same area adds to the total. Once 100% is hit then you unlock the next area, in this case it&#39;s something like &#34;Jungle Canopy&#34; and it now takes 10 minutes to explore that area. You can still adventure in the Jungle Road if you like for possible stat increases and items.  <BR> <BR>I think my Naga is getting to the end of it&#39;s lifespan, he&#39;s currently a Senior at only about 2 years of age, so I will likely be combining him soon. So I&#39;ll hopefully have updates on that soon.  <BR> <BR>Ah also a bit more on battles, it looks like there are a lot more classes in this game. I believe you start at either G-3 or G-2, then theres an official battle to go up to G-1, Then you get to F-3, F-2, F-1. I&#39;ve currently only gotten to F-2...hmm maybe F-1 I can&#39;t remember. Anyway it seems like there are a lot of battles to through and I do not believe you are able to skip ranks. You have to do an official battle in each rank to be able to go up to the next area.  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s about all the new stuff I have for today.  <BR> <BR>Brohoof!

 Hey everyone, unfortunately no big update today. <BR> <BR>The servers woulnd&#39;t connect whenever I tried to play this weekend, and without being able to log on you can&#39;t check or do anything in the game. So I really couldn&#39;t experiment with anything or write down any monster or descriptions. I&#39;ll try again tonight, but from what I&#39;ve read with other users it looks like they may still be getting their servers stable. I&#39;ll update as soon as I can.

 Allright, a little bit more info. <BR> <BR>New Monster Breeds I&#39;ve Seen <BR>- Baku <BR>- Colorpandora <BR>- Durahan <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also been going around to a bunch of other peoples ranches and petting their monsters to try and get more Wiki entries so I can update the monster list. Unfortunately there are still a bunch of new users who only have very very basic monsters. <BR> <BR>Monsters do not die in this game, after a certain point they retire. I&#39;m not sure what all contributes to this, but I worked my Naga to the bone, trained all of his stamina away at every opportunity, battled him as much as I could, and sent him on adventures frequently. He lived to be a little more then 2 years old. Once a monster is retired he can&#39;t battle, train, or go on adventures. Basically all you can do is freeze them and combine them. <BR> <BR>I found a pretty neat combination item in the random item game last night, it&#39;s a soul of Leslione. I can use it as a combine item to turn the monsters into a leslione. You can also buy combining items that raise a particular stat by 50.  <BR> <BR>Though I have not confirmed it, I noticed that a prize for winning a certain tournament was a ticket to the volcano region. I think by winning this tournament you unlock an adventure to that area. Or perhaps you are able to move your ranch to that area &#40;doubtful&#41;. There is an option to move your ranch, but I haven&#39;t unlocked anything for that section yet. <BR> <BR>When you go on adventures there is a chance for an &#34;event&#34; to happen. I&#39;ve only seen one of these and all that has happened was it told my monster fell down a crack and instead of exploring 15% of the place I explored 8%. I guess this is kind of like failing an adventure. If I find more &#34;Events&#34; I&#39;ll list them here.  <BR> <BR>Sometimes on your adventures you will find items, so far the items I&#39;ve found have only been &#34;present&#34; items. You can give these to other trainers monsters when you go to other ranches. What they do is they increase the other monsters fame and give you some Monster Medals to be used in the Gotcha Game.  <BR> <BR>Also if another trainer pets your monster you will get a small boost in that monsters next training, I&#39;ve only seen increases of 1 stat point, but that&#39;s better then nothing. <BR> <BR>I think that&#39;s all the new info I&#39;ve found out so far.

 A few new updates, and a bit of venting as well. <BR> <BR>On adventures you can get into battles and learn new techniques. My Tiger has learned 3-4 techniques from adventures and they deffinitally help in battle. Being able to increase your power by 30% and decrease the enemies by 20% can really tip the odds in your favor. But as you get higher up in battles the foes has a bunch of skills as well.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a limit to how many techniques you can set to a monster. Like I said my Tiger has learned 3-4 techniques and is able to equip them all at the same time, but I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a max. I could see some really interesting battle strats happening if there was a limit.  <BR> <BR>It looks like each adventure has 3 areas. The first one you explore 15% with each successful trip. The second one you explore at a rate of 8%, and it takes longer to explore then the first area, but you have a greater chance of events happening such as boosting a stat, fighting a rogue monster, or learning a technique. Then the third there is a boss monster you fight, if you win I believe you learn a technique. Saddly my tiger had already learned the technique it would have taught. The boss is refightable if you redo the adventure.  <BR> <BR>I still haven&#39;t unlocked any more adventures. I have recieved a Promias Ticket from a battle which says it unlocks Promias...but it hasn&#39;t yet. I guess I may need to rank up my battle class.  <BR> <BR>Now it&#39;s time for the venting part, they have recently updated the game with new items, all their use real money to buy items. You buy what they call Moba Coins with real money and use those in game to purchase things. I knew they were implenting this system and I was okay with it, but now that I have looked at it it is greedy to the point of insulting with how much they are asking you to pay for certain things. <BR> <BR>An item that you can feed to a monster once to get its stamina back up to full costs about $3-$4! A one time use item! Then if you want to expand your ranch so that you can train another monster it costs $20. It&#39;s rediculous.  <BR> <BR>The game is a fun little game, but these insane prices have put a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I never had any plan to use real money in the game from the start so I know this doesn&#39;t hurt me any, but as a long time gamer and Monster Rancher enthusiast it ticks me off a bit. <BR> <BR>Allright, theres my venting. All done! :D

 @Penguin God, as far as adventures go, the primary unlock to show more adventure areas is your breeder rank. At Breeder rank 20 you unlock the areas beyond Promias Ruins. <BR> <BR>Each adventure area has 2 stats it focuses on. Your monster may fail the adventure if it lacks these 2 stats. <BR> <BR>The Adventure areas I have unlocked are as follows: <BR> <BR>Tagi Jungle <BR> <BR>Contains 3 areas, the last of which is a boss monster &#40;roughly 1400 stats&#41;. The area is life/power based from memory. <BR> <BR>Torres Mountains <BR> <BR>Contains 3 areas, the last of which is a boss monster &#40;roughly 1700 stats&#41;. The area is life/defense based. <BR> <BR>Tugur Cave <BR> <BR>Contains 4 areas, the last of which is a boss monster &#40;roughly 1900 stats&#41;. The area is speed/int based. <BR> <BR>Promias Ruins <BR> <BR>Contains 2&#43; areas but I have not been able to clear it all due to requiring a ticket to access. You can win the ticket from battles, buy it, or win it in a Gacha game.  <BR> <BR>Promias Back Gate <BR> <BR>Unsure, have not obtained a single ticket to this adventure. <BR> <BR>Pinole Snow Mountain <BR> <BR>This place is Defense/Life based and I have only uncovered 1 area within it so far. I&#39;d guess it has 5 areas to it. <BR> <BR>Lantorna Estate <BR> <BR>Requires tickets, haven&#39;t acquired one yet. <BR> <BR>Lantorna Sanctuary <BR> <BR>Requires tickets, haven&#39;t acquired one yet. <BR> <BR>One thing to note is that progress slows as you get further through new adventures. The first place was 15% per run, it&#39;s now slowed to 8% per run. Each run takes longer now too. The jungle place took 5 minutes initially, and in perspective, the last area of Tugur Cave takes 4 hours. <BR> <BR>I agree regarding the in game prices though. The game is FAR too expensive.

 Oh and a small update regarding life span... I&#39;ve noticed that once a monster&#39;s energy goes red, further training will contribute to causing it to retire earlier.  <BR> <BR>If you only train a monster with yellow/green energy bar, it will live longer.  <BR> <BR>Apart from that, you can find peaches in the game in various adventure modes or tournament battles against other players. Copper peaches are the cheapest ones and extend careers for 3 months. I&#39;d imagine gold peaches extend by a year.

 Awesome Greek Snake, glad to see someone else on here who&#39;s able to play, and who apparently has had more time with the game then myself.  <BR> <BR>Whats your Moba name? We gotta friend up! <BR> <BR>Have you done much combining? Do stats stay relatively high when doing so? I&#39;m just now finishing up my Tiger to breed with my Naga, so I&#39;m curious as to what to expect. <BR> <BR>Interesting stuff about the adventures. I noticed that stats went up, but didn&#39;t see the correlation between which stats effected which adventures, but I should have guessed as much based around the other games.

 My Moba name is the same with no space greeksnake. Yours? <BR> <BR>I have done a fair bit of combining actually and the stats do remain high. Also, the base monster you choose decides the class that the new monster begins at. So if you get to E2 and chose that monster, the result monster is also E2 no matter what the 2nd monster is at. <BR> <BR>The level is usually some point between the 2 monsters you chose. <BR> <BR>The other thing to note is that not all the techs are taken over to the new monster and generally 2-3 of them are kept. You can get them easily by doing adventures but I just thought it was weird. <BR> <BR>You can see the monsters and stats that could eventuate from a combination also by pressing combination results before you actually combine. Also, if you know a stronger breeder, you can combine one of your strong monsters with theirs. It saves you having to get another similar monster up to par just to combine with yours. Neighbour combines do not &#34;use up&#34; the neighbors monster.

 My name is HAChaos, and that&#39;s great news about keeping your battle rank.  <BR> <BR>I was thinking it would be quite difficult to get to the higher rungs if something like that was not implemented. It takes awhile to open up those official bouts, and with each Letter ranking having multiple steps it would be near impossible to do with just one monster.

 Yea it definitely would be impossible to do with just one monster. <BR> <BR>It does take ages to open an official battle in the higher grades &#40;I&#39;m only at D2 myself&#41; but what I&#39;ve noticed is that the battles cycle every 12 hours so you get new battles at lunch time and at midnight. After you defeat all those, you can do the duels or the tournament battles against other players. <BR> <BR>I found that it&#39;s better to train the monster until the battle time so that you don&#39;t leave it queued for battle and unable to do anything. It&#39;s quite pointless to actually queue for a fight that&#39;s 2 hours away. <BR> <BR>Also, if you can&#39;t win certain fights, it&#39;s quite worth it to watch the battle and see where you are losing. Often you can substitute techs and overcome the opponent by winning on a stat that they are winning by a slim margin on. Also battle style plays a part there... often it&#39;s luck too. You just don&#39;t know when the enemy will go agressive/conservative etc.

 Got a bit further just recently and opened up the Kaurea Volcano adventure. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s power/int based and your monsters may fail at this adventure if they have less than 300 of either. <BR> <BR>I noticed I unlocked a 5th technique after breeder rank 25 so now my monsters are rocking 5 techniques instead of 4. It is hard to obtain the techs though as the breeding/combining does NOT retain the techs. <BR> <BR>Beating pinole snow mountains gives you a disc of centaur so you can make one of those when combining if you choose to. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m yet to get to B grade but the reward for getting in is a dragon so I might focus on that for a while. <BR> <BR>I also noticed that the game gives you a unique method of purchasing items. So long as you have owned an item in the past, you can always purchase it from the shop. Granted a copper peach is a ridiculous price of 50,000 CR, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever buy on... But it&#39;s nice to know I have the option. <BR> <BR>If you guys need any information for the guide don&#39;t hesistate to ask questions on here and I&#39;ll do my best to answer them.

 Update: <BR> <BR>After re-reading your post I might have been mistaken about what you are referring to. &#39;Promias Back Gate&#39; is probably not the same as &#39;Promias Ruins&#39; and &#39;Latorna Sanctuary&#39; is probably not the same as &#39;Latorna Estate&#39;. <BR> <BR>&#39;Promias&#39; Tickets can be bought with coins or credits, but from what I have seen &#39;Latorna&#39; and &#39;Grabad&#39; tickets cannot be bought with either &#40;at least today, as I was writing this&#41;. I&#39;ll have to start keeping an eye out to see if perhaps the special tickets you mentioned are only available for sale on certain days of the week... Today is of course Wednesday, and I only see the &#39;Promias Ruins&#39; ticket for sale for 2k credits, and the &#39;Promias Back Gate&#39; ticket for sale for 40 coins.

 @Ray <BR> <BR>You are correct in saying back gate is not the same as ruins. <BR> <BR>For each ticketed area, there is one area with winnable tickets from battles and gatcha, and there is another area that is accesable ONLY buy BUYING tickets for real money. <BR> <BR>Promias Ruins = winnable tickets <BR>Promias Back Gate = purchase tickets with real cash <BR> <BR>Lantorna Estate = winnable tickets <BR>Lantorna Sanctuary = purchase tickets with cash <BR> <BR>Grabad Factory = winnable tickets  <BR>Grabad Warehouse = purchase tickets with cash <BR> <BR>I believe it&#39;s breeder rank based as to when you can unlock the purchase of these tickets.

 As far as changes in this new update go, here are a few I have noticed: <BR> <BR>-Timezone is now reflected to the clients local time. eg- I get Australian Time without having to do the calculation in my head as to how far away the next battle is - very nice feature! <BR> <BR>-Monsters no longer get shortened careers from training with low energy.  <BR> <BR>-Recovery rate of energy has increased. <BR> <BR>-The effect of favoured food is now working. That is, if a monsters favourite food is meat, when you feed it the shop meet it will gain 15 energy not 10 &#40;from the 50% favourite bonus&#41;. <BR> <BR>-The new adventure area Abigan Ruins is open. Not sure on the level restrictions or area specific skills required... seems like a place any monster can go. <BR> <BR>-The &#34;Skip Round&#34; option in battle now pauses at the final compared stat number instead of skipping the round completely. Very nice if you want to know what stat you narrowly lost on so you can change strategy. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve noticed that monsters generally live longer due to the training change. I no longer have any trouble breaking the 3 year mark with monsters. <BR> <BR>I have a feeling, but I&#39;m not quite sure, that there might be a change to combining that includes more techs in the combination. I combined 2 monsters with 5 techs and the result had 4. Previously the result would have 3... so this is quite good if it is the case.

 Since it hasn&#39;t been posted yet, it&#39;s probably worth noting that stats are not capped at 999.   <BR> <BR>Also worth noting is that combining with neighbors results in a new monster with substantially lower stats &#40;something in the neighborhood of level 11-12 instead of 13-14&#41; than if the second monster had been one of your own of a similar rank.  However, combining a freshly &#40;disk&#41; generated monster at one year old with a neighbor&#39;s monster of higher level is a quick way to increase stats &#40;although you risk ending up with a different monster, of course&#41; and potentially get rare monsters.

 Oh, a derp is me, Jailkeepers are Golem x Zan, not Joker.  <BR>Looks like the search is on again. <BR> <BR>Should we start compiling a list of baseline stats &#40;and  <BR>descriptions to go&#41;, should they be of any use? I&#39;ll help type  <BR>them up if ever :D <BR> <BR>By the way, some of the descriptions are cut off by the text  <BR>box size on my phone &#40;e.g. Gobi &#91;Golem x Henger&#93;: &#34;There  <BR>are also rumors of &#60;cut&#62;&#34;&#41;, does anyone have it in full?

 Yes, baselines and descriptions would be very useful. I&#39;ll start a new thread for it.

 I stumbled across something neat: <BR> <BR>From what I can tell, the probability of getting a monster in &#34;Neighbor&#34; combination doesn&#39;t affect the overall stats of that monster.  The overall stats are, however, affected by two things &#40;other than items and the stats of the parents&#41;: <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41; There is a minor variation in total stats that I would guess is due to rounding in individual stats - this results in differences of &#40;that I&#39;ve seen&#41; no more than 2 total points one way or the other.  My guess is that &#34;noise&#34; differences of more than 5 points is incredibly unlikely. <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41; It appears that rare creatures get a stat boost of 100 total points. This is only for the rare creature outcome, &#40;requiring a rare creature parent&#41;. I&#39;ve recorded the situation twice and observed 100 point differences twice, so while coincidence can&#39;t be ruled out, I suspect 100 points is the rule.  The &#42;only&#42; time that I&#39;ve seen more than the minor variations in &#40;1&#41; is when the resulting creature is/would be rare.

 This business of dumping every new tidbit in one long thread doesn&#39;t help me and it doesn&#39;t help players find any information. <BR> <BR>Take a look at the MR2 FAQ section and follow that by posting new threads in Misc Q&amp;A entitled &#34;temporary thread for XYZ&#34; then start compiling data on a subject like techs, or exploring, or whatever, there <BR> <BR>This thread was JUST asking what sections to set up so everyone could post information appropriately in those sections. I usually have deleted this sort of thread by this stage in the release cycle because the sections are created. <BR> <BR>So far, I have lists of trivia and no idea what main sections to make and no threads to move to them if I were make the sections. <BR> <BR>If anyone wants the info posted above to be archived, re-work it so it&#39;s a decent post on its own, and start a new message thread for it. I am locking this and will delete it in a few days since I clearly will not get a response to my original request.
