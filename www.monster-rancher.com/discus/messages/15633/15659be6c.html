 Baseline order will be: Pow/Int/Ski/Spd/Def/Lif. <BR> <BR>Suezo placeholder &#40;10 total, 2 rare&#41;: <BR> <BR>Suezo &#40;Suezo x Suezo&#41;: <BR>Description: This is the pure breed of Suezo, a monster with  <BR>one gigantic eye. Often considered to be the &#34;face&#34; of  <BR>Monster Rancher, Suezo is a selfish creature which likes to  <BR>play pranks. <BR>Baseline: 120/120/130/95/90/95 <BR> <BR>Hornie &#40;Suezo x Tiger&#41;: <BR>Description: This is a breed of Suezo with Tiger DNA, bearing  <BR>a distinctive horn on its forehead. It has an air of seriousness  <BR>which is quite unusual for a Suezo. <BR>Baseline: 113/117/128/112/87/93 <BR> <BR>Eyebee &#40;Suezo x Beaclon&#41;: <BR>Description: This is a breed of Suezo with Beaclon DNA. At  <BR>first glance, its insect-like eye might make it seem creepy, but  <BR>it has a mysterious charm which has earned it a recent boom  <BR>in popularity. <BR>Baseline: 127/103/115/102/102/102 <BR> <BR>Fuzako &#40;Suezo x Lesione&#41;: <BR>Description: This is a breed of Suezo with Lesione DNA. On  <BR>the surface it is rather meek and obedient, but deep down it  <BR>feels it is the greatest of the Suezos. <BR>Baseline: 120/120/117/87/98/108 <BR> <BR>Baseball Boy &#40;Suezo x ???&#41;: <BR>Description: This is a very rare breed of Suezo, which for  <BR>whatever reason evolved to resemble a baseball. It is  <BR>unusually competitive, making it a harder worker than most  <BR>Suezos. <BR>Baseline: 140/120/170/90/115/115 <BR> <BR>&#40;sadly, I&#39;ve only collected 5. Some of the missing subs  <BR>theoretically include Naga, Dragon, Pixie, Golem, OR Hare,  <BR>plus another rare, in case anyone else wants to help try  <BR>further combinations, but it should be easier to just keep  <BR>searching for other trainers who have Suezo types.&#41;

 &#40;Suezo addendum: Sueki Suezo is the other rare, but its disk  <BR>costs... an impossibly high amount. I won&#39;t be getting the info  <BR>for it too soon. Sorry.&#41;

 Gack! Haven&#39;t updated in forever, I&#39;ve been really busy with  <BR>school. <BR> <BR>BTW, some word processors have find-and-replace functions,  <BR>right? Maybe you can use that? Again, I can probably help  <BR>with formatting if the need arises.

 I am slowly working on this project. I have decided to have the chart show the subs in alphabetical order by sub-breed, with rares at the end. I think that it&#39;s an overall more consistent way to display the info than alphabetical by breed name. If anyone has a compelling reason to change it, please let me know.

 Sorry about formatting issues, I can&#39;t get it to  <BR>straighten out. And a lot of the descriptions are  <BR>translated weird.

Liveriz is getting more  <BR>and more popular with women for its fluff like an  <BR>angel and lovely smile. Doesn&#39;t really like to be  <BR>considered the little too peaceful Beata.&#34; <BR>Pow- 113 <BR>Int- 102 <BR>Ski- 85 <BR>Spd- 107 <BR>Def- 123 <BR>Lif- 120 <BR> <BR>Tanuta <BR>Beata/??? <BR>&#34;A rare Beata DNA.
