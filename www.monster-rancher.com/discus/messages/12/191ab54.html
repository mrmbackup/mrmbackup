I can&#39;t seem to get any monster to have loyalty any higher than 60 and most seem to stay around 50. how do you get it to 100?  <BR> <BR>-- Jeff &#40;<A HREF="mailto:nemesis_7777@yahoo.com">nemesis_7777@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, December 06, 1999  <BR> <BR>change the style from soft &#40;which you are probably at now&#41; to EVEN by using Smoked snakes and  don&#39;t reward him much  <BR> <BR>-- tyson &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ttyson6@hotmail.com">ttyson6@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, December 06, 1999.  <BR> <BR>There are a few ways to do it.  <BR>1.Keep the monster&#39;s status at even. you have to feed it a smoked snake when its status is not even. The loyalty of monsters with even status will rise but the loyalty of monsters that are spoiled will drop.  <BR>2.Feed magic bananas.The loyalty might rise and might drop.  <BR> <BR>-- Stan &#40;<A HREF="mailto:psycho_stan@hotmail.com">psycho_stan@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, December 06, 1999.  <BR> <BR>The increase in LOY comes at a price for bananas. When LOY goes down one week is added to lifespan, and the opposite is true for an increase in LOY  <BR> <BR>-- Golden Boy &#40;<A HREF="mailto:chrisbee@exploremaine.com">chrisbee@exploremaine.com</A>&#41;, December 06, 1999.  <BR> <BR>don&#39;t be afraid to withhold praise and to scold at any time your monster fails to acheive maximum results. this, combined with nuts oil and tablet, gets me into the 80s and 90s in loy w/o snakes.  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, December 06, 1999.  <BR> <BR>If your monster has between 50 and 60 loyalty I&#39;m willing to bet that its style is at Doting. You might try feeding it some Sour Jellies. Also do you feed it meat or give it what it asks for when it completes a tournament? You might try feeding it Cup Jellies and and rewarding it after battles unless they win an end of the month one or if they win an important one. Also be sure to scold them when they do wrong, though depending on your monster&#39;s age, it may be too late to change its attitude, as the way you raise it in its formative years will affect how the monster thinks what the right way to do things is.  <BR> <BR>-- El_Buttweasle &#40;<A HREF="mailto:el_buttweasle@yahoo.com">el_buttweasle@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, December 06, 1999.  <BR> <BR>I have an idea for you. Get a new monster and be a total jerk to it for the first 8 months. Make sure that your style is HARSH. Afetr doing this most monsters loyalty will rise to around 40-50 for those first few months. Slowly back off and give them more and more leeway. Your monsters actually look at this as a reward and begin to raise their loyalty even higher. I have a few monsters with loyalty levels very close to 100. just by using this technique. Some monsters are just easier to work with.  <BR>I ty to stay away from pixies. They suck, especially when it comes to loyalty. They are just like women. ^_^  <BR> <BR>-- Dinoslice &#40;<A HREF="mailto:sigpichong@hotmail.com">sigpichong@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, December 06, 1999.  <BR> <BR>Loyalty -  <BR>Loyalty is comprised of two 50 point categories: Fear/Respect and Dependence/Love. It is easy to get a monster’s loyalty to 50 by treating it horribly all the time, or by being lenient with it all the time. In order to get the rest of the way to 100, you must treat it to both Respect and Love you.  <BR>If you prefer a spartan raising method, once your monster reaches 50 loyalty, periodically be nice to it. It’s loyalty will immediately drop, to reflect your monster’s loss of respect for you, but you will have gained a few points of love, and when you return to your normal harsh style, its loyalty will rise above 50 as you gain back the fear points. If you prefer a kind style of raising, simply scold your monster when the occasion merits it, or feed it a food it doesn’t like &#40;bearing in mind the stress this causes&#41;. You will immediately lose total loyalty points, but your monster will gain respect for you, and when you return to your ordinary kind breeding style, your monster will end by having a higher total loyalty within a couple weeks. The key is to understand that many actions you take have a complex effect on your monster’s loyalty, and you might not see the net gain or loss of an action until a few weeks later.  <BR> <BR>-- Lao &#40;<A HREF="mailto:darklao@hotmail.com">darklao@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, December 07, 1999.
