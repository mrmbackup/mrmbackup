<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>RNA</B> on <B>Tuesday, April 18, 2000 - 01:40 am</B>:</FONT><P>
I was browsing the message board at Fade&#39;s site &#40;<A HREF="../../../index.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.monster-rancher.com/</A>&#41; and came across something interesting. Besides the fact that alot of messages were apparently deleted from some sort of change, I also stumbled upon a thread that talked about techs related specifically to certain subbreeds of monsters. The experiment is currently being investigated by Richard Ryley and others. He also metioned something about this in the thread &#34;attack chains continued&#34; from the &#34;raising/training&#34; category but nobody replied to his posts.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s what I found out: I will use the Pixie as an example.  <BR> <BR>All of pixie&#39;s moves &#40;taken from monster haven - <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Maze/6761/mhaven.htm" TARGET="_top">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Maze/6761/mhaven.htm</A>&#41;:  <BR> <BR>&#40;g&#41; = good &#40;e&#41; = evil  <BR> <BR>Longest range: flame, gigaflame&#40;e&#41;, ray, megaray, gigaray&#40;g&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Long range: bolt, lightning, kiss, lifesteal&#40;e&#41;, refreshment&#40;g&#41;, fire breath.  <BR> <BR>Close range: bang, big bang, 1-2 punch, phantom claw, death final.  <BR> <BR>Closest range: pat, slap, kick, high kick, heel raid.  <BR> <BR>Notice anything strange?  <BR> <BR>These are predicted technique chains: pat -&#62; slap, kick -&#62; high kick -&#62; heel raid, bang -&#62; big bang, bolt -&#62; lightning, flame -&#62; gigaflame&#40;e&#41;, ray -&#62; megaray -&#62; gigaray&#40;g&#41;.  <BR> <BR>While these are good and evil attacks acquired by just being the right alignment: refreshment&#40;g&#41;, life steal&#40;e&#41;.  <BR> <BR>So what about these attacks: fire breath, 1-2 punch, phantom claw, and death final? Don&#39;t they sound familiar?  <BR> <BR>Fire breath is a move that a Dragon has, 1-2 punch is a move that a Hare has, phantom claw is a move that a Kato has, and Death final is a move that a Joker has.  <BR> <BR>Here is the initial theory: Only a Daina&#40;Pixie/Dragon&#41; can obtain &#34;fire breath,&#34; only a Lepus&#40;pixie/hare&#41; can obtain &#34;1-2 punch,&#34; only a Kitten&#40;pixie/kato&#41; can obtain &#34;phantom claw,&#34; and only a Lilim&#40;Pixie/Joker&#41; can obtain &#34;death final.&#34;  <BR> <BR>It seems quite logical, doesn&#39;t it? If this is true, then we are faced with a much more difficult task to unlock &#34;all&#34; of your monster&#39;s techs. Now there are three things to consider in order to unlock a tech:  <BR> <BR>1&#41; use a tech 30-50 times in hopes of it unlocking the next in its chain.  <BR> <BR>2&#41; use a COMBINATION of 2 or more techs 30-50 times&#40;each&#41; in hopes of unlocking the next in its &#34;crossover&#34; chain.  <BR> <BR>3&#41; make sure you are the right subbreed. To get the existing techs, use method 1&#41; or 2&#41; or by simply going to an errantry without the need to unlock.  <BR> <BR>Case studies of certain breed specific monsters gives compelling evidence that this theory is valid. HOWEVER, no information has been attained as to whether or not these techs can be inherited to a next generation of the same main breed but of different sub breed.  <BR> <BR>The credit for this work should be given to those individuals at Fade&#39;s message board. Since there is no such information on this board, I thought it would be helpful to bring over this information so that others can evaluate this as well. I do not wish to register&#40;as required&#41; to fade&#39;s message board so I did not ask them more questions on this topic. However, it would be helpful if the members of fade&#39;s board could come over here and enlighten us more with such a newly discovered subject.  <BR> <BR>Please give your comments in regard to this. Any examples of your monster breeds attaining techs often seen in other monsters are helpful. Maybe someone can conduct an experiment to see if these breed specific techs cross over to the next generation monster of a different sub breed.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, December 19, 1999  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Yes it is curious. I always wondered why Kitty &#40;the A class Pixie/Kato&#41; had the phanton claw move when no other pixie did. Apparently some sub-breeds have crossover techs.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 19, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I also noticed my Priarocks &#40;arrowhead/golem&#41; learned that cyclone move that usually is learned by only Golems. He is the only Arrowhead i&#39;ve seen use that move.  <BR> <BR>-- Eric Smith &#40;<A HREF="mailto:sageofthehalo11@aol.com">sageofthehalo11@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 19, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>The F-Class Lepus kept using 1-2 punch and I was actually thinking of typing it up but RNA beat me to the punch.  <BR> <BR>-- Zack &#40;<A HREF="mailto:belgrath16@aol.com">belgrath16@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 19, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>do you know on what erentry gigaflame is lernd on my brother does not know how to get it and he left his usuel training methods to get his PIXIE evel it would be nice if you could find the time to anwser me thank you  <BR> <BR>-- Sterling Routson Thomas &#40;<A HREF="mailto:creeky@gateway.net">creeky@gateway.net</A>&#41;, December 19, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s a heavy technique, get it on the Mandy Desert Errantry. And what does that question have to do with Breed Specific Technique Chains?  <BR> <BR>-- Zack &#40;<A HREF="mailto:belgrath16@aol.com">belgrath16@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 19, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>SORRY and yes I beleve that there are breed specific techs aspin has used flame and lightning on me to many times I also herd that hopper/katos can lern phantom claw also pink katos can lern licking so yes I am shure there are breed specific techs and thank you  <BR> <BR>-- Sterling Routson Thomas &#40;<A HREF="mailto:creeky@gateway.net">creeky@gateway.net</A>&#41;, December 19, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>i was WONDERING about that. funny you should bring up the pixie stuff... i&#39;m raising my first pixie &#40;didn&#39;t even raise one in mr1&#41;... it&#39;s a pixie/joker and it picked up death final. cool beans. this is getting more interesting all the time.  <BR> <BR>-- shoeshine &#40;<A HREF="mailto:stinky@famvid.com">stinky@famvid.com</A>&#41;, December 19, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Hm... a question to anyone who&#39;s gotten these attacks: which errantry did you get them on? I&#39;d like to try to pursue this and see what I can get. If EVERY mixed-breed monster has a sub-breed attack... wow, that certain makes each monster more unique. Congrats to RNA and those who found out about this :&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- Bill Mick &#40;<A HREF="mailto:otterzero@hotmail.com">otterzero@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, December 20, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Hmm...my Citronie &#40;Kato/Suezo&#41; also got Licking as one of its first moves. So, this brings up a few interesting questions: Can you get cross-over moves on the variety-deprived creatures like Joker? Having a Hell Heart pull out some Pixie spells or a Blue Terror pulling out Tiger spells would ROCK....not to mention an Odium with Bajarl&#39;s drain moves....OOOOOOOOH......  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 21, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m assuming these moves are either in the POW, SPD or DEF errantries as I&#39;ve cleaned out the moves for the other errantries with my pixie.  <BR>I don&#39;t think EVERY subbreed has a special move. I think only 4 pixie subbreeds have special moves.  <BR> <BR>However, there was an example on fade&#39;s board where someone talked about a &#40;tiger/monol&#41; having a &#34;1-2 punch&#34; &#40;hare&#39;s move&#41;. I&#39;m not sure how it got that. Maybe from inheritance? Maybe its just a move that all tigers learn? I don&#39;t know.  <BR> <BR>I want to raise a Lilim&#40;pixie/joker&#41;. It&#39;s death final is deadly &#40;A damage, A wither&#41;. I wonder if it looks the same as joker&#39;s death final.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, December 21, 1999.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>No. Variety deprived monsters like the joker cannot get breed specific techs because it only has 6 different moves. To find out how many moves a monster has, you&#39;ll need to check out someone&#39;s movelist. The reason why no tech list out there is complete yet, is probably because of monsters with breed specific techs. But then again, why don&#39;t they just use gameshark to find out?  <BR>Example: A pixie could not learn say, &#34;zilla rush&#34; because it is not even a possible move listed in its tech list.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, December 21, 1999.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Tigers already have a 1-2 punch attack. They also had it in MR1.  <BR> <BR>-- Zack &#40;<A HREF="mailto:belgrath16@aol.com">belgrath16@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 23, 1999.
