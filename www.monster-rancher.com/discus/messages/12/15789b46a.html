 Hi, long time lurker, first time poster. Long story short I decided to delete my original hacked-to-death save and unlock every single monster type fair and square. <BR> <BR>Currently I&#39;m training a HoundSaurian which will then be combined with my pure Gaboo; thing is, my Gaboo has just about every tech there is except the specials &#40;&#39;cause those aren&#39;t carried over anyway&#41; and Long Straight &#40;because I plan to learn that one and get the Zilla beard at the same time&#41; BUT, my HoundSaurian only has Jumping Claw and Charge. <BR> <BR>My question is, since the Pure Gaboo has so many techs and the Tiger-sub has so few, would the resulting Frozen Gaboo have an average of both, or worse, just as few techs as the Tiger-sub?

 There&#39;s some randomness to it. Save your game before combining and see what happens a few times, if you have the patience.

 You should most definitely use the Gaboo as the main breed to combine with. In my experience, if the main breed of the parent combination and the baby have the same main breed, the techs to be passed down are going to be both random and plentiful for the baby.

 Thank you for the feedback guys. Hopefully I won&#39;t lose Electric Blow, Straight, nor Shockwave despite using my HoundSaurian with just 2 &#40;possibly 3 or 4 tops&#41; techs for combining. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m really paranoid about the whole deal due to my HoundSaurian getting just Charge from his parents &#40;a pure Zuum with 2 techs and a Hopper/Tiger with just 1 tech&#41;. <BR> <BR>What can I say, the blue Zuum&#39;s only goals in life are making me a bunch of gold and beating the S rank if possible. Unlocking techs would just waste time and effort better spent on those things. However if my Gaboo will lose all his techs after combining then I might as well work the blue Zuum into the ground for as much techs as possible.

 I find that you will at least get 2 basic moves and 1 of each from the Sharp/Heavy/Withering/Hit tech types for the baby if you already had at least one of the parents learn at least one tech from each errantry besides Kawrea &#40;said &#34;at least&#34;.. at least three times there, and now one more for the counter&#41;. This becomes the standard tech set-up if you use the parent that doesn&#39;t have the same main breed as the resulting baby you want &#40;in your case, the Hound Saurian&#41; as the first parent of the combo.  <BR> <BR>tl;dr - You should have at least six techs if you combine for a Gaboo baby without regard. I definitely suggest to use the Gaboo parent as the first parent for your future combining though. <BR> <BR>Just checked if the number of techs of the second parent really matters or not, and the answer seems to say no. I combined a Dragon/Pixie and a Henger/Golem, with both learning all the techs they can, and produced a baby Dragon/Henger with about 12 starting techs. I reloaded and used the same Dragon/Pixie parent again and combined it with a fresh-off-the-market Zuum, and the resulting baby Dragon/Pixie from the combo also had 12 starting techs. So it seems to me that you&#39;re pretty much good to go with your set-up.
