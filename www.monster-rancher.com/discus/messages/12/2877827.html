You can feed more than 30 cup jellies, 30 is the minimum. <BR>It must never have been stressed. The real trick here is to manage the stress against the spoiling.  <BR>First of all, check your monter&#39;s form. If it&#39;s skinny or slim, feed candy. If it&#39;s fat give it powder. This will help it not get stressed too easily. Check the form at least once a month. I got a worm from a CD whose starting form was skinny. I fed one candy during each of it&#39;s two first weeks on the ranch and it stayed at a normal weight for about a year, returning to skinny as a chronic condition. Managing stress also means making sure your monster gets enough rest. I like about 1 week of rest for each 3 weeks of work. Don&#39;t send them on expeditions, there&#39;s just no point in risking them for a few items. I always send them on errantry during week 1, so they get fed regularly. If I know they&#39;ll be going on errantry, I always rest them the week before &#40;week 4 of prior month&#41; and feed both nuts oil and mint just before sending them. I would only send the worm on a maximum of 3 errantries, the first at about 1 year of age. I also held back on battles, waiting until I was sure the worm&#39;s stats were high enough to win easily. As always, save right before a battle so you can reset in case of injury. <BR>The spoiling part is where most ranchers fall down. The cup jellies slightly spoil the monsters, so after a few months you&#39;re style can shift from even to fond without any instances of praise and this affects loyalty. Too much spoiling and your loyalty won&#39;t get over 55. The trick is to start feeding the smoked snake as your syle gets more &#34;fond&#34;. I found that mint and snake together seem to work well, and had a 12 point loyalty jump once at the first feeding of the combo at about one and a half years of age. The last two years of my worm&#39;s life as a worm had me rotating feeding mint, snakes, candy, nuts oil &#40;he kept asking for it&#41;, and the occasional mango at least once a month, sometimes using items every two weeks. My loyalty was at 90 very quickly and once raised would only fluctuate from 98-94, never dropping below 92 and I never had stress or spoiling. <BR>Hope this helps!

 It took me three tries, although I did use my &#34;failures&#34; in combination to get a better final monster. I did wind up discarding one combo where the offspring hated cup jellies, that seemed just WAY too hard!

I can NEVER be stressed. This one is hard! Try looking at Dark Phoenix&#39;s posts in the items section, one in the Item Shop section about items, the other about food. I didn&#39;t get my beaclon until I understood this info. &#40;starting with a skinny monster didn&#39;t help either, but it was a choice between that one and one that hated cup jelly...&#41;

 I have to disagree with that one, Lisa. My worm got stressed for short periods of time, I&#39;m certain of it. I just cured it as quickly as it came up, and I was able to get the Beaclon out. It can&#39;t be spoiled or stressed at the time that it&#39;s hatching, I know that much, but I&#39;m almost positive that my successful try was stressed once in its youth. I just upped the mint leaves, and it never happened again. <BR> <BR>I think the main reason it can&#39;t get spoiled and stressed is that it has to live for 4 years, and spoil/stress can easily lower that lifespan. Especially stress.

 I had a Worm that did not hatch that had the spoil warning once in year 1, everything else was ok. I didn&#39;t have any experience with the stress side, I was feeding lots of mint, mango, and nuts oil. <BR>Back when Tecmo had the mini-guide on their website, it said no spoiling and no stress, then 30 cup jellies, then the very in the week of... <BR>Anyway, this is a monster that can be difficult to get. I suspect that starting form can be a big factor.

 I always thought if you froze the worm it would not coacoon. but then my worm didnt caccon. does it have to be born in june or any special time at all? Mine was born on agust week 2 and became 4 yrs 10 months didnt caccon and had the stress warning 2 tims in those 4 years. it when on one errintry. he is still going strong though so I am going to keep raising him his life power skill and def are all over 500 he is the best worm I have had. but not the best monster.

 Freezing the monster has been proven not to keep then from transforming. In your case, your worm may have been stressed at the time it was supposed to coccoon, which is why it didn&#39;t.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no special time &#40;that I know of&#41; that it has to be born, though it will only cocoon in... summer, I think it is? Or am I remembering wrong? Mind&#39;s hazy on Beaclon-details today.

 Pardon the double-posting, but a couple questions I suddenly thought to ask: <BR> <BR>1&#41; What is the worm&#39;s present loyalty? It needs to be 80 or above. <BR> <BR>2&#41; What have you been feednig it? <BR> <BR>3&#41; What is its current level? A worm has to be rank D or lower &#40;some people say &#39;C&#39;, but I go &#39;D&#39; for safety&#41; to coccoon.

 DemonKnight, you might send it on a few errantries to pick up some techs. Since it&#39;s in its prime right now, it&#39;ll do well on errantry. That way, if you freeze it to make another monster, you&#39;ll get some carry-over. I raised two unsuccessful worms from CDs, then combined them to make a much better worm. I was really glad I&#39;d sent the parents on the errantries, because my second generation started out far ahead of anything off a CD. Don&#39;t forget, you must feed at least 30 cup jelly, and never get the spoil warning. &#40;&#34;I guess it depends on us too much&#34;&#41;

 well, I got a beaclon on my first try without even trying hard I didn&#39;t know it had all those requirements...I just grew it straight from baby to 4yrs 5mo. w/ an occasional nuts oil and it was strong enough to be an S class monster when it hatched......the sucky thing is..I have no cds w/ beaclon sub or main...I also have no cds for zilla, ghost, and naga.....

 Its loyalty was between 98-100 its style was even almost the entire time except for a few times when it went to fond and then to stric when I gave it a snake. it got the stress warning two time when it was 1yr 4mnths and agin at 2 years. I gave it jelly one month and the next month i gave it tablet. Maybe I missed a jelly or somthing. it has been on 2 errentrys now. but only one was during the time I was trying to get beaclon, the other was just to get a new move to use for battle because now he is going to be just another monster that will hopefuly make me a new worm to become the beclon.

 Does it need to enter the battle on the 4th week of June?  I&#39;ve had six unsuccessful worm breeds &#40;3 of whom ended up having the &#39;spoil&#39; problem while I figured out how to boost loyalty&#41;.  I usually have the loyalty up around 82-84, and they&#39;re always listed as very well on the fourth week of June.  I have also kept them stress-free, and fed them nothing but cup jellies.  I have them advanced to only D class.  Their ability scores usually even out around 200-250, with life up and into the 600s.  Any ideas?

 Um... Hi? I haven&#39;t said much but I&#39;ve been reading the posts... and I was wondering... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m confused as to what to do. Some places say to never battle, never errantry, and only light drills but never let it get tired. <BR> <BR>But here there are people actually battling and using errantry! AND then there&#39;s this talk of it never being spoiled... <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t understand... which way is the correct way? I&#39;ve been trying... <BR> <BR>My Worm is 3 years and 11 months. It turns 4 in one week. I had a bad feeling about my worm so I saved before it turned 4 &#40;Its Birthday is June 1&#41;. Anyway... I went to June 4... and nothing happened! <BR> <BR>What did I do wrong? I fed it Star Prunes so it&#39;d have 100 fame &#40;costly @.@&#41;... fed it nothing but cup jellies... never battled it, never went on errantry... and I used a light drill once a week to increase its health.

 The Beaclon doesn&#39;t need fame at all &#40;I created one with a worm who never battled in the least&#41;. It needs to be even, never be spoiled, never be stressed &#40;although I&#39;m wondering about that... but assume, just in case&#41;, needs to have a loyalty &#40;not fame&#41; of 80&#43;, and needs to be fed at least 50 cup jellies. <BR> <BR>Other than this, I really can&#39;t suggest what it needs.  <BR> <BR>Oh, and yes. You can send the worm on errantries. So long as you don&#39;t let it get too stressed out, and make sure it&#39;s rested &#40;that could&#39;ve been the problem&#41; on June 1st.

 Scold, not always give them want they want and use Smoked Snakes. Those are 3 ways of not getting your monster spoiled. <BR> <BR>For myself, I don&#39;t scold because I want bad natured monsters, and I give them what they want because I&#39;m just too nice. So I use lots of Smoked Snakes.

 You probably shouldn&#39;t give it at all. It can make your loyalty take a dive, plus by the time she says it it&#39;s really too late, and there are no warning signs. The only way to do it is to prevent it from getting spoiled at all. Like he said, scold them when they do anything wrong, and don&#39;t always give them what they want.

It may very well be, unfortunately. Try giving it another year and see what happens, although I&#39;d say you&#39;ll need to make a new worm and try again. <BR> <BR>If your creature is spoiled, the easiest way to tell is by seeing how long it&#39;s been &#39;soft&#39; or above. If it&#39;s been there for over a week straight, then it&#39;s spoiled &#40;at least, that&#39;s how I could always tell with mine&#41;. Plus, at the beginning of a new week, Colt&#39;ll say &#39;We&#39;re spoiling it too much&#39; or &#39; depends on us too much. I guess we spoiled it.&#39;  <BR> <BR>As for scolding them when they do something wrong, do so, but watch out for them to get &#39;strict&#39;. That&#39;ll keep their loyalty at a level much like &#39;soft&#39; will. Don&#39;t keep them &#39;strict&#39; for too long, either.  <BR> <BR>Might wanna combine that worm away into something else &#40;even a newborn&#41; and get a new worm with multiple starting moves. At the very least, it&#39;ll give you a little boost. <BR> <BR>As for being a newbie... we were all there once. Some of us, not so long ago.

 I&#39;ve frozen it and revived it in May twice... and it still won&#39;t coccoon. So I guess I&#39;ll have to just toss it on some errantries, and then combine it.

 Just a quick question...Is the randomness determined at the beginning of a worms life or at the point of supposed transformation?  Like if you saved it the week before June the 4th, and continued to reset and attempt it again, would it make a difference or is it preordained from the beginning of the worms life?

 We suspect, and I&#39;m just going on word from people I have talked to, that somehow it&#39;s set at the beginning. I seem to recall people talking about how they tried multiple resets from two months before &#40;in an attempt to get the &#34;Very Well&#34; part correct&#41; and it didn&#39;t work. &#40;If they just had a tired monster it worked.&#41; But, it would probably be useful for more people to reply to this question.
