 After having raised a couple of generations of wrackys, I&#39;ve finally got to  <BR>the stage where I&#39;m raising what will hopefully be the final one. Excluding  <BR>the special chains, which as far as I know don&#39;t carry over, and spin slash,  <BR>which was being buggy and unobtainable on his parents but I&#39;ve now acquired,  <BR>I&#39;d unlocked every chain. At first I raised a tricker, which unlocked blast  <BR>shot amongst others, but when I combined that into a metal glay, every single  <BR>tech I&#39;d unlocked excluding blast shot was available to me. I&#39;d already  <BR>noticed that spin slash was playing up at this point so I decided to breed  <BR>into a pure wracky to see if it was just this particular monster that was the  <BR>problem, and now everything works fine except blast shot is still locked as  <BR>difficult. Having looked over the requirements for everything else I&#39;ve tried  <BR>every other possibility I can think of: <BR> <BR>-Tested nature from best through to worst, including neutral <BR>-Tested with 700 Int/800 Pow so I can&#39;t see that being a problem <BR>-In one of my combinations I didn&#39;t keep it carried over into a baby so I  <BR>can&#39;t see it not carrying over <BR> <BR>As a side note when I did acquire it I had a tricker with ~500 Int at bad  <BR>nature <BR> <BR>Wracky combo is also currently locked to me, although I haven&#39;t had time to  <BR>check nature yet it isn&#39;t listed as a requirement so I thought that this might  <BR>be chained from an earlier tech &#40;Weapon combo maybe?&#41; Any ideas? <BR> <BR>Finally I kept track of all the tech requirements as I unlocked them, here are  <BR>the numbers I&#39;ve got so far if you want to add them in: <BR> <BR>Stats:  <BR> <BR>Head Spike=350 Int. <BR>Flame=450 Int. <BR> <BR>Nature: <BR> <BR>Explosion=Evil Nature &#40;You need to be worse than just bad but not quite worst,  <BR>also there&#39;s no power requirement, I got it at 6 power&#41; <BR>Spin Slash= Good nature &#40;Only twister slash is listed as being good&#41; <BR> <BR>Chains: <BR> <BR>Weapon&#42;30 -&#62; Weapon Combo  <BR>Air Shot&#42;50 -&#62; Blast Shot  <BR>Kick&#42;50 -&#62; Spin Kick&#42;50 -&#62; Twister Kick  <BR>Punch&#42;50 -&#62; Heavy Punch  <BR>Necromancy&#42;0 -&#62; Trick  <BR> <BR>The fact you don&#39;t need to use necromancy suggests to me it&#39;s like Sneak  <BR>Attack and Sneak Combo, not necessarily a chain, just difficult to obtain the  <BR>more powerful move first. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll also post here and update the rest of the chains once I begin to unlock  <BR>the final few.

 The tech chart info was compiled from a large group of people submitting info that has, over time, turned out to be mostly right but sometimes not quite on target. It&#39;s been years since I raised a wracky, so I don&#39;t have an answer for you.  <BR> <BR>Thanks for posting what you have, it&#39;s always good to get confirmation on these things.

I still don&#39;t have a clue what&#39;s locking blast shot, but I&#39;ve managed every other chain. The  <BR>only things I can&#39;t confirm are fire juggler as I&#39;ve never raised a draco doll and the int/pow  <BR>requirements, as I had over the listed amounts every time I could unlock one; I&#39;ve just  <BR>reposted those as they are now. <BR> <BR>Complete Wracky Move List: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Name</TD><TD>Type</TD><TD>Range</TD><TD>Guts</TD><TD>Stats</TD><TD>Nature</TD><TD>Notes </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Weapon</FONT></TD><TD>Basic</TD><TD>Short</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>E/A/E/-</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>a </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="119911">Weapon Throw</FONT></TD><TD>Basic</TD><TD>Far</TD><TD>12</TD><TD>D/A/E/-</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>a </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Weapon Combo</FONT></TD><TD>Basic</TD><TD>Short</TD><TD>20</TD><TD>D/A/D/-</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Kick</FONT></TD><TD>Hit</TD><TD>Short</TD><TD>28</TD><TD>D/S/E/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Spin Kick</FONT></TD><TD>Hit</TD><TD>Short</TD><TD>33</TD><TD>C/S/D/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Twister Kick</FONT></TD><TD>Special</TD><TD>Short</TD><TD>45</TD><TD>B/S/D/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Punch</FONT></TD><TD>Heavy</TD><TD>Short</TD><TD>18</TD><TD>C/D/D/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Heavy Punch</FONT></TD><TD>Heavy</TD><TD>Mid</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>C/D/D/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Wracky Combo</FONT></TD><TD>Special</TD><TD>Mid</TD><TD>50</TD><TD>A/E/A/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>b </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="119911">Necromancy</FONT></TD><TD>Withering</TD><TD>Mid</TD><TD>20</TD><TD>E/C/C/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="119911">Trick</FONT></TD><TD>Withering</TD><TD>Far</TD><TD>32</TD><TD>E/C/A/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Sneak Attack</FONT></TD><TD>Sharp</TD><TD>Mid</TD><TD>16</TD><TD>D/B/E/C</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Sneak Combo</FONT></TD><TD>Sharp</TD><TD>Mid</TD><TD>42</TD><TD>C/B/D/A</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Spin Slash</FONT></TD><TD>Heavy</TD><TD>Far</TD><TD>28</TD><TD>B/D/E/D</TD><TD>Good</TD><TD>c<SUB>1</SUB> </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Twister Slash</FONT></TD><TD>Heavy</TD><TD>Extreme</TD><TD>39</TD><TD>A/D/E/D</TD><TD>Good</TD><TD>c<SUB>2</SUB> </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Explosion</FONT></TD><TD>Special</TD><TD>Far</TD><TD>50</TD><TD>S/E/S/D</TD><TD>Bad</TD><TD>d </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="119911">Head Spike</FONT></TD><TD>Special</TD><TD>Far</TD><TD>45</TD><TD>C/C/B/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>e </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="119911">Fire Spike</FONT></TD><TD>Special</TD><TD>Far</TD><TD>50</TD><TD>B/D/A/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="119911">Air Shot</FONT></TD><TD>Hit</TD><TD>Extreme</TD><TD>17</TD><TD>E/S/E/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="119911">Blast Shot</FONT></TD><TD>Hit</TD><TD>Extreme</TD><TD>28</TD><TD>C/S/D/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Beat Dance</FONT></TD><TD>Special</TD><TD>Extreme</TD><TD>50</TD><TD>C/C/C/A</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Cursed Dance</FONT></TD><TD>Special</TD><TD>Extreme</TD><TD>55</TD><TD>B/C/B/S</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="119911">Flame</FONT></TD><TD>Special</TD><TD>Extreme</TD><TD>50</TD><TD>A/D/A/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>f </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="119911">Fire Juggler</FONT></TD><TD>Special</TD><TD>Mid</TD><TD>50</TD><TD>S/D/C/E</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>g</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR><B>Tech Chains:</B> <BR> <BR>Weapon &#40;30&#41; -&#62; Weapon Combo <BR>Air Shot &#40;50&#41; -&#62; Blast Shot <BR>Kick &#40;50&#41; -&#62; Spin Kick &#40;50&#41; -&#62; Twister Kick <BR>Punch &#40;50&#41; -&#62; Heavy Punch &#40;50&#41; -&#62; Wracky Combo <BR>Beat Dance &#40;50&#41; -&#62; Cursed Dance <BR>Head Spike &#40;50&#41; -&#62; Fire Spike <BR>Spin Slash &#40;50&#41; -&#62; Twister Slash <BR> <BR><B>Notes:</B> <BR> <BR><B>a</B> - Basic starting move <BR><B>b</B> - Requires a POW of 450 or higher <BR><B>c<SUB>1</SUB></B> - Requires monster to be at nature &#39;good&#39; or higher <BR><B>c<SUB>2</SUB></B> - Requires monster to be at a high sub-level of &#39;good&#39; near to &#39;best&#39; <BR><B>d</B> - Requires monster to be at a low sub-level of &#39;bad&#39; near to &#39;worst&#39; <BR><B>e</B> - Requires an INT of 350 or higher <BR><B>f</B> - Requires an INT of 450 or higher <BR><B>g</B> - May only be learned by sub-type Draco Doll &#40;Wracky/Dragon&#41; <BR> <BR>And if I may show off, presenting Shakespeare: <BR> <BR>Age: 9yr. 3mo.

 Generation depends on how strictly you look at it, in terms of monsters which  <BR>were raised beyond ~6 months it&#39;s 3rd, but that was mostly to unlock  <BR>techniques, it started with good int/spd &#40;Bear in mind the speed was reduced to  <BR>~40 by paradoxine&#41; but not much else and only 8 techniques including the 2  <BR>starting basics: <BR> <BR>Lif: 44 Pow: 10 Int: 387 Ski: 93 Spd: 379 Def: 58 <BR> <BR>Short: Weapon, Kick, Spin Kick, Punch <BR>Mid: Necromancy, Sneak Attack <BR>Long: Weapon Throw, Trick <BR>Far: None <BR> <BR>I paradoxined 6 times, beat the D and B at 8/11 months old and spent the rest  <BR>of time until mid stage 4 on errantries once per 3 months to acquire every unlocked  <BR>technique . It spent just under 2 years of prime under magic bananas, was fed both peaches  <BR>and then once it hit stage 7 was battled to unlock the rest of the chains it had left  <BR>&#40;Still over 200 moves worth seeing as none of the previous ones could learn spin slash and  <BR>I didn&#39;t know Wracky combo was chained&#41; and to get the stats up. At around 8 years I froze  <BR>it so it would only come out to battle and that&#39;s where it is now, it may just have  <BR>enough life left in it to max if I&#39;m lucky.

 Oh so you did a bit of Split Infinities method  <BR>during it&#39;s prime. It&#39;s quite a time consuming  <BR>method. <BR> <BR>Hopefully it has enough life left for you to max it  <BR>:D

 Yeah, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d usually have the motivation  <BR>to do this stuff but Shakespeare was more just an  <BR>experiment to see how much I could get out of a  <BR>monster instead of making something useful, unless  <BR>anger  <BR>activates the amount of high guts cost techniques he  <BR>has makes him not exactly practical. Without the  <BR>random  <BR>blast shot lock I managed to &#39;perfect&#39; him though so  <BR>I was happy with the result.
