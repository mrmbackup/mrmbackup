I just ran a series of experiments on the availability of Gold Peaches. Here are the results: <BR> <BR>I took a monster that I had used as a &#34;dummy monster&#34; in DP&#39;s method, which had high stats, but had never gone to an official battle as my test subject. &#40;Durahan/Joker, in case that is of interest.&#41; When I started the experiment, he was 4y 5mo, and had all stats at 999 since he was a leftover from an old gameshark experiment. There was no gameshark use during the experiment at all.  <BR> <BR>First series of experiments were run by saving my game in week 3 of September, then battling the D level tourney to get to C rank and going on the expedition. I only checked the tusk tower, and went home each time. At C rank, I always found 2 disc chips, and either 2 bags of soil, or a bag of soil and a half-eaten. I did this 7 times. <BR> <BR>Then, I waited til the next year, keeping the monster in the freezer, at C rank while I raised another monster. <BR> <BR>The next series of experiments was interesting. Once again, I saved in week 3 of September. Two times I rested in week4 and sent him off at C rank. Same result: 2 disc chips, plus 2 bags of soil found on both trips.  <BR> <BR>Then I re-set and sent him into the B-level official tourney, raising him to A rank, and went on the expedition. I did this five times. Each time he returned with one gold peach and 5 disc chips. &#40;Remember, in this last series, he has the same age each time and the exact same stats.&#41; <BR> <BR>Conclusions: <BR> <BR>These experiments may have been too few in number to have proven anything, but further tests by others are welcomed. <BR> <BR>It appears that rank is a factor in finding peaches. I found peaches 100% of the time with an A rank monster. &#40;Did not test B rank at all.&#41; <BR> <BR>There may be other factors, like stat levels, which have not been fully tested, affecting the outcome.  <BR> <BR>There is still a great deal of randomness associated with the placement of peaches, too. So, be patient! <BR> <BR>Some genral Peach tips: <BR> <BR>The gold peach sets the monster&#39;s internal clock back 50 weeks, silver 25 weeks. You won&#39;t see any indication of this in the game.  <BR> <BR>You can only feed one gold and one silver peach per monster. But, unlike MR1, you can send a monster to find as many peaches as you like. <BR> <BR>Use your peach at about 1 year after the start of &#34;prime&#34;. If you can&#39;t figure out when that is, look in the FAQ section for a thread called &#34;Life Stages the Real Scoop&#34;. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t give a peach after you have gotten the old age warning, it will not add a year once that milestone has been reached.

 Yes, I also have found this to be true. But I still cannot find it 100% of the time at S or A.

 My previous gold peach getter was only B-class. I can&#39;t say he brought one back everytime, but most times, yes. So far, the success ratio is pretty much the same as my current peach getter who is S-class.
