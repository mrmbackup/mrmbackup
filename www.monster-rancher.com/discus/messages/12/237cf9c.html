<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
<CENTER><B>This post is an archived thread from our other location.  <BR>Much of the info in it is out of date.  <BR>We retain it in honor of The HTML Man who did some of the very first research into the game&#39;s inner workings, and assembled teams of researchers.  <BR>This method was written before anyone had hacked into the inner workings of the game, so exact values were not known at the time.</B></CENTER> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Why post this method? <BR>First off this method is just another method. I have experimented with methods, but not too many. I&#39;m posting this because the hacker deleted my other method. Like all methods there are just some things I can&#39;t cover in this method. Sometimes people must improvise with monsters. Stuff can happen and the method won&#39;t work perfectly. I don&#39;t know if anybody will use this method, but it is made to help people to get those high stats and gain some helpful tips about how to raise monsters.  <BR> <BR>For you if:  <BR> <BR>If you want high stats and have a lot of many to spend. If you want to get to beat those hard monsters that everyone talks about beating. If you want to raise some monsters that can compete with the best of the monsters.  <BR> <BR>Not for you if:  <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t like to follow methods. If you don&#39;t like taking other people&#39;s advise. If you do not have a lot of money or patience.  <BR> <BR>Works best with:  <BR> <BR>This method works best with well rounded monsters. Mocchis, Durahans, Beaclons, Pixies, and any monster that gets good stat gains in at least four stats.  <BR> <BR>What you need:  <BR> <BR>2 gemini pots, 2 dino tails, 1 fire stone, at least $175,000, a monster that likes Tablets, and PATIENCE.  <BR> <BR>Abbreviations: NO=Nuts Oil <BR>ML=Mint Leaf <BR>.../...=It means you have a choice. It pretty much means &#34;or&#34;. <BR>LD=Light Drill <BR>HD=Hard Drill <BR> <BR>When to use the peaches:  <BR> <BR>Use the Gold peach about a year into your monster&#39;s prime. Use the Silver peach at the decline of your monster&#39;s prime. <BR> <BR>Why do I throw in all those candies?  <BR> <BR>The candies are thrown in each month to keep your monster&#39;s form at normal. There is no particular reason for keeping your monster&#39;s form normal except people say it is better for your monsters. There is no direct evidence to prove what it does. If your monster starts getting fat, stop feeding it candies.  <BR> <BR>When to use the &#34;drugs&#34;:  <BR> <BR>Use the drugs after your monster is over 5 months old. This way you can optimize the amount of stats gained from the Light Drills. <BR> <BR>The early life of a monster: <BR> <BR> <BR>When you get a monster bring it out on the 4th week of any month. Rest it. Then feed it milk. Now, for the first 5 months of your monster&#39;s life feed it milk and rest it at the end of each month. The schedule for the months are. <BR> <BR>Month 1: &#40;LD,LD,LD,rest&#41;&#40;candy,ML,NO,ML&#41; <BR>Month 2: &#40;LD,LD,LD,rest&#41;&#40;candy,ML,NO,ML&#41; <BR> <BR>During these first 5 months of your monster&#39;s life try not to be too hard on your monster. Train your monster in skill during these months. If your monster isn&#39;t good at skill, try to train another stat. You will need skill though so hopefully you get a monster that is good at skill.  <BR> <BR>Later in Stage 1: <BR> <BR> <BR>Now that your monster is over 5 months old start feeding it Tablets. This is the part where you can start introducing drugs to your monster. Either Paradoxine or Troron will work here. The monthly schedule now changes to:  <BR> <BR>Month 1: &#40;LD,LD,LD,LD&#41;&#40;candy,ML,NO,ML&#41; <BR>Month 2: &#40;LD,LD,LD,LD&#41;&#40;NO,ML,NO,candy&#41; <BR>Month 3: &#40;LD,LD,LD,LD&#41;&#40;NO,ML,NO,ML&#41; <BR>Just repeat months 2 and 3 after you get done with month 1. Month 1 is the first month of your new monthly schedule.  <BR> <BR>During these months try to keep your monster at continous work. There is no need to rest it. Just follow the schedule and don&#39;t send you monster into battle or on errantries. Try to raise your monsters best stats evenly here. Keep its stats going up, but even.  <BR> <BR>Stage 2: <BR> <BR> <BR>Now you encounter two options for your monster. Use which ever you prefer. <BR>Option 1: Start your monster on hard drills even though it might only be gaining like 10 points on its best light drill. This is where you start to raise your monster&#39;s best stats. If you want to send your monster on errantries, now is the time. Make sure that you save befor you send your monster on an errantry. If your monster does not pass or get the technique you wanted, RESET and try again. The monthly schedule is now: <BR> <BR>Month 1: &#40;HD,HD,HD,HD&#41;&#40;candy,ML,NO,ML&#41; <BR>Month 2: &#40;HD,HD,HD,rest&#41;&#40;NO,candy,NO,ML&#41; <BR>Month 3: &#40;HD,HD,HD,HD&#41;&#40;candy,ML,NO,ML&#41; <BR>Month 4: &#40;HD,HD,HD,rest&#41;&#40;NO,candy,NO,candy&#41; <BR>Months 3 and 4 are options. You could just repeat months 1 and 2 over and over. Some monsters are able to handle months 3 and 4 though. Not all monsters can though. So you will probably use months 1 and 2 only.  <BR> <BR>Option 2:  <BR> <BR>You could wait to start Stage 2. If you wait, wait till your monster is gaining like 12&#43; points per best Light Drill. This is the second option. Conditions are the same as Option 1 except you would want to try and send your monster on errantries before you start this stage. You would keep the &#34;Later Stage 1&#34; monthly schedule going, until it gains 12&#43; points on its best Light Drills. After your monster starts gaining 12&#43; points you could start the Hard Drills. The schedule is the same as Option 1. <BR> <BR>In either option though this is your oportunity to enter any tournaments if you want. If you enter a tournament you must do it in place of the Mint Leaf. If it is where you would normally rest, skip the tournament. If you look ahead while you are playing you should be able to plan your tournaments out. Do not fight in a lot of tournaments now though, because you will be fighting in many later on. Also, in both options, only Hard Drill in the stats that your monster excels in.  <BR> <BR>Stage 3: <BR> <BR> <BR>This is your monsters prime. This is when your monster is gaining 15 points per light drill. Now is the time to raise your monsters stats really high. For the first part of your monsters prime you should train it in the stats that it is best at. Only do this for like 3 or 4 months. After that raise all the stats that your monster is weak in. This is the best time to raise those stats up. Using the Hard Drills you will lose some stats in some areas. When you lose it, do a Hard Drill to get that stat back up, then go back to raising the other stat again. For example: On the Meditate Hard Drill you lose defense. So do the Meditate Hard Drill like maybe 3 months then go do the Swimming Hard Drill for like a month to raise up the Defense you lost. Anyway the new monthly schedule is: <BR> <BR>Month 1: &#40;HD,HD,HD,HD&#41;&#40;candy,ML,NO,ML&#41; <BR>Month 2: &#40;HD,HD,HD,rest&#41;&#40;NO,candy,NO,ML&#41; <BR>Month 3: &#40;HD,HD,HD,HD&#41;&#40;candy,ML,NO,ML&#41; <BR>Month 4: &#40;HD,HD,HD,rest&#41;&#40;NO,candy,NO,candy&#41; <BR>Thats right, just keep it the same as it was. Be sure not to max out any stats during this time.  <BR> <BR>Stage 4: <BR> <BR> <BR>This is your monster&#39;s declining stage. For the first couple months of this, when your monster is still gaining 14&#43; points on its best Hard Drill, you can try and raise some of your monsters best stats again. After a few months in the declining stage it will be ready to enter the freezing process. This is where you will really need some patience.  <BR> <BR>The Freezing Process:  <BR> <BR>The freezing process is where you take your monster and throw it in the freezer. You only bring it out to fight in tournaments. You always save before you enter a tournament. Beat the tournament and see if the stats that your monster needs goes up or the stats that you especially want to go up. If all the stats that you wanted to go up, didn&#39;t, RESET and try again. If the stats don&#39;t go up by enough, RESET and try again. After the tournament give your monster a Nuts Oil and freeze it. For the months inbetween just raise any monster to kill.  <BR> <BR>So after your monster becomes to old. Freeze it and save it for combining later. The freezing process will easily get you a huge boost in stats if you have the patience.
