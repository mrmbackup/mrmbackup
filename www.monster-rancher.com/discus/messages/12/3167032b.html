 Hello, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m playing MR2 after a long hiatus and am currently running Lazarus &#40;Lorica:  Durahan/Arrowhead&#41;.  Lazarus stems from good stock, a second generation S-Class Renocraft &#40;Arrowhead/Henger&#41; and a first generation, Hall of Fame pure Durahan.  A crab claw was thrown in for good measure during the combining process.  The resulting monster had over 1300 points in total stats &#40;400&#43; Power and Defense, 200&#43; Skill, 60&#43; speed, yuk&#41;.  He has about 8 techs. <BR> <BR>I am happy with the result.  Question is, where do you think I should go with this?  What is your opinion?  Should I go for massive power first or defense?  Maybe, build Skill way up and move from there?  Or, should I go off on a tangent? <BR> <BR>I know what I would do, but I like to get another <BR>perspective. <BR> <BR>Varthlokkur

 Personally, I would go with Skill first, then in prime heavy Power drill, then Defense. The heavy Power/Defense drills will of course build his Life way up, and then you should probably go with Intelligence so he&#39;s not as weak against those manuevers. Speed with this breed, as with most, if not all Durahan breeds, is pretty much a waste.

 I have to agree on the speed portion.  Though, I am a speed freak.  I&#39;d rather avoid the hit than stand there and take it.  But, with the Lorica, that ain&#39;t gonna happen.

 You&#39;ve got a similar breakdown I had with my  <BR>recent Durahan, Varth.  Your POW and DEF  <BR>are on the same level, and 200&#43; skill is good,  <BR>but I agree with Mordred here.  SKI &#40;also LIF&#41;  <BR>needs to be an early priority.  Also, at that high  <BR>level, your Lorica will probably fail a lot of early  <BR>drills if you train POW or DEF alot &#40;babies tend  <BR>to have trouble with Lv. 2 drills from my  <BR>experience&#41;.  Once he grows up, work the  <BR>heavy drills and SKI alot... then the usual  <BR>Durahan stuff... hitting INT when the other 4  <BR>stats get high... and forgetting SPD is a good  <BR>idea... <BR> <BR>I think the only thing the Lorica really loses  <BR>much in from thepure  Durahan is SKI... In  <BR>retrospect, Henger chips could&#39;ve countered  <BR>that one... or still can if you have a save from  <BR>before the combining. <BR> <BR>PezCat

 Well, I had already thought I would spend the first year raising Skill.  I am a big fan of Skill and try to keep it high.  Let me outline where Lazarus is now. <BR> <BR>Lazarus   Age:  3y 8m <BR>Class B   Lorica &#40;Durhan/Arrowhead&#41; <BR>Initial Stat Total: 1390 <BR>Lif: 285  Pow: 683 <BR>Int: 223  Ski: 522 <BR>Spd: 136  Def: 520 <BR> <BR>Record: 27W 0L 23KO  Fame: 100 &#40;what else?&#41; <BR> <BR>Never hurt, sick, runaway or resist.  Style: Even / Form: Slim / Nature: Best <BR> <BR>Been on 2 Errantries, Speed and Skill.  Has 8 techniques. <BR> <BR>Overall, I am very happy with his results so far.  It took him approxiamately 2 years to get to full-size.  I would like more speed out of him, but, know that is not a reality.  Probably, I will do all the Speed Errantries to raise his speed as much as possible until I cannot get anymore Sharp techs. <BR> <BR>PezCat, as for the item during combining,  <BR>I feel that the Crab&#39;s Claw was best in this case for the added defense and skill. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the input, <BR> <BR>Varthlokkur

 Looks to me like you&#39;re doing well.  A big advantage of the Lorica type is that both the main and sub-breeds have a long lifespan.  This can be used &#40;in conjunction with peaches, natch!&#41; to raise even that pesky Speed stat to a respectable level, especially if you use the Freeze &amp; Fight method after your monster&#39;s prime. <BR> <BR>My own Lorica, Scorpius, is living proof: <BR> <BR>Scorpius <BR>Durahan/Arrowhead <BR> <BR>LIF: 926 <BR>POW: 999 <BR>INT: 505 <BR>SKI: 876 <BR>SPD: 455 <BR>DEF: 999 <BR> <BR>Major 4 Winner, beat Poritoka in Legends Cup <BR>Techniques: 14 &#40;including my fave, Millionstabs&#41; <BR>Age: 7 years, 9 months, and still goin&#39; strong! <BR> <BR>Ol&#39; Scorpy is my first Hall Of Famer.  Note that I never once trained him in LIF; it&#39;s all byproduct of POW &amp; DEF heavy drills, and errantries.  I intend to battle him to the brink of death &#40;and although he&#39;s had his Gold Peach, he has yet to taste Silver, so there are battles ahead for sure!&#41;, then combine him with my Phoenix, Shimmerwing &#40;who&#39;s coming along quite nicely itself...&#41;. With either a Crab Claw for an initial boost or a Mock disk for increased lifespan during the combining process, I hope to get a very strong Garuda right out of the gate.  My goal is to be powerful enough by the age of 6-and-a-half or so to be able to stomp Most like a cockroach...

 Well, Lorica is doing well.  He is 7y&#43; and has beaten the M-4. Game is saved on the week of the Legends Cup.  I am hoping to fight the White Mocchi and crush his little skull.  So, I will do that tonight.  This monster has the highest combined stats of any I&#39;ve had yet.  His one big weakness is Speed.  Just over 200.  I should have all the data by tomorrow. <BR> <BR>But, the true glory is that I sent him on the Kawrea Expedition for laughs and he got me the Joker Mask.  Finally!  I am very happy about that. Now to get the Zilla Beard... <BR> <BR>Varthlokkur

 Hee, hee!  Thanks, Torey! <BR> <BR>Oh, BTW, after my first monster or two croaked far too early due to some bad habits I developed in &#40;the far more forgiving!&#41; MR1, I started using RNA&#39;s raising method.  With a few minor variations - for example, I&#39;m a Technique Hound, so I give errantries a little more attention at certain stages - I&#39;ve gotten it to work very well.  Tip o&#39; the cap to RNA! <BR> <BR>Just wanted to share that, in case anyone else would like a Lorica like mine...  ;^&#41;

 Well, got good news and real bad news. <BR> <BR>Good News <BR>Lazarus made it into the hall of fame, got me the Joker Mask and Zilla Beard. <BR> <BR>Bad News <BR>I was helping my daughter with her MR2 game and saved it over mine.

 A whole thread eh.  Well, I lost the whole thing once.  No back-up.  Back in the early days when MR2 first came out.  Had 100&#43; years.   Gone!  Poof! <BR> <BR>However, it did help prove some raising/training theories. <BR> <BR>Varthlokkur

 Oh Varth, man, what a bummer!  I once lost almost ten years to similar error; now I back up to a seperate mem card every three or four years with truly paranoid devotion.  My condolences on your snafu.  But fear not!  Lazarus WILL rise again!

<B>Lazarus has risen again!</B>  <BR> <BR>See the first message in the tread for most of the info.  The only difference is that his initial stats combined was over 1400.  It will be interesting if he will surpass his former life. <BR> <BR>Varthlokkur

 Well, he beat Most by outlasting it.  I got real lucky.  A couple of Most&#39;s attacks missed and Lazarus II got in a couple of minor hits &#40;ex. Charge&#41;.  Again, it wasn&#39;t a knock out, it was a toe to toe fight. <BR> <BR>Rob, Lazarus will be combined eventually, probably to make another Durahan sub-type.  But, since it is fairly easy to get Durahans &#40;now!&#41;, I may let it become a sub-type instead.  I&#39;ll have to look at the monster lists first. <BR> <BR>Thanks Everyone.
