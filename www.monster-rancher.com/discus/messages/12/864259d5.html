 In order to get Mock, Ghost, and Wracky, do I need to let 3 monsters die?  Or just two?

 two. one for the mock and one for the wracky.  You will get the stick for the ghost from the same death that gets you the mock, you just have to wait for master Pabs to visit a few times and upgrade the alter from the death that created the mock.

 well its all on how you look at it. <BR>A simple mistake isn&#39;t always a mistake to the trainer. &#42; tho I prefer the term &#34;Rancher&#34;&#42;

 I got the Wracky Doll and the seed around year 7 into the game.  About 12 years later the tree withered and Colt asked me to water it.  After that I let a monster die to see which monster i will get between Wracky and Mock, and of course I got Mock. <BR> <BR>I also let a monster die just before that to see Wracky&#39;s stat.  Here is something I want to ask.  How come Colt get to name Wracky and Mock?  If she can&#39;t give them good names then she shouldn&#39;t.  Don&#39;t know if Colt gives all Mock the same name but mine is Gonzales.

 I don&#39;t see where anybody used the term trainer or mistake before you Rovest.  Therefore you stand accused of attempting to hijack the thread.  :P  In answer to your question, all of them.  Ok theoretically 10 tournies and 52 fights, but the reality is different.  Unless you are using a gameshark to generate gold, you will end up fighting much more than that.

 Yep, they&#39;re all named Gonzalez Kimochi, and then she goes and names the wracky Charles, CHARLES!! I mean C&#39;MON! I&#39;m happy those are the only monsters that Colt ever gets to name, if she got a say in some others they might have names like Percy or Frederika.

 I used the term Trainer. Like the game uses in the MR1 manual we are deemed &#34;Master Breeder&#34; when we reach the highest rank. In MR2 it states in page 18 &#34;The Master Trainer&#34; when obtaining the highest rank. I no longer have my MR3 manual &#42;the house cat coughed up aslimy hairball on it&#42;. But I prefer the term Rancher because in MR3 you Really are a Rancher since you use 5 differnt ranches. <BR> <BR>As so this topic doesn&#39;t go to far off. <BR>I had used 6 deaths to get the Mock. for some reason It wouldn&#39;t die so I couldn&#39;t get the mock.

 Wow, 6 deaths to get Mock? <BR>Hehe...how is that possible? <BR>Don&#39;t you supposed to get Mock after you returned from the ceremony of your dead monster?  Of course the tree you planted need to wither and die first.

 you have to start going to the item shop fairly early on in your game. If you wait too long for your first visit, you can actually wind up never getting the seeds at all.

 Isn&#39;t it like, every 140 weeks you get a new item, and if you got manseitan before the seeds, you can&#39;t get the seeds?

 How did it die twice? Wondering here... <BR> <BR>MJ, I&#39;ll have to learn some of your methods. I&#39;m working on a way to kill monsters in the quickest way possible, while gaining some $$$ from them in the bargain. The Dead Naga Project.  <BR> <BR>So, I guess the question is: What is the shortest lifespan of any of your monsters, and how did it happen? Hopefully stuff like this will help my project...

 Well it died when it was thought to be just a tree then died as in bye bye poor Mocky bye bye my dear you know as in poof.  And Ghosts have very short life spans.  Hares are fun to kill they start with crappy stats especially life a defense so they die easily &#40;go against whats his face in E that yellow dude lol&#41;.

 It died while still a tree? What, it never became an actual monster? I&#39;m really curious... <BR> <BR>As for the Hare killing, You seem to be onto something. My first Zumm, back when I just began MR2, died in 7 months. I battled him a bunch, and Oakleyman killed him with that straight of his. I think that doing battle against very tough opponents is the best way to kill a monster. We&#39;ll see. I&#39;m going to try Naga, and maybe the zuum.

 well this is how it works <BR>Easiest to kill monsters are Hare and pixies for the most part <BR>Hardest to kill Golems and Sometimes Pixies with annoyingly high speed.

 Yeah, that makes sense. The idea of the project is to help people trying to unlock Ghost, Mock and Wracky by showing them the quickest and easiest way to kill a monster. Hare may be the best bet, but it&#39;s not available all the time. That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to try Mocchi or Zuum. Besides, I don&#39;t have the heart to kill bunnies. My pure hare is one of the best monsters I&#39;ve raised.  <BR>Also, the Dead Naga project is an idea for a trainer who needs both a dead monster &amp; cash. Essentially, it&#39;ll be a naga that fights all the time.  <BR> <BR>Hardest to kill? I&#39;d add Arrowheads and Gaboos.

 Sueki Suezo is the easiest solution. You can use the info in the Lab to burn a CD that makes one.
