<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>Dark Phoenix</B> on <B>Thursday, June 22, 2000 - 09:35 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 Most of use have wondered for a very long time about the exact effects of items that just sit in your inventory. So far, I have only figured out the effects of the Sculpture &#40;aka. Artemis Statue&#41; and the Gemini&#39;s Pot, but I plan to post more in the near future. <BR> <BR>Although it is not completely necessary that you do this, I STRONGLY suggest that you are familiar with the system for Lifespan loss &#40;read the &#34;Lifespan Hits&#34; thread, first post&#41;. <BR> <BR> <BR>SCULPTURE: <BR> <BR>The Sculpture reduces Fatigue in your monster at the very beginning of each month. The amount of Fatigue reduced by the Sculpture varies as follows: <BR> <BR>Current Fatigue --- Amount Reduced <BR>- 0 to 33 Fatigue: Sculpture has no effect <BR>- 34 to 66 Fatigue: -1 Fatigue <BR>- 67 to 99 Fatigue: -2 Fatigue <BR>- 100 Fatigue: -3 Fatigue <BR> <BR> <BR>The effects of multiple Sculptures ARE cumulative. So, if your monster has 80 Fatigue at the beginning of the month, having 2 Sculptures would reduce that to 76 Fatigue. However, this is where the problems begin...... <BR> <BR> <BR>When you have multiple Sculptures, the effects of each on are evaluated 1 at a time. Let&#39;s say that your monster has 70 Fatigue at the beginning of the month and you have 3 Sculptures in your inventory. This is what happens: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Your monster has 70 Fatigue. The effects of the first Sculpture are evaluated &#40;refer to the above chart&#41;. Your monster&#39;s Fatigue is reduced by 2 points, bringing it to a total of 68 Fatigue. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Your monster now has 68 Fatigue. The effects of the second Sculpture are evaluated. Your monster&#39;s Fatigue is reduced by 2 more points, bringing it to a total of 66 Fatigue. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Your monster now has 66 Fatigue. The effects of the third Sculpture are evaluated. Now, since your monster has only 66 Fatigue, the last Sculpture will reduce your monster&#39;s Fatigue by only 1 point &#40;refer to the above chart if necessary&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, -5 Fatigue for 3 Sculptures. That&#39;s not terrible, but let&#39;s take a case that&#39;s a bit more extreme. <BR> <BR>You hear that Sculptures reduce Fatigue and that the multiple Sculptures have a cumulative effect. So, you go ahead and fill all 20 spaces of your inventory with Sculptures &#40;yes, I ACTUALLY tried this&#41;. At the beginning of the month, your monster has 34 Fatigue. This is what happens: <BR> <BR>1&#41; The first Sculpture takes effect. Your monster&#39;s Fatigue is reduced to 33 points. <BR>2&#41; Now, since your monster only has 33 points of Fatigue, the other 19 Sculptures have absolutely no effect, other than taking up inventory space. <BR> <BR> <BR>Guess what, it gets worse...... <BR> <BR>While the Sculpture takes effect at the beginning of the month before feeding, it doesn&#39;t occur until AFTER the lifespan hit process takes place. So, if your monster has 70 Fatigue and 0 Stress, and one Sculpture reduces this to 68 Fatigue, you STILL TAKE THE LIFESPAN HIT, even though you are now in the safe zone. <BR> <BR> <BR>GEMINI&#39;S POT: <BR> <BR>The Gemini&#39;s Pot works EXACTLY like the Sculpture, but for Stress instead of Fatigue. If you&#39;ve read the &#34;Lifespan Hits&#34; thread, then you should know that Stress reduction is twice as important as Fatigue reduction, so the Gemini&#39;s Pot is better, right??? Consider the following: the Gemini&#39;s Pot does not even begin to work until your monster has 34 points of Stress. If you have a mere 2 points of Fatigue, then you will already be taking a lifespan hit. I do my best to keep my monster&#39;s Stress under 20 points at all times, so if you ask me, I think that the Gemini&#39;s Pot is even more useless than the Sculpture &#40;but that&#39;s just my opinion. You&#39;ve been given the data, so form your own....&#41; <BR> <BR>-Nevistar   <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;NOTE&#42;&#42;  This is NOT done by me.  This was done by Nevistar.
