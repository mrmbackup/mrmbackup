 This is long, as it includes structure as well as narrative.  Look for lines of asterisks as dividers. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>So, I have noticed that pretty much all of the good training methods around here, even a lot of the first-timer methods, require you to be feeding your monster Tablets, or at least Meat.  This is a bit of a problem if you are raising a monster to eat Cup Jellies because you are trying to get a Ducken or Beaclon.  So, I made a method specifically for Cup Jelly raising.  I hope it&#39;s useful to someone else; it took me a while to maximize work without going into the Lifespan loss zone. <BR> <BR>I know not everyone does, but if you have Excel or OpenOffice or any of most spreadsheet programs, I have made a &#34;Raising Methods&#34; sheet that will do the math for you when you are developing a raising style, and that lays these out in a much more readable fashion.  At the moment, the only items the calculator can recognize are Nuts Oils, and Mint Leaves, but if people are inclined to try or use it, I can add the other ones in. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Also, is HTML turned off on these forums?  I originally tried to put these into a table, and it didn&#39;t go through. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>This strips off Form like nobody&#39;s business, so I recommend using it on a monster you want to be Skinny so you don&#39;t have to fight it. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>The rules for this one are: <BR> <BR>1. Lifespan hits are to be avoided. &#40;Errantry Lifespan hits excepted, as they are uncontrollable.&#41; <BR>2. Stats are to be maximized. <BR>4. Work loss due to recovery from Errantries and Expeditions is to be minimized. <BR> <BR>Underlying Assumptions, assuming maximum detriments and minimum benefits: <BR> <BR>1: Rest with no items recovers 5 Stress and 33 Fatigue. <BR>2. Rest with a Lump of Ice or Fire Stone recovers 9 Stress and 43 Fatigue. <BR>3. Nuts Oils Restore 28 Fatigue. <BR>4. Mint Leaves Restore half of current stress, normal rounding. <BR>5. Lifespan Index is calculated at the beginning of each week. <BR>6. Hard Drills add 12 Stress and 15 Fatigue. <BR>7. Light Drills add 5 Stress and 10 Fatigue. <BR> <BR>And the one that will require adjustment if I&#39;m wrong: <BR> <BR>6. Lifespan Index is NOT calculated at Feeding Time. I.E., the LI at the end of Week 4 can be over 69 as long as the food brings it into the safe zone. <BR> <BR>If the last one is wrong, it still only gets to exactly 70 if you make absolutely the worst rolls for both Stress and Fatigue, which is a 1 in 75 chance.  You pays your money and you makes your bet.  If someone can confirm that I am wrong on this one, I will post an adjusted version. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Abbreviations used throughout this document: <BR> <BR> <BR>HD= Hard Drill <BR>LD= Light Drill <BR>RT= Rest <BR>FD= Food <BR> <BR>JE= Cup Jelly <BR>NO= Nuts Oil <BR>ML= Mint Leaf <BR>??= Any Item <BR> <BR>LI= Lifespan Index; Fatigue&#43;&#40;Stress&#42;2&#41;.  Must never be at 70 at the beginning of a week. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Please note that the Lifespan Indexes listed are the ones left at the END of that week.  The math was less confusing that way.  Thus, this is the number that carries over to the next day.  If I am understanding correctly,  Lifespan index is only checked at the beginning of calendar weeks, and not at feeding time.  The corollary being that the LI at the end of Week 4 can be 70&#43; as long as the FD brings it out of the danger zone. <BR> <BR>The numbers I list for Lifespan index are the numbers you get after the pattern reaches stasis, when the numbers on a given week never change.  It doesn&#39;t reach stasis until part way through the second month.  The numbers before that are a touch lower than this on the first run-through, assuming you start with 0,0.  Do not start with higher numbers than are listed at that point in the pattern, or many bad things will happen.  This is fairly touchy and will ratchet upward quickly if given the fuel. <BR> <BR>I list it so that it starts with the lowest point in the LI pattern, which I assume is what people mean by when a pattern &#34;starts&#34;  I&#39;m not sure, though, so rotate to taste.  Predictably, the two low points are right after the Rests. <BR> <BR>&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43; <BR> <BR>Eat Those Jellies, Baby! &#40;Pre-Hard Drill Training&#41; <BR> <BR>Job:	FD,	LD,	LD,	LD,	LD <BR>Itm:	JE,	ML,	NO,	ML,	NO <BR>Str:	11,	11,	16,	13,	18 <BR>Ftg:	10,	20,	10,	20,	10 <BR>LI :	32,	42,	42,	46,	46 <BR> <BR> <BR>Eat Those Jellies! <BR> <BR>Job:	HD,	HD,	FD,	LD,	HD,	RT,	HD,	FD,	HD,	RT <BR>Itm:	??,	ML,	JE,	NO,	ML,	ML,	??,	JE,	ML,	ML <BR>Str:	16,	20,	13,	18,	21,	06,	18,	11,	18,	04 <BR>Ftg:	15,	30,	30,	12,	27,	00,	15,	15,	30,	00 <BR>LI :	47,	70,	56,	12,	69,	12,	51,	37,	66,	08 <BR> <BR>If I am wrong about not calculating LI before feeding, insert a Mint Leaf into the first empty item slot, and the 70 drops to 68.  Nothing much else changes. <BR> <BR>So, that&#39;s the main pattern, satisfying Rules 1 and 2. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>To satisfy Rule 3, I needed to figure out the fastest and most efficient way to clear down to 0,0 at the beginning of a month, and then to clear out the Stress and Fatigue after Errantries and Expeditions. <BR> <BR>So, I made a pattern that takes exactly 4 weeks to pick up the totals in the first week of a month from the main pattern, and work them down to 0,0 for the beginning of the next month.  As the starting totals are different depending on where you interrupt the main pattern, I am listing both sets of numbers.  Set 1 is if this pattern is following the month with the second-week RT, 2  is following third-week RT.  I hope that makes sense.  It does to me, but I&#39;ve been screwing with this for days. <BR> <BR> <BR>Eat Those Jellies!  <BR>Zeroing Variant &#40;I can&#39;t think of a cool name&#41; <BR> <BR>		Before <BR>Job:	FD,	Heavy,	LD,	LD,	RT,	FD <BR>Itm:	JE,	NO,	ML,	NO,	ML,	JE <BR>St1:	12,	24,	17,	22,	06,	0 <BR>Ft1:	30,	17,	27,	10,	00,	0 <BR>LI1:	54,	65,	61,	54,	12,	0 <BR>St2:	08,	20,	15,	20,	05,	0 <BR>Ft2:	15,	15,	25,	10,	00,	0 <BR>LI2:	31,	55,	55,	50,	10,	0 <BR> <BR>And then to recover from Errantry or Expedition effects with minimal loss of training time.  At the beginning of the next month, you can start the zeroing pattern if you are going HD and fast, or pick up at either month of the main pattern, without fear of Lifespan loss. <BR> <BR> <BR>Eat Those Retro Jellies!  <BR>Returning Variant <BR> <BR>		Before <BR>Job:	`ET,	`FD,	RT,	HD,	RT,	HD <BR>Itm:,	`XX,	`JE,	ML,	NO,	ML,	Any <BR>Str:	028,	021,	06,	18,	04,	16 <BR>Ftg:	072,	072,	39,	26,	00,	15 <BR>LI :	128,	114,	51,	62,	08,	47 <BR> <BR>So, that&#39;s the basic set, which I recommend using from whenever you want to start Hard Drills until... you get the Fire Stone or Lump of Ice.  See the next division for why changing it is good. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>In order to continue following Rule 2 &#40;maximize stats&#41;, I needed to take advantage of the improved RT.  Once you get more oomph out of your RTing, you can go to a simpler and more rigorous pattern which allows you to get three Hard Drills a month, every month, without killing the thing despite the Jello diet. :-J  It&#39;s also a bit easier to keep track of. <BR> <BR>I know it looks really simple, but with the low-end FD, there is very little leeway for moving things around and still maximizing work.  I tried very HD, but I could not manage a third-week RT version or get another drill, HD or LD, into a two-month pattern.  Once again, I include zeroing and recovery variants.  Obviously, when you get the Lump of Ice or Fire Stone, I recommend using this method.  The other still works, it&#39;s just kind of a waste.   <BR> <BR>Eat Those &#40;Iced&#41; Jellies! <BR> <BR>Job:	FD,	HD,	RT,	HD,	HD,	 <BR>Itm:	JE,	NO,	ML,	??,	ML <BR>Str:	13,	25,	04,	16,	20 <BR>Ftg:	30,	17,	00,	15,	30,	 <BR>LI :	56,	67,	08,	47,	70 <BR> <BR>There are two variants for zeroing, depending on whether you would rather have a Hard Drill and two Light Drills, or two Hard Drills.  The Hard Drill version has the advantage of having two open item slots. <BR> <BR>Light Drill Version: <BR>Job:	FD,	HD,	LD,	LD,	RT <BR>Itm:	JE,	NO,	ML,	ML,	ML <BR>Str:	13,	25,	18,	14,	0 <BR>Ftg:	30,	17,	27,	37,	0 <BR>LI :	56,	67,	63,	65,	0 <BR> <BR>Hard Drill Version: <BR>Job:	FD,	HD,	RT,	HD,	RT <BR>Itm:	JE,	NO,	ML,	??,	Any <BR>Str:	13,	25,	4,	16,	0 <BR>Ftg:	30,	17,	0,	15,	0 <BR>LI :	56,	67,	8,	47,	0 <BR> <BR>And then coming home- with the right item order, you almost don&#39;t miss a beat: <BR> <BR> <BR>Iced Jelly Returns! <BR> <BR>Job:	`EX,	`FD,	RT,	HD,	LD,	HD <BR>Itm:	`XX	`JE,	ML,	NO,	NO,	ML <BR>Str:	`28,	`21,	`2,	14,	19,	22 <BR>Ftg:	`72,	`72,	29,	16,	10,	25 <BR>LI :	128,	114,	33,	44,	48,	69 <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>BUT FF, you ask, how the heck do we know any of this works?  Below is a monster raised in this style, and I think he did pretty darn well.  He is the offspring of a Sueki Suezo and a straight-from-disk Galaxy.  I raised him with a pretty standard LD, LD, LD, RT method until he hit Prime, although I probably screwed up a lot- I was being very distracted.  I don&#39;t _think_ I lost life, but we&#39;ll see.  When he hit Prime, I realized I didn&#39;t have a plan for his Hard Drill training and started on this.  When I got the Lump of Ice, I switched to the Iced Jellies variant. <BR> <BR>He was being bonsai&#39;d a little bit as I am planning to use him for breeding, which brings the stats down a touch because I wasn&#39;t entirely going with his strengths, but it&#39;s not too harsh.  Basically, I spent a lot of time working on his worst stats, which I probably would have done to some extent, anyway.  He went on 6 Errantries, all during his &#34;baby&#34; period, with the associated Lifespan loss.  I never got stress or fatigue warnings from colt- never went past &#34;Seems Well&#34;.  He has eaten nothing but Cup Jellies.  He is at the stage of decline where he is getting 12-15 on his best Hard Drill as of freezing. <BR> <BR>OverEasy- Galaxy &#40;Suezo/Gali&#41; <BR> <BR>Growth pattern of a Galaxy: <BR> <BR>Life-	2 <BR>Power- 	3 <BR>Intel.-	5 <BR>Skill-	4 <BR>Speed-	2 <BR>Defense-2 <BR> <BR>At Start: <BR> <BR>LF:,	108 <BR>Power:	166 <BR>Intel.:	171 <BR>Skill:	156 <BR>Speed:	90 <BR>Defense:218 <BR> <BR>Spit, Tail Assault <BR> <BR>As of Starting Eat Those Jellies! <BR> <BR>1 Year, 1 Month Old <BR>Just entered Prime <BR> <BR>LF:,	189 <BR>Power:	210 <BR>Intel.:	319 <BR>Skill:	219 <BR>Speed:	202 <BR>Defense:257 <BR> <BR>Teleport, Spit, Tail Assault, Telekinesis, Bite, Telepathy, Lick, Kiss <BR> <BR>As of Switching to Iced Jelly Variant: <BR> <BR>3 Years, 10 Months Old <BR>Still High Prime, has been Golden Peached, has done each Expedition once. <BR> <BR>LF:,	328 <BR>Power:	430 <BR>Intel.:	637 <BR>Skill:	326 <BR>Speed:	309 <BR>Defense:270 <BR> <BR>Same Techs: Teleport, Spit, Tail Assault, Telekinesis, Bite, Telepathy, Lick, Kiss <BR> <BR>As of Freezing: <BR> <BR>5 Years, 10 Months Old <BR>Early Decline/Late Prime, has won the Greatest Four. <BR> <BR>LF:,	433 <BR>Power:	474 <BR>Intel.:	955 <BR>Skill:	425 <BR>Speed:	531 <BR>Defense:477 <BR> <BR>Total Stats: 3295 <BR> <BR>I could keep going and finish leveling up more stats, but his job is primarily to transfer Techs, so I froze him as soon as he started heading down.  All in all, I think he makes fine breeding stock, and he did pretty darn well in the arena.  No Bananas were used.  For reference on lifespan, the base lifespan for a Galaxy is 410 weeks, or 8 years, 6 weeks.  According to my math &#40;410-6&#43;50=454&#41;, he still has a long way to go in actual life span, even if I did screw up a few times before I had a real plan.  If anyone is interested, I can keep playing him on an alternate save and see how long he keeps going and where he ends on stats, or raise one entirely with this method, including childhood &#40;I didn&#39;t figure that part out until later&#41;, and see what happens. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>So, I hope this comes in handy for anyone getting frustrated at not being able to really push a monster who&#39;s living on Cup Jellies.  I ended up raising him his entire life on Jellies due to how long it took to get ten diamond marks &#40;5 before the glue, 5 after&#41;, but you could also use this while you&#39;re getting the 30 into a worm while working on a Beaclon. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>FF

 This is a new Raising Style.  I just realized that neither the title nor the first sentence really shows that, so I figured I&#39;d post something to make it a little clearer on the new-post page.  Other than that, this is a completely pointless message, and thank you for not heckling.

I believe, and i&#39;m sure Lisa will correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but lifespan loss is calculated at the begining of the week when the screen goes black. <BR>In week 1 of each month, the screen goes black BEFORE feeding time.  <BR>Therefore, i assume that lifespan loss is calcuated BEFORE feeding time. <BR>I have centered my methods around that fact, and it would make everything easier if the life-hit happended after feeding.  <BR>Please sombody verify me or set me straight. <BR> <BR> <BR><B>Wildly incorrect false information deleted by moderator.</B> <BR> <BR>Finnaly, for me, my monsters went into erranties at 0,0, but because of the stress build up during erranties, if i fed them cup jellies i got the &#34;monster is stressed out&#34; message. <BR>Maybe it&#39;s just me, but i feed my monsters tablets  the first week back from erranties. <BR> <BR> <BR>Good work on this guide! I appreciate that you made so many different variants!  <BR> <BR>Also, sorry if I&#39;m wrong about anything. Nobody&#39;s perfect. Especially me!

 &#60;laugh&#62;  Not requiring anyone to be perfect, I don&#39;t want that standard applied to me. :-J <BR> <BR>From what I saw, no matter what you feed your monster, you end up with roughly the same stress after a Rest and Mint Leaf, because the Mint Leaf picks up the slack. <BR> <BR>I think you might be looking at Rest for the 5 Stress recovery.  I am assuming that the monster likes Jellies for this, so it is 7.  I decided it wasn&#39;t even worth it to figure it for monsters that _don&#39;t_ like Jelly- it&#39;s hard enough as it is! <BR> <BR>Hm... I just ran through the events again, and I think you&#39;re right about it being part of the week rather than between.  Okay, I&#39;ll need to make some adjustments.  It works as being able to give two items in one week, not an item between weeks.  Darn it.   <BR> <BR>Corrections will be up shortly.  The main pattern is easy to fix, you just lose an item slot, but I didn&#39;t try the others. Mrf. <BR> <BR>FF

 Oh, and before I did the new ones, I decided that screwing around with a halfway-functional calculation sheet was probably part of the problem, so my sheet now covers everything but the statue and like items.  I haven&#39;t decided out how to count those in yet. <BR> <BR>FF

 Come on, no one has _anything_ to say?  I&#39;d at least like someone to check my math; this is the first style I&#39;ve made with actual calculations, and I&#39;m not absolutely sure I accounted for everything. <BR> <BR>FF

 i was actually thinking about posting my cup jelly methods but these are far more thorough and better. <BR> <BR>I would check it, but the way you put the numbers that occur at the end of the week confuses me. Also confusing is that you start each pattern with stress and fatigue. I usually plan it with 0,0 then figure out the numbers week by week untill it repeats numbers. It would be better for me to check if you reposted it one of those ways, but thats alot of work. I think i&#39;ll try to proofread it anyway, but again, the way you did it makes it harder for me.

 I can probably move things around to put them in the more standard format of showing the Stress/Fatigue that the day starts with, if it helps. <BR> <BR>I think I did this reversed from the usual idea of how to make a system.  Most people seem to start with 0/0, and work to get back to that within a reasonable time.  I started with the &#34;ideal&#34; pattern, all Hard Drills, and all Mint Leaves, as Stress is more of a problem than Fatigue.  Then I put a Rest at the point the Lifespan Index first went over 70 &#40;third week&#41;, and put a Nuts Oil before it.  That means the fourth week starts with the lowest point other than zeroed &#40;might be zeroed&#41;, and the food is applied to the stress of that Hard Drill and any left over. <BR> <BR>That gives me my new &#34;starting&#34; numbers, so I put those back in at the beginning and see if I have a balanced loop; enough Fatigue and Stress are getting canceled out that it doesn&#39;t rise indefinitely.  If not, I work to balance the extra, and the pattern grows from that.  If I have to give up too much to make it a balanced loop in one month that stays under 69, I spread it to two months to see if I can make it work with only giving up the work every other month.  For this one, the Rests would not move no matter what I did.  One had to be week 2, the other week 3, or I could not get the pattern to work to save my life.   <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t done an adult Tablet pattern yet, because I like the &#40;Nearly&#41; Energizer Bunny variants, and from the numbers, I suspect I would end up with something very close to that using my method.  I probably will at some point just to see, though. <BR> <BR>FF

<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
I am trying to look at the numbers here, but your format is confusing. Why do you have feeding as a separate week? I&#39;m not getting how you are calculating the numbers... <BR> <BR>Most of us write them out horizontally, with the LI formula and each week numbered, so it looks like &#40;ignoring form, spoil, etc. and using neutral #s&#41;: <BR>  <BR>1&#41; LD, ML = 10F &#43; &#40;2 x &#91;5 -50%&#93;&#41;s = 10F &#43;5s = 15LI <BR>2&#41; LD, NO = &#91;10&#43;10&#93;F &#43; &#40;2 x &#91;2.5&#43;5&#93;&#41;s -28F = 0F &#43; 15s = 15LI <BR>3&#41; LD, ML = 10F &#43; &#40;2 x &#91;{15 &#43; 5} - 50%&#93;&#41;s = 10F &#43; 20s = 30LI <BR>4&#41; LD, NO = &#91;10 &#43; 10&#93;F &#43; &#40;2 x &#91;10 &#43; 5&#93;&#41;s -28F = 0F &#43; 30s = 30LI <BR>1&#41; LD, CJ, ML = 10F &#43; &#40;2 x &#91;{30 &#43; 5 -5} - 50%&#93;&#41;s = 10F &#43; 30s = 40LI <BR> <BR>It&#39;s just easier to see the math this way, and catch errors. But amyway, I am confused about what&#39;s happening in week one. <BR> <BR>And, SOS, you are far from qualified for passing judement on methods if you don&#39;t even understand what&#39;s happening. I suggest you limit further posts to asking questions rather than handing out incorrect &#39;information&#39;.

 :-/  I find the horizontal way more confusing, but I think in grids.  I have tons of homework today, but I will reformat into the horizontal form sometime before Wednesday night so it&#39;s easier to get feedback. <BR> <BR>Feeding is in it&#39;s own &#34;week&#34; because that way I only had to have one row for items, and I was sort of thinking/hoping that it was between weeks.  I&#39;ll integrate it when I put things horizontal. <BR> <BR>Is it preferable for each week to be listed with the numbers it starts with, or the numbers it ends with?  I did ends with because that made more sense to me, possibly just due to my format, but I can do it either way when I reformat.

Week one feeding is just adding an extra item per week, the drill is always calculated on top of the carryover, then the item effects are applied.  <BR> <BR><I>&#34;All math for items values, stress, lifespan, etc. must be provided, as well as the weekly lifespan index numbers.&#34;</I> <BR> <BR>The end numbers for each week are fine, but, we require that you show the entirety of the math you are using as well as the numbers, so the work is transparent and anyone checking the math can do it quickly. It also helps us point out where you may have calculated things incorrectly. Since it is traditional for formulas to be written horizontally in western mathematics, that is the standard.

 Makes sense, now that I think of it.  I&#39;m not sure why I thought &#34;show the math&#34; meant to show which formula I was using, not run the numbers out in the open.  I drove my Algebra teacher nuts that way too. :-J

 Yeah, sorry if I came across as kind of harsh about it, but it&#39;s really  <BR>hard to see what you did without showing your work. -Or to know  <BR>if I made a mistake while doing my checking calculations. If you  <BR>type it out, people can follow &#40;or critique&#41; each step far more easily.
