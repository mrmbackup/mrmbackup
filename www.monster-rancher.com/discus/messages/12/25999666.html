 Disclaimer: This document is simply an intellectual excercise on my part, an exploration of possibilities, if you will, and does not provide a single, all-encompassing training method.  That is left as an excercise for the reader. <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>Browsing through the messages on this board, I was intrigued to find a reference to a comment made by RNA.  Paraphrased roughly, it stated that over the course of understanding more of the game mechanics, all training methods would look the same.  Was there some Grand Unifying Method?  There was certainly reason to suspect that many of the raising factors were constant, since Dark Phoenix and others were able to access memory values directly and deduce their meanings.  Taking their findings as the starting point of my exploration, I began with a little math. <BR> <BR>First, what were the desired maximum and minimum values?  For most trainers, I assumed that a maximum of attribute values was desired, and tied closely to that, a minimum value of lifespan wasted.  Depending on the breed and generation of the monster, specific techniques might also be desired, evaluated with a boolean &#40;true/false&#41;. <BR> <BR>In English, this set of assumptions can be summed up in the statement: <BR>A. &#34;I want my monster to reach its greatest ability potential, and have zero or more specific technique&#40;s&#41;.&#34; <BR>The statement also implies: <BR>B. &#34;I want my monster to live at least long enough to achieve statement A.&#34; <BR> <BR>Keep in mind, when devising a method, that there are other values to optimize for &#40;or disregard&#41;, including money &#40;in game&#41;, time &#40;in and out of game&#41;, excessive button pressing, and excessive saving and loading.  All of these will affect your monster&#39;s maximum possible ability potential. <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s look at some numbers.  &#40;The data was credited to Nevistar, I&#39;ve just arranged it in a formula.&#41; <BR>Life lost at the beginning of each week is calculated by: <BR> <BR>F = Total Current Fatigue <BR>S = Total Current Stress <BR>L = Life loss &#40;in weeks&#41; <BR> <BR>I. L&#40;F,S&#41; = &#40;round down &#40;&#40;F &#43; 2S&#41; / 35&#41; - 1 <BR>Treat L values below 0 as 0. <BR> <BR>For example, if a monster has a Fatigue of 30 and a stress of 19 at the end of a given week, then <BR>L&#40;30,19&#41; = &#40;round down &#40;&#40;30 &#43; 38&#41; / 35&#41; - 1 <BR> = &#40;round down &#40;~1.94&#41;&#41; - 1 <BR> = 1 - 1 <BR> = 0 weeks lost <BR>similarly, <BR>L&#40; 0, 0&#41; = -1 &#40;treat as 0 weeks lost&#41; <BR>and <BR>L&#40;30,20&#41; = 1 week lost <BR> <BR>Now where does one get values of F and S?  The following data was found on this board and credited to Dark Phoenix and Nevistar &#40;sadly, it is incomplete and I do not have access to a GameShark or the like&#41;. <BR> <BR>Agent &#40;Fatigue, Stress, Other&#41; <BR> <BR>Light Drill &#40;&#43;10, &#43;5, -? Form&#41; <BR>Light Drill Great &#40;&#43;5 ~ &#43;9, &#43;5, -? Form&#41; <BR>Light Drill Cheat ? <BR> <BR>Heavy Drill &#40;&#43;15, &#43;12, -?

Form&#41; <BR>&#40;This assumes a safe return to base camp&#41; <BR> <BR>Rest &#40;-33 ~ -47, -5 ~ -10, &#43;? Form&#41; <BR>Rest&#43; &#40;-43 ~ -55, -9 ~ -12, &#43;? Form&#41; <BR>&#40;This requires an active Lump of Ice / Fire Stone&#41; <BR> <BR>The following food data was collected by Dark Phoenix. <BR> <BR>Mango &#40;-10, -, &#43;1 Strict, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Form&#41; <BR>Nuts Oil &#40;-28, -, &#43;1 Strict, &#43;1 Spoil&#41; <BR>Nuts Oil&#43; &#40;-28, -20%, &#43;1 Strict, &#43;1 Spoil&#41; <BR>&#40;This effect only occurs in monsters with Arrow Head, Durahan, or Henger blood&#41; <BR> <BR>Mint Leaf &#40;-, -50%, -2 Spoil, -5 Form&#41; <BR> <BR>Tablet &#40;liked&#41; &#40;-, -15, &#43;3 Spoil, &#43;2 Fear, &#43;3 Form&#41; <BR>Tablet &#40;neutral&#41; &#40;-, -13, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;2 Fear, &#43;3 Form&#41; <BR>Tablet &#40;disliked&#41; &#40;-, -10, -1 Spoil, &#43;2 Fear, &#43;2 Form&#41; <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>Now to fit all of the pieces together.  I find it easiest to explain with an example: <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s assume a new game, for simplicity&#39;s sake. <BR> <BR>There are only so many ways to increase my monster&#39;s ability scores.  Of these, only drills, errantries, and battles are immediately available.  A new monster will not fare well in battle or in errantries, so it&#39;s down to drills.  Let us determine the optimal course of action, first optimizing for pure ability gain. <BR> <BR>Through extensive testing, I have found that drills will give a range of 4 possible &#34;Success&#34; values, with the absolute position of the range shifting in accordance with the stage of life.  &#34;Great&#34; values are all based on one of the 4 &#34;Success&#34; values of the current stage of life, and modify the primary statistic gain by 1-6 points &#40;I&#39;m not sure about the upper limit, but it&#39;s at least 6&#41;.  For example, a Light Drill while your monster is in its first stage of life might provide 1-4 points, with a possible &#34;Great&#34; range of 2-10.  In a few months, the same Light Drill might provide 3-6 points, with a &#34;Great&#34; range of 4-12. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s important to note that each stage of life has a Light Drill cap and a Heavy Drill cap.  For example, during early adolescence most monsters can get no more than 10 from a Light Drill and 15 from a Heavy Drill.  These caps are applied after all other modifiers, including the &#34;Great&#34; condition.  There is also a minimum gain statistic cap of 1 at all stages of life. <BR> <BR>Heavy Drills have a secondary gain and a loss statistic in addition to the primary gain statistic.  Only the primary gain statistic is affected by the &#34;Great&#34; condition.  The secondary gain statistic has a range of 4 values just like the primary gain statistic, and it shifts in accordance with the monster&#39;s stage of life as well.  While sometimes the secondary gain statistic is arranged from least to greatest in direct relation to the primary gain statistic, this is often not the case.  Instead, the highest possible secondary gain statistic value is usually paired with the second highest primary gain statistic, and the lowest possible secondary gain statistic is usually paired with the highest primary gain statistic. <BR> <BR>For example: <BR> <BR>&#40;Primary gain, Secondary Gain, Loss&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;&#43;14, &#43;2, -3&#41; <BR>&#40;&#43;13, &#43;5, -2&#41; <BR>&#40;&#43;12, &#43;4, -3&#41; <BR>&#40;&#43;11, &#43;3, -2&#41; <BR> <BR>From what I have seen, the loss statistic always has a range of 2, beginning at 1-2 in childhood, and peaking at 2-3 in adolescence. <BR> <BR>Back to the question at hand: Which type of drill is better for your new monster?  If you look purely at the question from an ability gain point-of-view, the answer depends on whether your monster is capable of earning more net points from a Heavy Drill than it could from a Light Drill.  Most monsters are not capable of this, because the numbers are so low across the board at this stage of life, so in general, new monsters should stick to Light Drills. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, if your monster is capable of earning more net points from Heavy Drills than Light Drills already, the next check condition should be whether over the same period of time it can earn more net points through Heavy Drills than Light Drills, calculating for life loss.  Use as many items as you can in the calculation &#40;max of one per week, obviously, plus 1 tablet every 4 weeks&#41;, with a rough formula of: <BR> <BR>LDG = Average Light Drill Gain <BR>HDG = Average net Heavy Drill Gain <BR>D = weeks spent on drills <BR>L = weeks lost to stress/fatigue <BR> <BR>G1 = LDG &#42; &#40;D - L&#41; <BR>G2 = HDG &#42; &#40;D - L&#41; <BR> <BR>if G2, maximized with items and scheduling, is still greater than G1, also maximized with items and scheduling, then go with that Heavy Drill program.  If G1 is greater than G2, go with Light Drills.  If they are equal, you might consider optimizing for money, which in general means going with Light Drills, because the amount of stress and fatigue caused by Light Drills is cheaper to manage. <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>A sample 1 month Light Drill cycle, with a single item optimization, as well as assuming the worst-case scenarios for Rest and Tablet usage: <BR> <BR>1st week: &#40;nothing&#41; Light Drill &#40;&#43;10, &#43;5&#41; <BR>-&#40;10, 5&#41; no life loss <BR>2nd week: &#40;nothing&#41; Light Drill &#40;&#43;10, &#43;5&#41; <BR>-&#40;20, 10&#41; no life loss  <BR>3rd week: &#40;nothing&#41; Light Drill &#40;&#43;10, &#43;5&#41; <BR>-&#40;30, 15&#41; no life loss <BR>4th week: &#40;nothing&#41; Rest &#40;-33, -5&#41; <BR>-&#40;0, 10&#41; no life loss <BR>Feeding: &#40;Tablet&#41; &#40;0,-10&#41; <BR>-&#40;0, 0&#41; back to 0, 0 <BR> <BR>This is a very simple example, because save for the Tablet, no expense is incurred, and no complex item optimization is used.  Mangos, Candy, and Powder may be used during such a cycle to control weight without life loss. <BR> <BR>Here is an example of a Heavy Drill / Light Drill cycle with more item optimization, still assuming worst-case scenarios for Rest and Tablet usage: <BR> <BR>-&#40;0, 4&#41; leftover from 2nd week <BR>3rd week: &#40;nothing&#41; Heavy Drill &#40;&#43;15, &#43;12&#41; <BR>-&#40;15, 16&#41; no life loss <BR>4th week: &#40;Mango&#41; &#40;-10, 0&#41; Light Drill &#40;&#43;10, &#43;5&#41; <BR>-&#40;15, 21&#41; no life loss <BR>Feeding: &#40;Tablet&#41; &#40;0,-10&#41; <BR>-&#40;15, 11&#41; <BR>1st week: &#40;Mint Leaf&#41; &#40;0, -5&#41; Heavy Drill &#40;&#43;15, &#43;12&#41; <BR>-&#40;30, 18&#41; no life loss <BR>2nd week: &#40;Mint Leaf&#41; &#40;0, -9&#41; Rest &#40;-33, -5&#41; <BR>-&#40;0, 4&#41; back to &#40;0, 4&#41; <BR> <BR>As you can see, there is a lot of flexibility with training cycles designed to prevent life loss, even if your monster hates tablets, and you don&#39;t have a Lump of Ice or Fire Stone. <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>Some generalizations for item usage optimization: <BR> <BR>Mango - Removes 10 points of Fatigue, so it can be used at points of the cycle to allow F &#43; 2S to increase without reaching 70. <BR> <BR>Nuts Oil - Removes 28 points of Fatigue, so it should be used either to reduce an F value between 10 ~ 28 to 0, or for to allow an increase of F &#43; 2S without reaching 70, by using it when the value of F is 28&#43;. <BR> <BR>Mint Leaf - Removes a percentage value of Stress, so it is most numerically effective when the value of Stress is high.  A cycle that maximizes Mint Leaf effectiveness would use Mint Leaves when the value of F &#43; 2S is just under 70 and the value of F is minimal. <BR> <BR>Tablet - Removes a constant value of Stress, so it is best used when the value of S is above this constant &#40;If your monster likes it, the condition would be when the value of S is at or above 15&#41;, but the value of F &#43; 2S is still belwow 70.  Often, this would be a week or two following the use of the Mint Leaf.  Since this item can only be given at the beginning of the month, you should plan your cycle and the associated item usage around the use of the Tablet. <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>When calculating net Heavy Drill gains, here&#39;s something else to consider: If the loss statistic for a particular Heavy Drill corresponds to a statistic that is already fairly low on your monster, ignore the loss statistic when calculating Heavy Drill gains.  What do I mean by this? <BR>Let&#39;s say your monster is entering adolescence and has only been doing light drills in Skill since its birth.  It has the following stats: <BR> <BR>Lif 100 <BR>Pow 110 <BR>Int 80 <BR>Skl 450 <BR>Spd 75 <BR>Def 120 <BR> <BR>Heavy Drills at this stage of life will have a loss statistic range of 2-3.  A statistic cannot go below a value of 1.  What does this mean for this monster?  Pull Drills decrease Speed and Swim drills decrease Intelligence.  With 25-40 drills, the statistic will drop down to 1, and cannot drop any further, but you can continue to train that drill, with 0 statistic loss.  75 to 80 points will be comparitively easy to replace after you have maximized the primary gain statistic of that drill.  Compare this to the possible &#34;default&#34; loss: on a Heavy drill with a primary gain of 20 and a loss of 2-3, maximizing Power &#40;from 110 to 950&#41;, the monster would need to drill 42 times.  That&#39;s a &#34;default&#34; loss of 84-126 points, compared to only 75.  When Power is maximized &#40;or at some other acceptable level&#41;, Leap drills can be used to make back the 75 points &#40;as opposed to 84-126&#41; of Speed.  While it is true that this would cause loss of Power, it would have been lost anyway, but done like this, you only lose the full amount of points in one attribute, not both. <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>If you are the kind of trainer that saves and loads consistently to get the kind of results that you desire, you might consider holding out for Heavy Drill results with the highest net gain statistic as opposed to just the highest primary gain. <BR>Using a previous example: <BR> <BR>&#40;Primary gain, Secondary Gain, Loss&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;&#43;14, &#43;2, -3&#41; <BR>&#40;&#43;13, &#43;5, -2&#41; <BR>&#40;&#43;12, &#43;4, -3&#41; <BR>&#40;&#43;11, &#43;3, -2&#41; <BR> <BR>It would be better in the long run to keep the &#40;&#43;13, &#43;5, -2&#41; as opposed to the &#40;&#43;14, &#43;2, -3&#41;.  You might even consider ignoring the loss statistic entirely, since the variance is so small. <BR> <BR>Sometimes, &#34;Great&#34; results aren&#39;t preferrable.  In the above example, getting a &#34;Great&#34; from the &#40;&#43;11, &#43;3, -2&#41; might result in &#40;&#43;15, &#43;4, -3&#41;.  Given the choice between that and &#40;&#43;13, &#43;5, -2&#41;, you might prefer the latter, seeing as the secondary gain statistic seems to be harder for this monster to increase.  On the other hand, &#34;Great&#34; results can quite easily generate net gains above any combination of the regular &#34;Success&#34; results. <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>When is the optimal time to battle your monster?  If the value to be optimized is money, then the answer is probably as soon as you can consistently win A-class battles.  Fight the D-class official tournament, then the C-class official tournament, leaving your monster in B-class.  That way all B-class and A-class unofficials are available, and among the prizes are Pure Silver, Pure Gold, and Pure Platinum.  The money made is on the same order of magnitude as S-class tournaments, fewer official tournaments are required to get there, the opponents are easier, and therefore, less money needs to be spent training up your &#34;money&#34; monster. <BR> <BR>However, if the primary purpose for battling your monster is to increase its abilities, then there are some conditions to consider: <BR> <BR>At the S-class level, battles can give between 8-16 points in each of three statistics.  Which statistics are increased and the magnitude of the increase is, as near as I can tell, completely random. <BR>&#40;Some trainers have had some success controlling the statistics by selecting and cancelling the respective drills before a battle, but my own experiences have shown a degree of correlation roughly equal to total randomness.&#41; <BR> <BR>Since the increased statistics are fairly random, it would be wise to consider the number of battles your monster will be competing and leave some margin for growth in some statistics.  3 maximized statistics means a 50% chance that you will receive no points in one of the three post-battle gains, and a 20% chance that you will receive no points in two of the three.  &#40;I have actually seen a no-points-gained scenario on a monster with 3 maximized stats&#41; <BR> <BR>Since the magnitude is independent of your monster&#39;s innate ability gain, battles provide an additional possibility to maximize statistics your monster is poor at gaining, not to mention a way for declining monsters to continue gaining large amounts of ability points. <BR> <BR>Consider a high-end spread of &#40;&#43;15, &#43;15, &#43;15&#41;.  According to DP, each battle decreases your monster&#39;s lifespan by 3 weeks, so the optimal time to use S-class battles for ability point gains is after your monster can no longer gain 45 net stat points per month through drills.  If you aren&#39;t saving and reloading, a more realistic approximation would be based off of estimated gains in the neighborhood of &#40;&#43;10, &#43;10, &#43;10&#41;. <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>... <BR> <BR>Hmm, I guess I lost my train of thought... <BR> <BR>Well, I hope that I have helped new ranchers on their way to devising their own training methods, and for the rest of you, I hope that I&#39;ve at least added something to our collective pool of knowledge. <BR> <BR>I will/am/have post/ing/ed the first result of my Monster Rancher 2 mechanics explorations in the Hall-of-Fame section of this board, a pure Kato named Scrappy. <BR> <BR>Happy Ranching, <BR> <BR> &#42;R&#42;

 .......daaaaaaaaaaaaamn....... <BR> <BR> <BR>In no way is my drill even close to this complicated. My advice for all trainers is to not follow other trainers leads. No offense, it just takes out of the game. Then you beat it and go, <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, I won.&#34; But then you think, &#34;No, it wasn&#39;t my training method.&#34; <BR> <BR>Everyone has a different style, some of us just have to train a while to unlock it.

 As I stated in the disclaimer, the post was in no way meant to be a training method, merely a starting point. <BR> <BR>I sought to collect what I thought was the pertinent information, a lot of which was already discovered, and present an analysis of it. <BR> <BR>As you say, each of us has a different style.  My intention was to provide some tools to help new trainers build their own.  And in the end, it was all their work...  There&#39;s no recipe here, only some examples.  Anything you make of this IS your own training method. <BR> <BR>&#42;R&#42;

 thanks &#34;r&#34;.  you deserve mention with the great one letter names, like &#34;o&#34; and &#34;q&#34;! <BR> <BR>this ties a number of good concepts into one neat package.  it is similar, in many ways, to a series of posts by &#34;have clue, will travel&#34;, which takes the package one step further and proposes a number of training methods based on the above assumptions.  anyone who liked this post would also enjoy reading hcwt&#39;s series.
