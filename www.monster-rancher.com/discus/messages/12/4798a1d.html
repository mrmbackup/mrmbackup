Phoenix-this monster is the father of all my rare monsters he was the first rare i got &#40;sniff sniff&#41;i dont know where i would be without my firebird after I got my phoenix i just started getting all my rare monsters .But off to the review this monster is god reincarnated he looks cool,his moves rock ,and nice attitude at the ranch almost never fails in its driils.I suggest raising it in intteligence,speed,and skill ,when fighting try to stay away from your enemy its up-close attacks are noting to be proud of,depend on your speed to raise your guts and when the time is right unleash the power of fire and watch your oppenent burn.Watch out for one hit wonders though a phoenix with low def. and life will burn out in one powerful attack from an opponent this is remideid with good speed.This a very,very,very good monster especially for begginers my first one made it only to a rank but that was good enough for me back then.  <BR> <BR>Zilla-I went too hell and back trying to get this monster.And let me tell ya this monster is nothing but a big fat tub of lard who cant move his own ass without the help of the trainer&#40;just kidding&#41;these monsters just tottaly disapoint me they are hard to raise keep asking for extra treats .They are strong at life and strength but what is strength if you cant even hit your opponent due to their awful skill.It is quite easy for its oppenents to hit it because of its terrible speed and to add insult to the injury for a monster thats good at power and life it has terrible defence.Recommended for trainers with experience not for begginers this monster had trouble getting past b class.In conclusion raising this monster was a tottal waste of time not worth the trouble.  <BR> <BR>next issue durahan and centaur  <BR> <BR>-- stupid &#40;<A HREF="mailto:twopacliveson@hotmail.com">twopacliveson@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>My Zilla&#40;the one I made with the beard&#41; has defeated all the major 4 &#40;finally beat astound&#41; and is waiting for a year to fight Poritoka &#40;white suezo&#41; since most will be to tough. he has 999 power and 400 or more in every stat except Int&#40;150&#43;&#41; These may be difficult to raise but, for a master trainer that is just another challenge awaiting his skillful hand.  <BR> <BR>-- tjmax &#40;<A HREF="mailto:tjmax@tnweb.com">tjmax@tnweb.com</A>&#41;, January 27, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>want a really good zilla? try a gooji &#40;zilla/tiger&#41;. i got mine beyond the 5000-pt barrier using azn-beast&#39;s method. his stats are:  <BR> <BR>lif-798 pow-999 int-821 ski-999 spd-626 def-999  <BR> <BR>i love zillas! :&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- MaJoBeRiDiOmEn! &#40;<A HREF="mailto:organomd@hvisions.com">organomd@hvisions.com</A>&#41;, February 21, 2000.
