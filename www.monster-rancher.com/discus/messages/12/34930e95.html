<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
Back when this board was on LUSENET, I recall a post by someone stating that if you rested your monster too much, you&#39;d get a warning from Colt about it. Well, now that we know so much more about how the game calculates stress/fatigue/lifespan on a weekly basis, the less sense this made to me, so I decided to test it out. <BR> <BR>I took the Mocchi from the MR2 disc itself, so anyone could replicate my findings. He started life Liking Tabs, Disliking Meat, Good natured. <BR> <BR>I fed Milk for 4 months, then just Tabs. <BR>No items were used. &#40;Mint, Peaches, etc.&#41; <BR>I rested every week, no visits to town. <BR> <BR>He got spoiled really fast and stayed at Doting all the time. I got the spoil warning all the time. His likes/dislikes never changed. <BR> <BR>Anyway, he got his first age warning on his 9th birthday, and died at 9y/4m/3w. <B>-And I never heard a word about &#34;too much sleep&#34;!</B> <BR> <BR>I must therefore conclude that this was a hoax, and any fears anyone may have had about rest are unfounded. This will also simplify my efforts to check lifespans of monsters off CDs! &#40;Checking how much variation is possible is one of my projects, see my post called &#34;That Crazy Monol&#34;.&#41;

 I&#39;ve &#34;raised&#34; several of the Zumms from the market this way, and they too have lived a little over 9yrs. &#40;I&#39;ve been wanting to post under this thread for ages&#41;

btw, here is the original thread, still a word file on my work hard drive: <BR>SUBJECT A,B,C,D IS GALI/PIXIE &#40;PINK MASK&#41; from the same cd A: sleep,sleep,sleep,sleep &#40;no item,no item,no item,no item&#41; died: 1 years 8 months B: sleep,sleep,sleep,sleep &#40;no item,no item,no item,mintleaf&#41; died: 2 years 3 months C: sleep,sleep,sleep,sleep &#40;mintleaf,mintleaf,mintleaf,mintleaf&#41; died: 2 years 5 months---&#62;loyalty:2 D: light drill, light drill, light drill, sleep&#41; &#40;no item,no item,no item,mintleaf&#41; died: 3 years 3 months  <BR>i choose this cd because from my experience, the gali from this cd have a shortest lifespan among my other CDs  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, January 05, 2000  <BR>Answers <BR>Now that&#39;s just.... wierd. Why on earth would a monster die if it lived a fatigue stress free life? The fact that mint leaves increased the lifespan shows that the monster got stress despite sleeping all the time too. WIERD. What food was it fed?  <BR> <BR>-- Tiamat &#40;<A HREF="mailto:sonofbahamut@hotmail.com">sonofbahamut@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, January 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Was the monster&#39;s fatness controlled? It has not been proven whether a fat monster will have a shorter lifespan.  <BR>Also, I think mint leaves reduce a tiny bit of weight. I remember feeding my &#34;normal&#34; monster a mint leaf and checked again to see that it was &#34;slim.&#34; However, I&#39;m not too sure whether I was just seeing things or what not since it was a long time ago when that happened.  <BR>I&#39;d like to hear more about this.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I keep telling people that Mint Leaves can&#39;t prevent stress, they can only heal it. To have an ideal, stess-free life, a monster MUST be allowed to work out its frustrations &#40;by trashing other monsters&#41;, or it will become mentally unstable and die sooner. That&#39;s just how it is. I spend 20 times the amount of money on Nuts Oil that I do on Mint Leaves because of that.  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure about the sleep thing or Nate contention that you must battle to heal your monster&#39;s stress, but mint leaves and smoked snakes DO have a slimming effect on your monster. Not to the degree that powder does, but a weight reduction all the same. Nuts oil on the other hand has a slightly fattening effect on your monster and also increases stress slightly.  <BR>Nate, I&#39;m not saying your wrong, but I have had great success with monsters who don&#39;t battle until three years old.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, January 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>all monster like are same: tablet &#40;i keep load from CD to make it same&#41; the dislike different: A:potato B:battle C:battle D:meat monster form before die: A:plump B:plump C:plump D:fat  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, January 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve found alternating Mint Leaves and Nuts Oil prevents stress completely. I tested this idea across several breeds, and it seems to be a solid method...  <BR> <BR>-- John &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rdjohn@ccms.net">rdjohn@ccms.net</A>&#41;, January 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Well, you can get rid of stress by playing instead of battling.. thats why even though your evil dragon likes &#34;play&#34; he will always ask to battle.. it reduces the stress the same amount. Trashing other monsters is a proven stress relief but there are other ways. a mint leaf every second day might be a bit much because in addition to its relief it has an effect &#40;i think the text is &#34;relaxes&#34; your monster&#41;. actually, if my savegame spelunking hgas shown me anything, this means it drops one tiredness level. Don&#39;t you wish you could get colt to rediagnose your monster for tiredness? you can sort of do it yourself by looking in the game saves. &#40;This is probably where the myth about mint leaves shortening life came from, because fatigue shortens life, and mint leaves used at the wrong time can cause you to hop the barrier to fatigue&#41;  <BR>As for the matter of constant sleep decreasing lifespan, i believe it is due to HP : i think more HP = more lifespan, and if your monster is resting, it isnt upping its hp. Fatness may have something to do with it too.  <BR> <BR>-- Jonas Trip &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rocketmallow@hotmail.com">rocketmallow@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, January 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>NO! I EVER RAISED A NINJA KATO. MY NINJA KATO ONLY HAS 126 LIF OR 136 &#40;I FORGET&#41;, IT LIF 5 YEARS AND 5 MONTHS WITHOUT ANY GOLDEN PEACH  <BR> <BR>-- ONOMIBA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ABIMONO@MAILCITY.COM">ABIMONO@MAILCITY.COM</A>&#41;, January 07, 2000.  <BR> <BR>There is a serious problem with this experiment, onomiba. You forgot to control the possible extraneous variable, &#34;form.&#34;  <BR>Nobody has tested the true effects of being skinny/plump and it is believed that being so will decrease lifespan.  <BR>I have also noticed that mint leaves decrease weight slightly. That would explain why your mint leaf fed subjects live longer. You can start to see a pattern: A&#41; Absolutely NO control of form = shortest lived. B&#41; Little control of form = 2nd shortest lived. C&#41; Heavy control of form = 2nd longest lived. D&#41; Extreme control of form = longest lived.  <BR>It seems that this pattern is telling us that your monster lives longer if its fatness is controlled better. Therefore, the connection between your testing data and your theory seems VERY fallible.  <BR>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a &#34;bad&#34; thing. I think it&#39;s a good thing that you took time to do this testing. Besides, you may have stumbled upon an answer of &#34;greater&#34; importance while you were at it. You may have just answered the question as to whether form affects lifespan or not!  <BR>In order to confirm this though, another test will have to be carried out. This time however, the training schedule will have to stay constant while form is manipulated with the usage of powders and candies.  <BR>Thanks for the input.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 08, 2000.

 The funny thing is, I was so afriad of rest for all this time! Now I can simply just rest all the way through to check out a lifespan, it&#39;s gonna cut my experiment time in half!
