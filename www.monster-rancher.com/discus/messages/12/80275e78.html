First things: Dragons are annoying! This is from my experience with Moo, who was the worst of the worst, but if i remember correctly, almost all dragons start out worst natured. And their bad natured Techs suck! But i will get into that later... first, stat gains &#40;completments of MePersoner&#41;: <BR>dragon/dragon    3 5 5 3 2 3 350 weeks  <BR>dragon/pixie     2 4 5 3 3 2 370 weeks  <BR>dragon/beaclon   3 5 3 3 2 3 370 weeks  <BR>dragon/henger    3 5 4 3 3 3 370 weeks  <BR>dragon/golem     3 5 4 2 2 4 390 weeks  <BR>dragon/durahan   3 5 4 3 2 4 410 weeks  <BR>dragon/arrowhead 3 4 4 3 2 4 410 weeks  <BR>dragon/tiger     3 4 5 4 3 2 380 weeks  <BR>dragon/gali      3 4 5 3 2 3 350 weeks  <BR>dragon/kato      3 3 5 3 3 3 430 weeks  <BR>dragon/bajarl    3 5 4 3 2 3 390 weeks  <BR>dragon/metalner  3 4 3 4 2 4 390 weeks  <BR>dragon/joker     3 4 5 4 2 3 350 weeks  <BR>dragon/monol     3 4 4 3 2 4 350 weeks  <BR> <BR>To chose the right dragon, you must decide what stats you want to focus on. I like to focus on Pow, Life, Skl, and Def, but you can substitute in speed and int if you wish. The best choice i feel is Dragon/Metalner, because it specializes in three of the four stats i mentioned, and is average in the fourth, plus the /metelner really brings up the guts regen &#40;Which is one of the dragons biggest problems&#41; and the lifespan &#40;which is the other dragon problem&#41; Other good choices are /tiger, /pixie, and /durahan, depending on what you are looking for. <BR> <BR>I will leave out baseline stats from now on to save lisa space; if you need them, they are under MR2&#62; Breeding and Combining&#62; Baseline stats for all breeds. <BR> <BR>As far as techs go, Dragons biggest problem is that they have VERY low guts regen, in fact, they have the slowest in the game. They also have a low lifespan, so errantries should avoided if possible. So the best strategy is to stick with low guts techs, and techs that have high accuracy, since you don&#39;t want to waste your guts on misses. The best attack for dragon i feel is Tail Attack, which is chained to Tail Whip. It is C/A/-/- for only 16 guts. This is key to dragons, since it is decent damage with a high accuracy. Withering and Sharpness are extras for a dragon, since raising these only add to guts. Other good attacks are Tail Whip, Wing attack, Trample, and Slamming Down. Slamming down is great against withering monsters, which i will explain later. If you are raising an Int. Based monster, Flutters is a must! It is B/A/D/E for 33 guts. This combination of High damage with a higher accuracy is great for dragons. Unfortunately, i don&#39;t raise Int dragons, so i passed. It has one Good attack, Glide charge, which is basically Tail attack with slight withering and sharpness for 11 extra guts. Although Tail attack is much better, it is good to fill in your far range attacks. The 2 bad attacks, Claw and Spinning Claw, are not worth it. They are both D accuracy, and cost a lot of guts for what you get. Avoid them <BR> <BR>Since dragons have lousy bad natured atttacks, your first priority when raising them should be to get rid of their bad nature. This is best done with &#91;LD/Sour Jelly, LD/Sour, LD/Sour, Rest/Sour&#93; use this until thier nature is either good or neutral, depending on what you like. I brought my Moo to neutral, and 3 years later, after constant praise and discipline, it still wasn&#39;t good, so they are hard to get over that line. While changing its nature, I reccomend working on Skill, but if you aren&#39;t rasing a skill dragon, work on whatever its weakest stat is that you want to raise, usually speed, defense, or life.  <BR> <BR>Once again, MePersoners methods are reccomended to raise this monster. I use &#91;Tablet/HD/NO, LD/ML, HD/NO, LD/ML&#93;, and train in Pull, Shoot, Swim, Shoot. This brings up every stat as evenly as possible, although Defense and Power usually shoot up during prime. Using this method, i brought my current dragon, Smaug &#40;Dragon/???&#41; up to 455/657/149/434/63/593, and he is only 3 yrs, 7 mos. If you are raising stats besides what i have chosen, just substitute whatever drills you want in. If you want int instead of Def, change Swim to Meditate and the second shoot to run. If you want speed instead of skill, do dodge instead of shoot. I highly recommend skill, though, since with their low guts regen, you want to make every hit count. <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t have enough money for this method, use MP&#39;s second method &#91;Tablet/HD, LD/ML, LD, Rest&#93; For Smaug, i would use Pull, Endure, Shoot, although you can substitute Dodge for shoot, or Meditate, Domino for Pull, Endure.  <BR> <BR>Peaches are highly recommended for dragons. Since they have the shortest lifespan in the game, peaches would really help them out. It is best to use them soon after prime, so they can live their prime twice, or even three times with two peaches. Do NOT use drugs, their life is short enough as it is. <BR> <BR>When battling, Dragons greatest weakness is Antagonizers. With their low guts regen, withering techs could ruin them. Fortunately, they start with Tail Whip, which has a low guts cost and high accuracy so you can chip away at enemies. Also, it is suggestible that you open up with a Slamming Down against witherers, since they will be draining your guts soon enough, you may as well use them yourself, and slamming down has decent accuracy and better damage. Against fast monsters, such as pixies and ghosts, stay close and use your high accuracy attacks. Against tanks, stay back, build up guts, and use trample, slamming down, and Flutters if you have it. For one hit wonders, Slamming Down is your best attack, followed by Flutters, Tail attack, and anything else that deals decent accurate damage quickly. Basically, you kill them before they kill you. Against combo king, just do what you feel is right. Above all, do NOT waste your guts on attacks that have less than 45% chance of hitting, and try not to go for anything less than 55%. <BR> <BR>Dragons can be good errentry monster if you focus on Int. They have decent life, and good power, making them perfect for errentries. If you are like me, and stay away from Int, don&#39;t bother going on errentries. You will get anywhere you want, but you won&#39;t find anything there. <BR> <BR>It is hard to say what monsters are good for combining with dragons. Since dragons can be brought up in so many different ways, it is hard to single out any good race for them to combine with. I would recommend Tanks and one hit wonders, however, since that is what dragons tend to be. It all depends on how you raise them. <BR> <BR>This is my second FAQ.

 Nice, if you plan on doing more of these, try straying away from hengers and bunnies, because those two I would like to do myself. <BR> <BR>Also, I would like to mention that although dragons have slow guts regen, they make up for it with the fact that generally speaking, they hit VERY VERY hard, and more often than most other monsters due to guts factor.

 Yeah, dragons are HIGHLY annoying since they start with a very bad attitude, and ask for too much things. Plus some even ask for tournament time that will cause decrease in their lifespan. And dragons are rumored to have the LOWEST lifespans of all. But when I combined it with another monster with higher lifespan, its nature got better and didn&#39;t die until 6 years 8 months. Despit its poor guts regenerating, its attacks are major cool and oh so powerful, so it&#39;s worth all the waiting.

 What???? you didnt make a mention of Dragon Combo. Thats a must if your training one to hit hard. Although it has a low hit%, when it hits it hits extremely hard and besides it looks cool. Other than that, looks good. Oh yeah like Mepersoner said, they have a very high guts factor which means IIRC they dont lose as much guts when withered against. &#60;--Wording doesnt sound to good there.

 What he means is their guts factor is insane.  One hit wonders with Dragon Combo hitting, can do massive damage, just like Cyclone. :&#41;

 I meant to mention Dragon Combo, but i forgot. I was going to say avoid it. Trample has the same Damage and Hit% for almost half the guts costs. Since dragons have an extremely low guts regen rate, i feel it just isn&#39;t worth it to risk 50 guts on an attack that most likely won&#39;t hit, especially when you can spend 27 on almost the same thing. I just don&#39;t think its worth 23 guts for a little bit of withering.

 new information from japan has confirmed what some trainers have been discussing for a while, djinn.  there is a big difference in the amount of damage done between trample and dragon combo.  if you go here  &#34;Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 2 Archive: Techs/Tech Chains: Tech Values According To Tecmo Japan: CP, Dragon, Ducken, Durahan, Gaboo, Gali&#34;  you will see that, although both are rated S, Dragon Combo has a value of 65 compared to 50 for trample.  That is as big of a difference as between a S and a B level tech.

 The difference, as I&#39;ve seen of S force techs, is between 49&#40;Fire Wave-Phoenix&#41; to 78.&#40;Cyclone-Golem&#41; <BR> <BR>The differences of techs does matter a lot.  Now, to differ Trample and Dragon Combo.  Trample is 27 for S E D E &#40;50, -16, 13, 5&#41; and Dragon Combo is 50 for S E B C.&#40;65, -20, 35, 15&#41; DC is 23 more for a lower accurate, stronger S force that can wither and be critical more often.  The problem is, is that it&#39;d take about 23 seconds to gain those 23 guts. :&#41;

 Yeah, i&#39;ve seen that, but i still think that it isn&#39;t worth it, just because dragons have a short lifespan and need to conserve errantries, and it will cost too many guts for an attack that most likely won&#39;t hit. A player can get almost 5 tail attacks for that cost, and they will all most likely hit. However, this is MY opinion, and i wrote my FAQ to encourage other players to try their own ways.  <BR> <BR>Also, a quick question about those tech values... i&#39;ve seen that before, but wasn&#39;t too clear what the numbers meant. Has anyone figured out if the numbers after the letter are relative to the letter &#40;IE, S 50 can only be compared to other S&#39;s&#41; or are they relative to every letter &#40;I.E., S 50 is just a step above A 49, and twice as powerful as C 25&#41;? Thanks

 The numbers are compared to other numbers.  Stab Throw was discovered by Hellraiser to be, quote &#34;Insanely Strong for an A Force Tech&#34;...and it is!  A49 power, is the same strength as the lowest S force tech Fire Wave from Phoenix.  Just go by how high the number is. <BR> <BR>As far as saving lifespan...errantries decrease 6 weeks automatically, out of 350.  It really isn&#39;t a waste, unless you know what you&#39;re doing by having enough skill to hit and how to battle right...

 Well, i decided to get Dragon Combo, and i must admit, it is pretty nice to have. It makes it a lot easier to fly through the M4 if dragons skill is high enough. In the Feb Battle, I was able to KO the Dragon/Joker and Joker/Pixie in one hit &#40;I forget their names&#41; but the Durahan/Durahan only took about 350 damage from it. Fortunately, i was able to wear him down with Tail Whip, but it was diffacult with the dragons guts regen, and i nearly lost. So while it is useful for a one hit KO, i still stick with my original statement that it is too costly in guts, and if it can&#39;t KO in one hit, it is best avoided
