We expect people who post methods to be advanced level ranchers, with an excellent grasp of the game, and the math behind it. &#40;If you cannot comprehend how people get all 999s on their monsters without bananas or without using a gameshark, you should not be posting methods.&#41; <BR> <BR>When a method is posted, the person posting it is setting themselves forth as a knowledgable person, worthy of being followed by other ranchers of <I>all</I> skill levels. We only trust people to instruct others when they do not need any instruction themselves, because to do otherwise would be to have the blind leading the blind. <BR> <BR>Remember that before posting a method, you are supposed to have read the FAQ thoroughly, and the Methods section. You should have an ease with the math involved, and be able to explain it in detail to other people correctly. You should also have tried the exisiting methods, and have a mastery of them, so you can explain in what ways your method differs. <BR> <BR>New methods should be posted in the Miscellaneous Q&amp;A section. All new methods posts must be complete. <I>All math for items values, stress, lifespan, etc. must be provided, as well as the weekly lifespan index numbers.</I> <BR> <BR>New Methods must also contain a detailed, mathematical explanation of why they are superior to the other posted methods in the Methods section.  <BR> <BR>Incomplete methods, those without the explaination of how they are superior, and those which cause lifespan loss will be deleted promtly. Potato methods will result in the author being banned. <BR> <BR>You are also not allowed to post <I>LD,LD,Rest</I>, <I>or all LDs with alternating Mint and Nuts Oil</I> or small variations thereof as a method. This is a basic technique that almost every new player tries and has been known since day one. You did not invent it. <BR> <BR>Overall, our Methods section is for the best of the best. We also expect users to not waste space in Misc Q&amp;A going over poorly constructed methods, or copies of other people&#39;s methods. We expect users to respect the fact that each post adds to my monthly bill, and to study subjects extensively before posting. <BR> <BR>We are also not actively seeking new methods, as most which are posted are simply attempts at fame for the author, and add little if anything to our knowledge of ranching.  <BR> <BR><B>We have simply left this section with instructions in the hope that someone may invent a radical new usage of an item, or system.</B> <BR> <BR>Essentially, most visitors to this site are long-time players of the game, and are very familiar with all the info, and don&#39;t need or want a new method. They can get all 999 monsters for the most part in the first generation with ease. <BR> <BR>The new players are often overwhelmed with data. And, they often will not use any method at all because at first it feels too much like they aren&#39;t really playing the game for themselves. Once they get a little success, they want to share it with others, thus, almost every n00b we see tries to post a method within a week of finding the site. They don&#39;t generally at this point read other methods. <BR> <BR>Thus, we have a quandry: lots of method makers, and virtually no method readers/users. <BR> <BR>Our advice is, do not waste your time, and our time posting a method until you have played 300&#43; MR game years, and you have taken 3 monsters of different main breeds and raised them to all 999s. Even then, think long and hard about who exactly you will be attempting to convince to read your method, and then, of those, what percentage will actually be convinced to try it.

Under Construction <BR> <BR><CENTER><B>Method Math for Beginners</B></CENTER> <BR> <BR>The key to calculating methods, and the place where most people err is in knowing the order in which the game registers events. Each week, at the end of the week when the screen goes dark, the game is calculating the Lifespan Index for that week. First, it takes the carryover numbers &#40;accumulated stress/fatigue and form, spoil, etc&#41; and adds them to whatever events happened that week &#40;drill, rest, battle, errantry&#41;. Then, items and foods values are applied. And, then the Lifespan Index is applied to the resulting numbers. <BR> <BR>For the sake of ease, I will start with just drills and rest in the demonstration formulas. You can read about battle and errantry and how to calculate those weeks here: <BR><B>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 2 Archive &#40;PSOne&#41;: FAQ: The Most Important Game Data: Lifespan: Effect of Stress and Fatigue</B> <BR>
