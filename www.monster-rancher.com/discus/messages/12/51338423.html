 Hi people, sorry its taken a while to reply to some of your questions here &amp; other places but have been very busy. I am currently setting up a Message Board, something like the one over at Monster-Rancher.com and I will post alot of my stuff up there including Rares List and any other request that you may have for the PAL version. That way, people can post alot more without putting some burden on Lisa having to worry about deleting topics and taking up too much of her webspace and give people a chance to ask general question if or when they need it.

 Ok, I got a copy of Abba Gold &amp; it doesnt give me a Gold Suezo but a Fly-eye. I also got a copy of the Corrs Talk on Corners but it doesnt give me a Tram but a Blue Plant &amp; my biggest disappointment was I also manage to get a copy of the Ladysmith Black Mambazo CD in the hopes of getting a MOO but got a pure Henger! Garlant, if you could post the data for the Gold Suezo CD, and the Tram CD would be greatly appreciated. I guess I know how you are feeling, all those people who got the Beck CD and got no Moo! Woe is me, LOL! I will keep looking.

 Hi, it`s me Mr.Bean. I`m sorry I cant use my name because i havent posted for ages and cant fin my name or password. Many have tried with the ladysmith C.D, however my freind has also tried it in an experiment and got moo. I know near to nothing about titles, pressings etc, but if anyone wants info just post it here.

 I thought i`d post this as of interest as a side part of our experiment. When we got the Ladysmith Black Mambazo disk, it was in awful condition with scratches all over. We bought a new copy with the same sentance of numbers written on the interior seethrough section of the disk. This gave an entirely different monster &#40;Blue Hare&#41;. I was wondering if scratches changed anything?

 Also I`m very sorry U.P, but I have had many more difficulties as well. Not just in tracking down the c.ds and them actually working, but the fact that they dont give the same thing for the PAL version. So imagine my delight when I found a Moo on one of my brothers c.ds he got of a freind. More apologies, as it can cost up to £10 for albums of the like. Also, I installed CloneCD and did everything correctly, and when I copied Moo for a comparison experiment I got a stupid Jell Mew thing instead!

 The PAL users would appreciate knowing exactly what CD you did get Moo off. And, the codes in the Laboratory section are only for the NTSC/NA version of the game. That&#39;s why we put warnings in the announcements at the tops of the sections there.

 It is becoming increasingly hard to uncover either the Ladysmith Black Mambazo C.D or the MR2 one, as we are moving house. I promise I`ll find it once I`ve moved. My freind however, may be able to give it quicker, as soon as his P.C is repaired. With many PAL users reporting completely different monsters, we would like to apologize and also further condone the fact that the amount of scratches &#40;and even a small crack in one part if I remember rightly&#41; may corrupt the data and that we simply got lucky.

 Right, this is getting too long and boring. I am warning other PAL game users that Ladysmith Black mambazo:The stars and the wiseman, may produce a Moo for you, but personally since only a handful have reported to me successfully, it is possible that only a few people may get this particular monster. I would also like to apologize to Lisa incase I sounded rude about the Jell Mew. BTW, I found that my brother did not buy the album: he origionally ordered a copy of Limp Bizkit:New Old songs but in a very rare mix- up he recieved the Stars and the Wiseman instead.

 Thanks Anonymous, I manage to get my hands on 3 different LadySmith Black Mambazo Cd&#39;s but not that one.... Now I know the title, I will try and get a hold of that one. Well one thing that makes it harder for PAL users is that since PAL format is available for many different countries, we not only have to deal with different pressing but other changes for CD&#39;s when produced in different countries such as bonus tracks or remastered CD&#39;s. So dont feel bad for me, I have no idea how many Cd&#39;s I&#39;ve shrined. But you know it comes with playing the game but like I&#39;ve said before, it can become quite tedious.

 From what I know I am not sure. Since I am in Australia and PAL is available here as well as in the UK and other places, I cannot verify if that is true. Because some CD&#39;s may have the same Distributor or label, they probably are made in totally different countries and there are of not of the same pressing plus some CD&#39;s when release in other countries may have something added done to them whether it be bonus tracks, digitally remastered or some other feature which really just creates even more havoc when looking for a certain CD. <BR> <BR>About scratches, I&#39;m not sure about that either. Some people over at MR.com claim to have gotten other monsters from scratch CD&#39;s but I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before except on 1 occassion where a CD was unreadable which gave me a striped shell, but when I tried again it gave an Antares. But I think it happened cause it was lightly scratched and it was during a session of mass shrining.

 Sorry I havent been playing MR2 lately. I got 6 weeks until I finish Uni. for good, but I&#39;ll probably get back into after I finish. I&#39;ll do a heap more shrining. Oh apparently Moo can be found on a LadySmith Black Mambazo Cd. I managed to get a hold of some but alas....no Moo.

 i hired the game out two years ago and had 2 rares then and one now&#40;i got the game about 1 1/2 weeks ago. no idea where sumopian or my current one, frog hopper &#40;training it now, obtained when round my cousins house. possibly some form of death metal&#41;. however, i dont know which, but my brother&#39;s s club 7 cd gave me the reggae plant i had. you might want to check that out as he has left the home and i hate s club 7.

 You also need to spcify what country the music CDs were pressed in. We have had problems with UK pressings vs AU pressings, meaning that we have a lot of angry AU users whose CDs do not work. UD pretty much posted his own discs without revealing any pressing info.

 i have been around a friends house shrining cd&#39;s for about 3 hours. we got through 341 cd&#39;s and only got one rare. a rare pixie/??? which we got of off a copy of medieval 2 &#40;AU&#41; burnt onto a sanyo blank disk using clone cd. &#40;the version on legendcup.com&#41; cant remember which pixie/??? it was though. it was the one that looks like its wearing a jacket. sorry if this isn&#39;t helpful. i can also post subcodes for all the cds in about 2 or 3 weeks when my home comp is working.

 also posting here to confirm that there is a version of abba gold that makes gold suezo on the pal version.  <BR> <BR>Also, does the UK/europe release have the same rare cd data as the australian one? I wouldnt think so as my first rare i found &#40;sueki suezo, my favourite money-maker&#41; was an australian press of a european band. if this is so, i would be able to use that list of mine that i got from a MR pal version forum that was archived on the internet archive. or, even just make cd&#39;s of white noise that is about the same length of the tracks on those cds, then if by some miricle they work, post the sub-code for authentification by the recent pal region visitor who gave me the subcode i needed for gold suezo. &#40;which makes me think that we might have a shared /??? subcode database&#41; &#40;and i feel old by just looking at that ancient post that i made&#41;
