Does anyone know if Metalners are any good. If so what are they good in? what are their best attacks? I dont want to have to raise one just to find out its a horrible monster. Has anyone actually beaten the game with a Metalner?  <BR> <BR>-- Damian &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Mendabar@aol.com">Mendabar@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 10, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Well all the stuff i know are that metalrens are evil by nature, try the &#34;acrhives&#34; &#42;shiver&#42; for more info  <BR> <BR>-- Earl &#40;&#62;&#62;&#62;@&#60;&#60;&#60;.com&#41;, March 10, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>The Metalner species is good at speed and defense, decent at skill, average at power and intelligence, and not so good in life &#40;I think&#41;. They are one of the best monster types for antagonists, trainers whose strategy is to battle by draining the guts of the opponent! &#40;A Plant species is a good example of an antagonist&#41; I forget, but I THINK that their best move was something about them turning into a UFO to attack.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Metalners have awesome gut recovery. Use this to make them even more annoying. Constantly withering away at the opponents life and still have guts to show for it. Metalners, if raised by a master, can be very awesome monsters. They take time to learn how to raise them and aren&#39;t your everyday type of monster. Try one out and see if you like them. They are good monsters though.  <BR> <BR>-- The Man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:djedmond@pinenet.com">djedmond@pinenet.com</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Metalners have the best skill raising abilities in the game, at the end of stage 1 in the shoot drill, my pure Metalner was making 7-8 points a drill. <BR> <BR>In order of Best to Worst: <BR> <BR>Skill <BR>Defense <BR>Life <BR>Power <BR>Speed <BR>Intelligen ce <BR> <BR>In other words, Metalners are awesome at skill, average at defense and life, pretty bad at power, and blow at speed and intelligence. Of course they have awesome techs and guts regen. Its up to you if you want to raise one.  <BR> <BR>-- Vheod &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Vheod@homail.com">Vheod@homail.com</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>The reason I ask is because I am not really sure how to raise one. And I dont even wanna waste my time if no one has ever gotten them anywhere in the game.  <BR> <BR>-- Damian &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Mendabar@aol.com">Mendabar@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I really enjoyed raining a metalner/pixie. She had the fastest guts recovery rate I have ever seen. Her skill and def. went up fast and I was able to beat classes with lower levels than most other monsters. i think I would have been able to get into the Big 4 and possibly win them if my son hadn&#39;t erased my game right in the middle of raising her. I think metalners are well worth it but don&#39;t expect many K.O.&#39;s, they are much better at withering techs.  <BR> <BR>-- Miss Carrie &#40;<A HREF="mailto:musicality1@earthlink.net">musicality1@earthlink.net</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Thank you all for your input I think I will try raising one now.  <BR> <BR>-- Damian &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Mendabar@aol.com">Mendabar@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Three things make a monster great in battle.  <BR> <BR>1&#41; guts regeneration speed  <BR> <BR>2&#41; tech relevance and efficiency  <BR> <BR>3&#41; tech execution time  <BR> <BR>However, guts regeneration is THE most important. Since a metalner has its share of low-guts usage techs, a decent spread of withering and heavy hitting techs, above average tech execution times, and THE best guts regeneration in the game, I have reason to believe that they are the best battling monsters in the game.  <BR> <BR>Note that one of the reasons why metalners are so crappy at overall stat aquisitions, not so good tech variety in terms of INT/POW based techs, and has one of the worst lifespans of all species, is because they are probably the best monsters in the game, when all other battling conditions are held constant.  <BR> <BR>If you can get a metalner with 999 in all stats, which is possible by using Dark Phoenix&#39;s method&#40;probably the only method that can do it&#41;, then it will usually take out any other non-metalner monsters with 999 in all stats. Some monsters like the ducken, the ghost, or wracky, may pose some threat, because they all have high guts regeneration. But in the long run, metalner will have the most winning outcomes.  <BR> <BR>It is important to note that I say metalners are the best &#34;battling&#34; monsters in the game. This does not mean that they are the easiest to raise. In fact, I think they are the most difficult monsters to max out. Most monsters in the game are quite balanced in terms of overall raisability, however, when all monsters have the same stats, the truth will be shown. Especially if you pit a maxxed out metalner against a maxxed out golem, you may see some &#34;slight&#34; disadvantages.  <BR> <BR>Damian, be warned: if you raise a metalner, do not expect it to do so well in the beginning. After a few generations, and a REALLY good raising method&#40;ie, Dark Phoenix&#39;s&#41;, will you finally realize the true potential of monster rancher&#39;s ultimate contender. Good luck!  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, March 12, 2000.

 My Neemoi &#40;a pure Metalner&#41; easily trashed the M4.  Look for my Battle Strategies for Various Monsters post for a in-depth analysis of how to beat other monsters with Metalner easily.
