 I wasn&#39;t sure where I should post this, but I couldn&#39;t find it anywhere else on the site. According to the information provided by Dark Phoenix and NeviStar, I believe that having 10 Artemis Statues in your inventory would shave 2 weeks off of the 6 week hit for errantries. <BR> <BR>Lifespan index= Fatigue &#43; &#40;2 &#42; Stress&#41; <BR>LI 71-105  = -1 week <BR>LI 105-140 = -2 weeks <BR>Errantry &#43;18 fatigue, and &#43;7 stress per week. <BR>&#40;Above info courtesy of NeviStar and DP&#41; <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s how I see it. Start off with fully rested and relaxed 0,0 monster. <BR> <BR>0,0    &#40;LI= 0&#41; Always rest and item-up with whatever it takes to be &#34;very well&#34; the week prior to the errantry. I nut oil the beastie right before shipping him off, it seems to help. <BR> <BR>week 1  <BR>18,7   &#40;LI= 32&#41;  Statues= no effect <BR>week 2 <BR>36,14  &#40;LI= 64&#41;  Statues= -3 fatigue &#40;33&#41; <BR>week 3 <BR>51,21  &#40;LI= 93&#41;  Statues= -10 fatigue&#40;41&#41; -1 week <BR>week 4 <BR>59,28  &#40;LI= 105&#41; statues= -10 fatigue&#40;49&#41; -1 week <BR>&#34;Bug hit&#34;  <BR>59&#40;49&#41;,28 &#40;LI=105 OR 95&#41; = -1 week <BR> <BR>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, &#91;and before too many people stuff their inventories with statues ;&#41;&#93; But is my math correct? Wouldn&#39;t the &#39;bug hit&#39; be lessened by another week REGARDLESS of whether the statues worked before THAT hit? Oviously this is cutting it razor close with the LI=105, but I have little trouble getting my monsters rested fully b4 an errantry run &#40;I am gonna get myself &#34;12&#34; Statues&#41;. Also, the statues would save you from even LARGER life hits, should your monster be slightly less than fully rested. So, it seems like its worth it, to me. I do love getting techs... <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also like to point out that the Gemini pot would do absolutely NOTHING during these 4 weeks, and hence has lost all value in my eyes, forever ;&#41;

You should never post something when already half-asleep ...oBviously. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>The second lifespan hit should read <BR>LI 106-140 = -2 weeks &#40;My mistake&#41; <BR> <BR>I was also curious if Inventory items even <I>have</I> any effect while your monster is on an errantry. If not, it kinda fudges the whole deal, no?

 Interesting idea that should work, the only problem being the annoyance of having the 12 statues in inventory, taking up space, until you were done with errantries. You could shark them in right before each errantry to make things easier. &#40;Since I am assuming that most people would shark the 12 there to start with, to save a ton of time.&#41; <BR> <BR>Good job!

 Unfortunately, I have to get the statues the old fashioned way ;&#41; No GameShark, yet, for this poorboy. Which is why my training &#34;method&#34; involves weekly visits to the store :&#41; As for having only 7 &#40;12 statues, 1 Lump of Ice/FireStone&#41; leftover slots for expeditions... Seems fair to middlin for me, since I only go with Kavaro for Peaches, anyway. I&#39;m gonna get all my numbers together and write up my training &#34;method&#34; to see what you all think. If nothing else, at least it&#39;ll show me where my errors lie 8&#41;

 Don&#39;t forget the strong glue, which won&#39;t go away! I wasn&#39;t thinking expeditions, just the convenience of shopping in bulk. I seem to only go on expeditions now to grab peaches.

Yeah, I miss the sales a <I>little</I> bit. But I&#39;ve noticed that monsters never seem to ask for an extra nuts oil if you already have any of them in your inventory. Pair this with my substitution of battles for mint leaves to relieve stress, and you&#39;ll see why even 6 slots &#40;didn&#39;t know you were stuck with the glue, pardon the pun&#41; is plenty for the &#34;Peach Runs&#34;, and still leaves room for a silver peach or two 8&#41;

Thanks! Just read that one and its a great help. Lets me know that I&#39;m on to something, yet perhaps not truly a pioneer ;&#41; I just noticed that I fudged the math in the starting post, because I misread the information of LifeSpan hits &#40;Totally my own fault&#41;. It should be 105-139 takes a 2 week hit. Am I right? If so, then 11 statues would be <I>needed</I>, not my proclaimed 10. Sorry about that. Another reason not to do such things when in a half-dream state ;&#41;

 It is probably the chart&#39;s arrangement that is confusing. The first three column&#39;s are the stats at the end of the previous day, when they are checked for lifespan hits. The very first thing adjusted for after the LI check is statues, then tablets, then items then drills... Then the LI is checked at the end of the day for Lifespan hits. <BR> <BR>I placed them at the beginning of the chart hoping to make the LI check clearer ;&#41; I should have explained it a bit better, certainly.

An excellent point! Not that it matters in this case, since even if it <I>was a weekly effect</I>, they&#39;d still be worthless ;&#41;  <BR> <BR>It seems I wasn&#39;t the only person who missed this detail, but DP and NeviStar DO say &#34;beginning of each MONTH&#34; and not WEEK. That&#39;s precisely why I posted, to allow this work to be scrutinized,verified, and/or falsified. Well done!

Perhaps+I%27m+missing+something+here%2c+but+the+info+I+read+on+%0aArtemis+statutes+in+this+archive+claimed+they+only+work+at+%0athe+beginning+of+the+month
<!-/Source: 61663-!>
<!-Source: 61664-!>
It+is+probably+the+chart%27s+arrangement+that+is+confusing%2e+The+first+three+column%27s+are+the+stats+at+the+end+of+the+previous+day%2c+when+they+are+checked+for+lifespan+hits%2e+The+very+first+thing+adjusted+for+after+the+LI+check+is+statues%2c+then+tablets%2c+then+items+then+drills%2e%2e%2e+Then+the+LI+is+checked+at+the+end+of+the+day+for+Lifespan+hits%2e%0a%0aI+placed+them+at+the+beginning+of+the+chart+hoping+to+make+the+LI+check+clearer+%3b%29+I+should+have+explained+it+a+bit+better%2c+certainly%2e

actually%2c+the+question+I+have+is+when+does+the+statute+effect+%0atake+place+at+the+beginning+of+the+month+or+every+week%3f
<!-/Source: 61670-!>
