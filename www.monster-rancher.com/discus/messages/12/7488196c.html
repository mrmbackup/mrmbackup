<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
&#40;Message From Lisa: This Method is an older Method, created before we had a lot of hard data available. Please read the FAQ information carefully before attempting this. We are primarily archiving it as a part of our history.&#41; <BR> <BR>INTRODUCTION:  <BR>                Hi, people this is a guide I compiled after playing monster  <BR>rancher 2 for more than 2 months. I found that mr2 has loads of factors that  <BR>determine your monster’s lifespan like stress, number of errantries and many  <BR>more. My guide should cover most of this factors! As we know they are some  <BR>people I would like to call this people jabronis!&#40;fakes&#41; who keep bragging  <BR>about their stats! But obviously when asked about how to this people raise  <BR>their monsters , they don’t answer !Bah, gameshark users! Well, I am not one  <BR>of this liars! Now, you people can commence reading my guide. &#40;sorry I was  <BR>full of hot air&#41;  <BR>STEP ONE  <BR>When your monster is less than a year old do the following:  <BR>Two light drills, rest, two light drills, rest… just repeat until it is more  <BR>than a year old.  &#40;Why don&#39;t I use three drills because my monsters usually  <BR>get stressed out using three light drills.  But there are monsters that can  <BR>withstand three light drills without getting stressed out.&#41;  <BR>Also don&#39;t enter any battles until it is more than a year old.  Note: If  <BR>your monster gets spoiled just give it a smoked snake and smoked snakes do  <BR>not decrease life span!  <BR> <BR>STEP TWO  <BR>Ok, now your monster is more than a year old hurray!  Do the following:  <BR>One heavy drill, two light drills, rest, one heavy drill, two light drills  <BR>and rest. After this, join a tourney to relieve stress. . then repeat the  <BR>cycle. You may ask why don&#39;t I just repeat the cycle without  <BR>joining a battle. The answer is plain and simple it will get stressed out!  <BR>Also you might ask, why won&#39;t I use two heavy drills because your monster  <BR>will get stressed out easily if you send it on two heavy drills! One of the  <BR>major factors of the monster&#39;s life span is the stress factor &#40;remember  <BR>that&#41;.  <BR> <BR>MY VIEWS ON DRILLS  <BR>            Yah I found that a lot of people who used this drill time table  <BR>had problems in the stress department &#40;especially for people who just  <BR>started mr2&#41; .So I suggest to solve this problem u should kind of customize  <BR>my method. By doing three light drills instead of doing one hard drill, two  <BR>light drills! Some people found this three light drills thing help them a  <BR>lot in reducing stress! My point is u don’t have to follow my drill time  <BR>table after first year of your monster’s life! Note: I use this drill time  <BR>table as it does not stress my monster out! I have included this items to  <BR>help me to reduce stress like a firestone, Gemini pot, artemis statue, lump  <BR>of ice! This items help me a lot in reducing stress that’s why my monster  <BR>never get stressed out with my drill time table!  <BR> <BR>MORE ABOUT DRILLS  <BR>         When the monster likes a certain drill, the chances of it getting  <BR>great in that drill is higher. Also punish your monsters occasionally  <BR> <BR>A BIT ABOUT EVIL MONSTERS  <BR>        Silver henger told me not to punish evil monsters as punishing them  <BR>would decrease their lifespan. That’s only one thing I know about evil  <BR>monsters. Thanks for the tip Silver henger!  <BR> <BR>MORE ABOUT STRESS  <BR>        It seems that they are certain monsters which get stressed out  <BR>easily like pixies! So like I said just customize my drill time table due to  <BR>differences in stress levels for every monster!  <BR> <BR>STEP THREE  <BR>Also feed your monsters mangos after every battle and this keeps your  <BR>monster happy. Note: it is very important to keep your monster happy by  <BR>giving whatever items your monster asks for! I know there are some people  <BR>who have heard that giving your monster loads of items will decrease its  <BR>life span, right? Well, it is all false info. Giving items to your monster  <BR>doesn&#39;t. At last here is an equation I developed.  Happy monsters&#43; items it  <BR>wants=Longer life span!  <BR> <BR>MY EXTRA TIPS ON CONTROLLING STRESS, KEEPING YOUR MONSTER’S STYLE ON EVEN OR  <BR>SOFT, USAGE OF MINT LEAVES!  <BR> <BR>·            Use mint leaves before they get stressed out.  Like check the first  <BR>month whether get stressed out.  If they do, reset the game and give it a  <BR>mint leaf before the first week of the month and you will all see that the  <BR>stressed out message doesn&#39;t appear on the 1st week of the month anymore.  <BR> <BR>      I usually use smoked snakes when my monster’s style go to fond or soft  <BR>but make sure if it give it a smoked snake don’t go to strict. The reason  <BR>why is if your monster is at the strict style ,your monster will live a  <BR>shorter life and get high stats gain for a short time&#40;meaning a short  <BR>peak&#41;.But if you keep your monster’s style at fond it will live a longer  <BR>lifespan but with lower stats gains! So that’s why I always keep my  <BR>monster’s style at even or soft.  <BR> <BR>LOYALTY VIEWS  <BR>               I know u all say that mystic snakes decrease loyalty but by  <BR>giving your monsters items after every battle &#40;the items it ask for that is&#41;  <BR>counteracts this problems. Meaning this item battle thing will increase your  <BR>loyalty so don’t worry about the usage of smoked snakes.I know also the  <BR>problem of low loyalty when your monsters are only a few months old, so my  <BR>solution is be patient train your monster according to STEP ONE then when it  <BR>reaches STEP TWO then u can start battling to increase loyalty&#40;that’s the  <BR>stuff!&#41;  <BR> <BR>BATTLES A GOOD PLACE TO GAIN LOADS OF STATS  <BR> <BR>·            Also I usually stay in the B-class for more than three years.  Cause  <BR>the B-class battles are usually on  <BR>The  2nd week of each month or rarely the B-class battles are on the 4th  <BR>week of a month.  So, this is perfect for the heavy drill, two light drills,  <BR>and rest method.  Imagine once you finished a B-class tourney in the 2nd  <BR>week, after giving it a mango and resting, your monster, it will be on right  <BR>track.  <BR>·           Ok, just follow my method I mentioned in Step 2.  Then, use a mint  <BR>leaf and do a heavy drill then rest . Then, you&#39;ll enter a B-class battle at  <BR>the 2nd week to relieve stress.  If the next tourney of the B-class in on  <BR>the forth week.  Then, do one heavy drill, two light drills, rest, rest, two  <BR>heavy drills, then you will be ready for the B-class tourney.  <BR> <BR>STEP FOUR  <BR>You all might ask, &#34;Hey dude, what about the errantries?&#34;  My tip is to go  <BR>to errantries to get moves with like C-force, S-hit.  Accurate and powerful  <BR>moves preferbaly! In my Kato raising I sent him to 3 ski and 1 def errantry.  <BR> <BR>ERRANTRIES  <BR>              Bah, as you all can see that obviously with this number of  <BR>errantries. My monster will surely have not many moves. Well, I have to say  <BR>it is quality of  the moves not the quantity. It is no use to have tons of  <BR>useless and inaccurate moves.  <BR> <BR>STEP FIVE  <BR>Lastly u all can customize the tip number 2 by putting errantries in  <BR>between.  Note: only send your monster only when it is more than a year old!  <BR>  Also, don&#39;t send your monsters on too many errantries.  I suggest four at  <BR>a minimum.  More errantries = shorter life span.  <BR> <BR>~-~You might ask, &#34;Why is this jabroni giving us his raising method does he  <BR>have a catch or something?&#34;  Yes, I have a catch that is to credit me in  <BR>this raising method if it is successful and also spread the word of my  <BR>raising method to other people if u people like it that is. ~-~  <BR> <BR>I have raised two ninja Katos, a second generation Kato and a phoenix with  <BR>this method.  &#40;Currently I&#39;m raising a second generation tombstone with  <BR>stats Life and Defense =250, Skill =449, Intelligence =417, Power=150.&#41;  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>        First Ninja Kato &#40;lived for 8 years 5 months&#41; named Master stats  <BR>        are:  <BR>        NOTE: This is a first generation monster  <BR> <BR>Win, loss and ko record:112w 0l 98 ko  <BR>Techs: Slash claw, Thrust claw, Tornado claw, Twister claw, Phantom  <BR>claw, Hopping claw, Oil drinking  <BR>Money made:221850 g  <BR> <BR>Life =545  <BR>Power=150  <BR>Speed =999  <BR>Intelligence =999  <BR>Skill=999  <BR>Defense=390.  <BR> <BR>         Second Ninja Kato named The Assasin  &#40;lived for 8 years11months&#41;  <BR>         NOTE: this is a first generation monster  <BR> <BR>Win,  lose ,ko record:114w 0L 96ko  <BR>Techs: Slash claw, Thrust claw, Tornado claw, Twister claw, Phantom claw,  <BR>Hopping claw  <BR>Money made: 210450g  <BR> <BR>Life =672  <BR>Power =152  <BR>Intelligence =999  <BR>Speed =999  <BR>Skill =999  <BR>Defense =473.  <BR> <BR>Note: The only difference my second ninja Kato is it got more items I mean  <BR>the items it ask for that is!  <BR> <BR>        Kato named Clawz &#40;lived for 9 years 4 months&#41;Note:IT IS A SECOND  <BR>        GENERATION KATO!  <BR> <BR>Win and loss record:136win 1L 115 ko  <BR>Techs: Slash claw, Thrust claw, Tornado claw, Twister claw, oil  <BR>drinking  <BR>Money made: 306650g  <BR> <BR>Life =999  <BR>Skill =999  <BR>Speed =999  <BR>Defense =908  <BR>Power =195  <BR>Intelligence =999  <BR> <BR>       Lastly my Phoenix named Flamin Brid &#40;lived for 7 years 10 months&#41;  <BR>       NOTE:This is a first generation monster  <BR> <BR>Win and loss record:100w 1L 75ko  <BR>Techs: Beaks, Talons, Fire twister, Fire stream  <BR>Money made: 136900g  <BR> <BR>Life =701  <BR>Power =140  <BR>Intelligence =951  <BR>Speed =918  <BR>Skill =930  <BR>Defense =395  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>THE USAGE OF GOLDEN AND SILVER PEACHES:  <BR>        Use the peaches only when your monster’s peak is going down! This part of  <BR>the guide is very important for high stats gain BE SURE NOT TO MISS THIS  <BR>PART ABOUT PEACHES!  <BR> <BR>MY RANKING STATS SYSTEM  <BR>Also I usually raise one rank per year.  Here are my limits to going to each  <BR>rank.  <BR> <BR>Go to D-rank when 3 stats are over 250 &#40;three stats like Power/  <BR>Intelligence, Skill, Defense/ Speed.&#41;  <BR>Go to C-rank when three stats over 350.  <BR>Go to B-rank when stats are over 450.  <BR>Go to a-rank when stats are over 650.  <BR>Lastly go to s-rank when three stats over 750  <BR> <BR>READ THIS ONLY IF U HAVE PROBLEMS KEEPING YOUR MONSTERS LOYALTY AT 90 OR  <BR>MORE.  <BR>If it become spoiled jus use a smoked snake.Ok i did it this way ,when my  <BR>monsters loyalty go to 90&#43; it&#39;s style is even. I keep giving him the items  <BR>he wants. Eventually loyalty will become below 90 and style will change to  <BR>soft. Here, is the time to use it-use it when the loyalty drop to 85.After  <BR>giving it a smoked snake your monster&#39;s loyalty will go to 90 to the style  <BR>even. If u give your monster a smoked snake when the loyalty is more than 85  <BR>let&#39;s say 86, your style will become strict. So, give it a smoked snake when  <BR>it&#39;s loyalty drops from 90&#43; to 85.Hope that helps.  <BR> <BR>OPTIONAL TIPS  <BR>       Resetting is part of the game, which will gain you high stats &#40;no it  <BR>is not cheating.&#41;  Sometimes, I reset the games five times to get great in my  <BR>drills only when the monsters like the drill.  <BR> <BR>MY CONCLUSION  <BR>       At last, this is what I have to say.  From my research I found that  <BR>monsters will do great more in drills when they are happy!!!!!  Thanks for  <BR>listening.  If you have any questions just Email me.  I hope the Azn-beast  <BR>method works for you all! Also if you all use this method be sure to post  <BR>your stats on the messageboard!  <BR> <BR>EDITED BY AZN-BEAST  <BR>From: south-east asia, Brunei &#40;currently in uk&#41; <BR>Age:21

 Jut s afew comments on this message. <BR> <BR>I use a very similar &#39;method&#39;, and am very happy with it.  I don&#39;t like to bother with using lots of items, so the Nuts Oil/Mint Leaf methods aren&#39;t for me.  In much the same way you do, I train baby monsters with two light drills, then rest, after 8-14months &#40;depending on how the monster grows&#41; i move to three light drills, then once it is in it&#39;s prime one heavy drill, two light drills.  I&#39;m pretty happy with it because i don&#39;t need to contsnatly use items, and an occasional battle &#40;2-3 per year&#41; will clear up any stress problems.  Most of my monsters live well over six years doing this, and would probably live longer if I didn&#39;t freeze them.  One thing I would like to add is that I _always_ feed tablets.  I do feed milk for the first few weeks, but after that, it&#39;s always tablets, they are the best food no matter what. <BR> <BR>However, there are a few comments in your message that I think are false.  If anyone can back aznbeast up, please do so, but I don&#39;t believe the following to be true: <BR> <BR>Liking drills = more Greats: I&#39;ve looked into this quite a bit myself, and don&#39;t believe it.  I haven&#39;t seen an increase in the chance of getting a &#39;Great&#39; or the number of points gained when a monster likes a drill &#40;this is when the monster does it&#39;s &#39;like&#39; animation when you select the drill&#41;.  If there is an benefit, I believe it is a reduction in fatigue and/or stress from that drill.  However, I&#39;m beginning to believe it is just a way that the game lets you know which stats your monster is betetr at raising.  For exmaple, my Golem/Durahan often &#39;likes&#39; Domino, Endure, Pull, and Swim, and &#39;dislikes&#39; Shoot and Study.  Those are just what it&#39;s good and bad at. <BR> <BR>Punishing evil monsters = shorter life: I don&#39;t believe this one bit.  Punishing an evil monster has no different effect than punishing a good monster.  Punihsing does raise stress, hoever, so if you punish any monster, make sure you watch the stress. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s alot of info here about giving certain items to monsters &#40;mangos, apple cakes&#41; to keep it happy.  I urge everyone who reads this to also read the items section in the MR2 FAQ here &#40;MR2-&#62;FAQ-&#62;what items do&#41;.  It will explain what effects each item has.  The only items that have an effect on lifespan are the gold and silver peaches; the only other lirespan effects you&#39;ll see are from stress and fatigue. <BR> <BR>Strict = shorter lifespan: This is not true. <BR> <BR>One thing I would like to add to this: Errantries greatly reduce lifespan.  Going on 4 errantries will lose you approx 1/3year of lifespan.  The best idea for getting lots of techniques is to make every serious monster at least a second-generation monster.  For example, if you want a Suezo/Plant &#40;and who doesn&#39;t? heh&#41;, First raise a Suezo and a Plant seperately.  Get lots of tehcniques with these two monsters, and don&#39;t really worry too much about stats.  Techs are much easier to transfer over than stats, so you should be able to get a Suezo/Plant with lots of techs and slightly above-average stats by combining them.  You can get lots of techs without greatly reducing the lifespan of your &#39;good&#39; monster.

 for me my monster likes the drills i get more greats i did a little research proven to be true.  <BR>that&#39;s on my own experience though  <BR> <BR>i remember i did a test when i punish my evil monster it grew faster. Then i reloaded a save which i didn&#39;t punish him it didn&#39;t grow that fast nor it did not reach it&#39;s prime as quickly when i punished it . <BR> <BR> <BR>Strict = shorter lifespan i tried it out as well when i was strict to a monster it seemed to reach it&#39;s prime quickly while if i kept it&#39;s loyalty without being strict or making it&#39;s spoiled it lives longer.... <BR> <BR>coz my method the whole theory is based on the &#39;happiness&#39; theory. The more strict you are the less happy it is . <BR> <BR>basically also i see rewarding a monster with a mango or anything it likes ....increases the happiness points which i like to call it.Thus it lives longer... <BR> <BR>that was my view back two years ago when i produced this guide.It worked for a lot of people. <BR>and my view is still the same. <BR> <BR>thanks for the constructive critism.I know they are quite a number of flaws on my guide hehe... <BR>but basically i just posted this guide for historical reasons i just want to let ppl see one of the big guides of 1999. <BR> <BR>actually i don&#39;t really expect people to follow this.As i read the present guides which are far more descriptive and helpful than mine:&#41;

 I&#39;ll  look into the drill thing and jot down some numbers.  I did it a long time ago and didn&#39;t come up with anything, so I&#39;ll try it again.  The only things greats seem to be related to is the nature of the monster, a better monster gets more greats, a worse monster cheats more often.  Since your &#39;method&#39; of rewarding monsters tends ot make them &#39;good&#39;, it may be that effect you&#39;re seeing instead. <BR> <BR>And, it&#39;s pretty well proven that spoil/fear do not affect lifespan, only loyalty.  You can check out the FAq section if you want more info.  The items you mention only affect the spoil/fear ratio, which changes loyalty, and has nothing directly to do with lifespan.  There isn&#39;t any argument about it, giving magoes and apple cakes has nothing to do with lifespan, period.

 ok Bcampbell like i said it&#39;s for historical reference <BR> <BR>i have nothin more to argue about=&#41; <BR>anyways it was 2 years ago before this mango research is done but i&#39;ll stick to my belief=&#41;

 I have to go with Azn on this one. At least for the liking=great. I&#39;ve had more monsters than I can count who got more &#39;greats&#39; on drills that the did like animation for, and more &#39;cheat&#39; on drills that they did &#39;dislike&#39; animation for. <BR> <BR>And as for punishing, Azn: that&#39;s probably because the punishment pushed your monster&#39;s stress levels into the &#39;deadly&#39; levels, losing you some lifespan. That would be my best guess.

 It&#39;s quite severe, yes. However, back when this was first posted, the &#39;monsters losing life in battles&#39; hadn&#39;t been proven. Also, this isn&#39;t for raising long-lived monsters. It&#39;s for raising moneymakers, and good-statted creatures. And let me tell you: it _will_ kill your monsters fast, but once you get to those high-level battle areas, it _will_ raise the stats quite a lot. And it _will_ make you money. <BR> <BR>Out of every three or four monsters I raise, one is raised using this style, pretty much. And the monster makes enough money to pay for the next few monsters. On a _rigorous_ style of no battles and lots of food. So in my mind, it&#39;s still a valid idea, even if the life loss is there.
