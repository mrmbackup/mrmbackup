This is weird. For the first time I was really harsh when raising a monster. It went from &#34;strict&#34; to &#34;harsh&#34; to &#34;spartan&#34;. I never knew about the &#34;spartan&#34; thing and I was wondering if anyone else had noticed it before.  <BR> <BR>-- The Man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:djedmond@pinenet.com">djedmond@pinenet.com</A>&#41;, March 28, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>ya, it&#39;s being as cruel as possible. you &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;  <BR> <BR>-- legendary master moo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:homer@usaserve.net">homer@usaserve.net</A>&#41;, March 28, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Actually I have had that happen to me when I tried to kill a Muddy Jell&#40;no offense to jells, it was just the only monster I had at the time&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- Magma Bird &#40;<A HREF="mailto:flashrun@altavista.com">flashrun@altavista.com</A>&#41;, March 28, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Cool! It is just one of those things I&#39;ve never done. I&#39;m always nice to my monsters and try to raise them well, but I was just trying stuff out and testing for &#34;resistance&#34; and got to &#34;spartan&#34; raising style. I guess I&#39;m being kind of mean to my poor little monster.  <BR> <BR>-- The Man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:djedmond@pinenet.com">djedmond@pinenet.com</A>&#41;, March 28, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>well when i first got the game i was at spartan and my monster ran away for the longest i think 5 months.in ever rested him he was always stressed.don&#39;t call me sick but then i enjoyed to see my mocchi suffer.  <BR> <BR>-- geric a. &#40;<A HREF="mailto:gmlba@compass.com.ph">gmlba@compass.com.ph</A>&#41;, March 28, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>I put a monster though H&#42;&#42;&#42; trying to get that resistance to take place, I have yet to see it.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 28, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>i once killed a mocchi in 3 months  <BR> <BR>-- RaPtOr2157 &#40;<A HREF="mailto:raptor2157@aol.com">raptor2157@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 29, 2000.  <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve had Taurancy before but skipped the animation so I don&#39;t know what it does.

He did Truancy virtually every drill. It&#39;s really funny, especially in the &#34;Pull&#34; exercise. It looked like he was attacking Joy! I still laugh when I think about it. I treated him like hell and he still lived for 3 years. I never let him rest, always put him in the hard drills, sent him on errantries, did whatever I could to kill him off. Fed him potatoes. He was stressed to the max. And he still lived for 3 years.

To kill a monster quickly avoid feeding it, keep it stressed and tired and fight it in those free-for- all tournaments.  <BR> <BR>-- The Man &#40;djedmond@@pinenet.com&#41;, March 29, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>If you dont have mr1 like me and dont want to have to spend an eternity for a monster to die to get monsters like mocks,wrackys try a Dragon .Get a newborn and train it on hard drills&#40;or for better results try tournaments get it K.O&#41; for 1&#40;or 2&#41;months with no rest if you have money give it a few stimulants and enter it in a free for all tournament.I tried this and it lived for 2 months and gave up after its one and only tournament.I dont consider this a waste since I prefer monsters who are worth raising I could just get another one from the invitational on Auguast 2nd.  <BR> <BR>-- Rion Beyolve &#40;<A HREF="mailto:twopaclives@hotmail.com">twopaclives@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, March 29, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>I know that I&#39;ve stated this before, but my Dad &#40;as unusual a style as he has&#41; raised a Gaia for Mock fertilizer &#40;to get the Mock&#41; on &#34;Spartan.&#34; The worst part is that he sent it on two errantries, it was never rested, always stressed, always tired, and it STILL LIVED FOR 6 UNBELIEVABLE YEARS!!! If I hadn&#39;t observed this, I would NEVER have believed him &#40;even though he rarely lies&#41;!  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, March 31, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Thats messed up.
