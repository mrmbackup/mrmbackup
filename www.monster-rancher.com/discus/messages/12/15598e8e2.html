 Okay so I began to experiment with Gaboo on heavy errantry, I saved before I went, I got &#39;Back Blow&#39;... typical. Reset and tried again, I got &#39;Straight&#39; this time!! So I know for a fact Gaboo can learn &#39;Straight&#39; first, but this was only an experiment, so I got my &#34;real&#34; Gaboo and sent him on errantry and I cannot teach him &#39;Straight&#39; for the life of him, he is constantly learning &#39;Back Blow&#39;, I must of reset 100 times, I just can&#39;t get it to work, what the hell is going on?! My Gaboo is 1 yr 5 mo old. His stats are - Lif 268, Pow 205, Int 34, Ski 70, Spd 200, Def 68. He is normal, not fat or skinny. His style is soft at the moment. He has no other techs learnt so far. What am I doing wrong? <BR> <BR>The experimental Gaboo was fresh from the market, 0 yr 0 mo old. I let him rest one week, then sent him on errantry, like I said, he learnt &#39;Back Blow&#39; first time so I reset and the second time he learnt &#39;Straight&#39;, I cannot recreate this with my current gaboo :&#40; <BR> <BR>Please help.

 Have you tried going in another week? Sometimes events seem to be tied to a particular week, as in not randomized properly, and they can work in a different week. &#40;the week had visible effects in MR1&#41;

 I tried it on different weeks, different months, even years and different stages of my Gaboo&#39;s life. I just do not understand why the baby Gaboo was able to learn &#39;Straight&#39; before &#39;Back Blow&#39; after the first reset. Yet my trained Gaboo cannot learn it before &#39;Back Blow&#39; after 50 resets. &#40;I counted&#41; On different weeks, months and years. Could someone do some research and try to figure this out? <BR> <BR>Also, in the D rank tournaments, Sakura Art has &#39;Roll Attack&#39; but I can only learn that after I have learnt &#39;Petal Swirl&#39; but Sakura Art doesn&#39;t have &#39;Petal Swirl&#39;, it&#39;s as if I have to learn certain moves first to unlock the next one.

 The tourney monsters are unique and several have abilities that aren&#39;t possible for players to have. <BR> <BR>As for the research, it&#39;s up to everyone to do their own here. That&#39;s essentially what this site is all about.

 I see, I&#39;m not going to make another discussion so I&#39;m just gonna post my questions here. <BR>  <BR>1. Why do some people combine their monsters in their &#39;Prime&#39;? Does it make any difference? <BR> <BR>2. Is it okay to combine two monsters that are the same, for example, I have two really well trained Mocchi/Mochhi, would I still get a high stat baby from combining two of the same monsters?

 1. Yes, it makes a large difference. This allows stats and techs to transfer at the best possible rate. <BR> <BR>2. Yes and No. Stats will be higher than untrained monsters but combining two of the same monster seems to force it back towards the baseline stats for the breed. Better to find another compatible monster to combine with.

 Thanks for the reply, I understand better now. <BR> <BR>One more question. <BR> <BR>Me and my brother want to recreate the tourney opponents for 2p player battle so right now I am making Lontar, as you know Lontar has the &#39;Lick&#39; tech, but sending him on errantry would make his Life higher than 121, Green Suezo base Life is 120, so I thought what if I got a market Suezo, taught it &#39;Lick&#39; and then combined it with Plant so the outcome would be a Green Suezo starting with the &#39;Lick&#39; tech, then I would train him in swimming and hope that his Life would only increase by 1 as he will have &#39;baby gains&#39; nothing else really matters when it comes to fine numbers other than Life as you all know. &#40;All stats other than Life only matter in the 50&#39;s&#41;  <BR> <BR>However when I combined the two, the baby Green Suezo did not have the &#39;Lick&#39; tech so I reset, this time I got Plant from the combination, but Plant started with &#39;Toxic Nectar&#39;. I have reset quite a few times now, if I get Suezo or Green Suezo, it never has the withering tech carried over, but whenever I get Plant or Plant/Suezo &#40;Can&#39;t remember it&#39;s name&#41; they always have the withering tech carried over? Why is this? Any suggestions/help?

 It is an INT based tech so the only thing I can think of is that the baby has insufficient INT. Tourney opponents often have techs that are hard &#40;or impossible&#41; for trainers to get in their class range. <BR> <BR>Techs carry over in a random fashion based on the stats for each monster.

 Solved it. Instead of teaching a market Suezo the withering tech, I taught the Plant the withering tech and combined it with a market Suezo using Plant as the 1st monster, this time the opposite happened, if I got Green Suezo or Suezo, it had the withering tech, where as if I got Plant or Plant/Suezo it did not. When combining does the result have to be the main of the 2nd monster for the techs to carry over properly? That&#39;s what it seems like here? I&#39;m confused.
