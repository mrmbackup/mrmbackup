After a series of experiments, I have come to a conclusion about the effects of Troron. The effect of Troron is this: For every successful drill, a monster under the effect of Troron gains 10 points to power and 5 points to skillin addition to the normal stat gains. There is no additional effect for heavy drills. The effects of Troron last for 1 month. NOTE: The game will not notify you of the additional stat gains. You must look at the monster&#39;s stats following the drill to see the effect.  <BR> <BR>Does Troron reduce lifespan? Unfortunately, yes. Some experiments with a newborn Gali on a couple of saved games demonstrated this effect.  <BR> <BR><B>Subject:</B> Gali &#40;Gali/Gali&#41;  <BR> <BR><B>Hold for Effect items held:</B> 1 Sculpture.  <BR> <BR><B>Regimen:</B> Light drill, Light Drill, Light Drill, Rest &#40;none, Mint Leaf, none, none&#41;  <BR> <BR>I fed him Tablets every month &#40;he liked them BTW&#41;. I did not scold him for failure or cheating.  <BR> <BR>The Control subject was not given Troron the first week and was raised under this regimen. The Experimental Subject was given Troron the first week of life and raised under this regimen. The objective was to observe how many weeks it takes for the subjects to reach Stage 2 &#40;See RNA&#39;s Monster Life Stages thread for details&#41;. The longer the subject takes to reach Stage 2, the longer the lifespan.  <BR> <BR><B>Results:</B>  <BR> <BR>The Control subject took 74 weeks to reach Stage 2. The Experimental subject given Troron took 64 weeks to reach Stage 2.  <BR> <BR><B>Conclusion:</B> Barring effects from other items, Troron reduces 10 weeks from a monster&#39;s lifespan.  <BR> <BR>So, in conclusion, is it worth it? In my opinion, given the considerable lifespan hit, probably not. However, the decision to use it is yours. Now that you have read this, at least now its an informed decision. The effects of Troron&#39;s sister drug, Paradoxine, may be forthcoming in the future.  <BR> <BR>Some credit must be given to Farmer Jimbo for pioneering the use of these items and giving me incentive to look into them further.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 26, 1999  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Good job Dark Phoenix.  <BR> <BR>-- Zack &#40;<A HREF="mailto:belgrath16@aol.com">belgrath16@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 26, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>During stage 1:  <BR> <BR>note: brackets -&#62; &#40;, &#41;, do not imply mathematical multiplication. They simply give a note to where the number preceding it comes from.  <BR> <BR>- Using &#40;shoot,shoot,shoot,shoot&#41; &#40;NO,ML,NO,ML&#41; with a monster that gets an average of &#40;3pts&#41; on shoot drills.  <BR> <BR>In 4 weeks time&#40;with troron&#41;: You can get &#91;3pts of SKI&#40;shoot drill&#41; X 4 weeks&#93; &#43; &#91;10pts of POW&#40;troron&#41; X 4 weeks&#93; &#43; &#91;5pts of SKI&#40;troron&#41; X 4 weeks&#93; = 72pts&#40;32pts to SKI and 40pts to POW&#41;  <BR> <BR>In 14 weeks time&#40;without troron&#41;: you can get &#91;3pts of SKI&#40;shoot drill&#41; X 14&#93; = 42pts to SKI.  <BR> <BR>- Using &#40;shoot,shoot,shoot,shoot&#41; &#40;NO,ML,NO,ML&#41; with a monster that gets an average of &#40;7pts&#41; on shoot drills.  <BR> <BR>In 4 weeks time&#40;with troron&#41;: You can get &#91;7pts of SKI&#40;shoot drill&#41; X 4 weeks&#93; &#43; &#91;10pts of POW&#40;troron&#41; X 4 weeks&#93; &#43; &#91;5pts of SKI&#40;troron&#41; X 4 weeks&#93; = 88pts&#40;48pts to SKI and 40pts to POW&#41;  <BR> <BR>In 14 weeks time&#40;without troron&#41;: you can get &#91;7pts of SKI&#40;shoot drill&#41; X 14&#93; = 98pts to SKI.  <BR> <BR>From this observation, it is seen that the lower average a monster gets on a respective drill, the more gain it will get from the use of troron. However, as the the average goes higher, the use of troron becomes that of a negative effect.  <BR> <BR>Therefore, the usage of troron during stage 2 - stage 3 is inadvisable since most hard drills at that time almost always gives you a net average higher than that of 10.  <BR> <BR>So when is it good to use? Say you have a Wracky that only get 1 - 4 &#40;average = 2&#41; pts in shoot for the duration of its 1st stage&#40;4 years&#41;.  <BR> <BR>If you simply train for these 4 years, you&#39;ll get &#91;2pts of SKI &#40;average&#41; X 48 weeks&#40;in 1 year&#41; X 4 years&#93; = 384 SKI.  <BR> <BR>If you use troron every month, you&#39;ll have only 52 weeks to train plus an addtional remainder of 10 weeks training without the effects of troron. So, that will get you &#91;2pts of SKI&#40;average&#41; X 52 weeks &#40;duration of troron&#41;&#93; &#43; &#91;10pts of POW&#40;troron&#41; X 52 weeks&#40;duration of troron&#41;&#93; &#43; &#91;5pts of SKI X 52 weeks&#40;duration of troron&#41;} &#43; &#91;2pts of SKI &#40;average&#41; X 10 weeks&#40;remainder period without troron&#41;&#93; = 104 SKI &#43; 520 POW &#43; 260 SKI &#43; 20 SKI = 384 SKI and an additional 520 POW!!!  <BR> <BR>Isn&#39;t a wracky bad at POW? Well, you can solve that with the usage of troron&#40;as seen above&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Remember, the effects only work really well when your average stat gaining in a particular drill is low &#40;as seen in a wracky&#41;. In the above example, the wracky got an additional 520 pts from the usage of troron in stage 1.  <BR> <BR>I would like to see how paradoxine also benefits from this. In addition to normal stat gains, you gain 30 pts to POW and SKI, but you also lose 10pts to SPD and DEF. Basically, it is 4 times more powerful than troron. However, we do not know how much lifespan decrese it gets. Even if it takes off 20 weeks, it is still alot more useful than troron. &#40;info taken from &#34;This is what Paradoxine and Toron do to your monster&#34; by farmer jimbo&#41;  <BR> <BR>do you want to test this out as well, dark phoenix?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, December 26, 1999.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>More examples: # = average gains on a drill.  <BR> <BR>In 4 weeks time&#40;with troron&#41;: You can get &#91;# of pts&#40;average in drill&#41; X 4 weeks&#93; &#43; &#91;10pts of POW&#40;troron&#41; X 4 weeks&#93; &#43; &#91;5pts of SKI&#40;troron&#41; X 4 weeks&#93; = answer  <BR> <BR>In 14 weeks time&#40;without troron&#41;: you can get &#91;# of pts&#40;average in drill&#41; X 14&#93; = answer  <BR> <BR>With # = 1: Troron = 64pts, No Troron = 14pts.  <BR> <BR>With # = 2: Troron = 68pts, No Troron = 28pts.  <BR> <BR>With # = 3: Troron = 72pts, No Troron = 42pts.  <BR> <BR>With # = 4: Troron = 76pts, No Troron = 56pts.  <BR> <BR>With # = 5: Troron = 80pts, No Troron = 70pts.  <BR> <BR>With # = 6: Troron = 84pts, No Troron = 84pts.  <BR> <BR>With # = 7: Troron = 88pts, No Troron = 98pts.  <BR> <BR>With # = 8: Troron = 92pts, No Troron = 112pts.  <BR> <BR>so, the effects of troron usage and not using troron intersect at # = 6. So if your average in drills is 6, then using/notUsing troron has the same effect on stat gains. However, by using troron, you lose lifespan for no reason which will possibly prevent you from getting silver peaches&#40;the only negative effect when # = 6&#41;.  <BR> <BR>From these results, it would only be advisable to use troron when your average gains from drills is 5&#40;maybe 4&#41; or less. Anything else, would not even be worth the trouble.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, December 26, 1999.
