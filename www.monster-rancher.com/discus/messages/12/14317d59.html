 Ok does a 2nd gen. monster mean that it was combined by two raised monsters only and not by just any two non-raised monsters?  Because I&#39;m using my Leziena which was gotten from my orignial Durahan &#40;which came from two non-raised monsters&#41; and a non-rasied jilt&#40;which came from original wracky&#41;.  In other words if you combine two non-raised monsters, does the result still count as a 2nd gen?  Or is it only 2nd gen if you do it with two fully raised monsters?

 In the case of the creature you&#39;er mentioning, I&#39;d actually call it a third generation monster, since your Jilt and Durahan were both second generation. Even if the monsters weren&#39;t raised, as soon as you make a &#39;breeding&#39;, I tend to call it a generation. However, when I use the term, I&#39;m usually talking about raised creatures being put together. Still, if yuo have a newborn pixie and a nweborn jell and combine them, yuo have a newborn, 2nd generation, pixie/jell &#40;or jell/pixie, or whatever&#41;, by my calculations. <BR> <BR>Of course, this depends strongly on hte person as well.

 2nd gen. monsters can be raised or unraised.  <BR>2nd gen. stats and attacks at least one must be raised.

 there are two, exactly opposite, views on this definitional question. <BR> <BR>everyone agrees that a monster right off the disc is a first gen. everyone agrees that a first gen combined with a first gen makes a second gen. <BR> <BR>the different view are in answer to this question:  what is it if you combine a second gen with a first gen? <BR> <BR>View a:  a monster is the lowest number gen &#43;1.  the resulting monster is a second gen. <BR> <BR>View b:  a monster is the highest number gen &#43;1.  the resulting monster is a third gen.

This is the way I decide Gens on my monsters... It&#39;s not iron clad by any means, but around here, with all those I game with, we&#39;ve adopted this method of determining generation... It&#39;s more convoluted to look at than to use. <BR> <BR>A first Gen monster is one of the following: <BR> <BR>1&#41; straight off of a CD <BR>2&#41; straight from the market <BR>3&#41; what you get when crossbreeding 2 monsters and using an item to make a completely new  <BR>breed &#40;i.e. Fake Penguin &#43; Evil Hare &#43; Fire Feather = 1st Gen Phoenix&#41; <BR>4&#41; Bred completely by subbreeds &#40;see below&#41; <BR> <BR>Other than that, gen is decided by the Primary Breed Parent &#40;Pixie/Kato &#43; Gali/Monol = Pixie/Gali, where Pixie is the Primary Breed Parent &#91;PBP&#93;&#41;.  Examples: <BR> <BR>1&#41;  4th Gen Angel &#43; 2nd Gen Mock = 5th Gen Dryad <BR>2&#41;  1st Gen Mew &#43; 3rd Gen Scaled Hare = 2nd Gen Eared Mew <BR> <BR>The oddball here is if both subbreeds come through.  The monster is considered 1st Gen at that point &#40;various reasons... one being that if you got subbreeds only for the result, your numbers seem more subdued, at least that&#39;s our experience... that and it&#39;s neither a Suezo or a Zuum, despite the fact that&#39; who its parents were&#41;.  In other words: <BR> <BR>1&#41; 3rd Gen Evil Hare &#43; 5th Gen Striker = 1st Gen Asphaltum <BR>2&#41; 8th Gen Granity &#43; 1st Gen Rock Hound = 1st Gen Golem <BR> <BR>That&#39;s how we do it Eugene style... : &#41; <BR> <BR>PezCat <BR> <BR>

 Just like to say that everyone here really knows what there talking about, thanks for all the info. <BR> <BR>What would u call a monster that is 2nd Gen &#40;Naga/Naga - trained&#41;, combined with a 1st gen &#40;Monol/Zuum - not trained&#41;.  Then the offspring &#40;Naga/Monol - trained&#41; is combined with another 1st gen &#40;Jell/Jell -not trained&#41;. and so on and so on.  Would the Gen go up everytime the trained monster is combined with a 1st Gen?  <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>P.S. I kept the main breed Naga, Named him Mavala, i&#39;ve combined him 4 times

that&#39;s one definition, the more lenient definition.  others take a more hard-line view, definitionally, and would say that a monster&#39;s gen is only 1&#43; the gen of the <I>youngest</I> monster in the combo.

 In truth, I tend to do something right in between the two. I average out the generation of the two monsters, thus averaging out what sort of gains I&#39;m looking at. Thus, if I end up breeding a level 4 and a level 1, I don&#39;t end up calling it a level 5 &#40;because there&#39;s no way it could have as good of stats as a true lev. 5&#41; or a level 2 &#40;because it should be better than just a 2&#41;. Thus, it&#39;ll end up the equivilent of a 3rd generation. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a rough way to do it, not quite scientific, but it ends up working for me.

 When I mention the generation of the monster, I use the highest generation of the breeding pair and add 1. <BR> <BR>The only exception is when I use a pair of untrained monsters to get a third. Then, the resulting offspring is a first generation monster. <BR> <BR>Varthlokkur

 In My Opinion, a 2nd generation monster is to have 2 trained 1st generation monsters combined. <BR> <BR>This leaves you with a 2nd generation monster. <BR>For me, a true 3rd generation monster would require 4 1st generation monsters &#40;2X2 combined = 2 2nd gen monsters&#41; <BR>Then raise BOTH of the 2nd gen monsters for another combination which would result in the 3rd generation monster. <BR> <BR>If you are combining a 2nd gen monster with a 1st gen untrained newborn, you COULD be wasting valuable stat scores, or possibly a nice move selection as well.

 i always determine gens as the highest gen plus one as long as the monster has the same main breed as one of the monsters going in. so when i combined my traind hare/jell &#40;2nd gen&#41; with a half trained ape/golem 1st gen and it became a golem/hare it is a first gen golem. but if i breed a my 2nd gen undine/siren with a &#92;3rd gen pixie/mock and it becomes a pixie pixie it would be a 4th gen since the pixie in the combo was a 3rd genner

 just so you know i  have not tried the second combo yet but barring resseting and my experience with undine combining &#40;no matter what the percentage undine mains just don&#39;t like to come out without numerous resets&#41; i am guessing that is what would happen at least a quarter of the time

 My definition of generation &#40;everyone has one so why shouldn&#39;t I?&#41; 1st generation is off slate, disk, market, and explained below. <BR> <BR>1st gen &#40;untrained&#41; &#43; 1st gen &#40;untrained&#41;= 1st gen <BR>Any gen &#40;untrained&#41; &#43; Any gen &#40;untrained&#41;= 1st gen or second gen if starts off with more than basic moves. <BR>1st gen &#40;trained&#41; &#43; 1st gen &#40;trained&#41;= 2nd gen <BR>2nd gen &#40;trained&#41; &#43; 1st gen &#40;trained&#41;= 3rd gen <BR>2nd gen &#40;trained&#41; &#43; 2nd gen &#40;trained&#41;= 3rd gen <BR>Basically any generation combined with any generation as long as it is trained will bring it up to the next generations so a 3rd &#43; 5th would equal a 6th generation. <BR>Any gen &#40;untrained&#41; &#43; Any gen &#40;trained&#41;= 2nd or 3rd gen.   <BR>This is true because the stats will be higher but they will not be as high as if the second monster was trained and almost definately won&#39;t be the strength of a 4th or higher generation.  Even if the strength levels out after a while.
