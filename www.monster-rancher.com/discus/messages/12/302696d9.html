 the name is Snake, it makes the game a little hard, as i know now, i got a gaboo soldier, in one of my files it got a high stat at the 6 years 7 months, but in the Snake file the gaboo soldier wasn´t so great, i made same all when i signed as a new trainer, i had to load many times to get the same questions, and put the names of Carlos in one file and Snake in other file, both started to raise a gaboo soldier, same training, same food, same all, but the gain wasn´t same, the gaboo of Carlos file had a gain of 10 points of lif per drill, and in the Snake file of 5 points per drill, the failure random of the gaboo in carlos was of 1/20 or 1/30, and in Snake was of 1/3 or 1/4, that was in  my game, sometimes it varies, with other monsters it is of 1/7 or sometimes it is the same, i gona get another names to see what happen, if this is the only name that make a little hard the game or there are some others, because i think that if there are names that make hard the game, there must be too to make easy the game...

 we discussed this in chat over the last week.  i never heard of anything like this.  it sounds unlikely to me, but i have to admit that i know of nothing that says it &#42;must&#42; be untrue.  anyone?

With so many variables, starting with the random selection of likes and dislikes every time you use a CD &#40;and believe me there&#39;s a huge difference between monsters who dislike tablets and ones that like them!&#41;, it&#39;s difficult if not impossible to test something like this. You mentioned in chat that you raised one of these monsters, and your friend raised the other. You did not say whether or not you kept resetting the game until the shrined monsters liked and disliked the same things as his. No mention was made of what inventory items you or he have in each file. Remember, Lump Of Ice, Fire Stone, Hero/Heel Badges etc. affect monsters. So do the choices of drills and errantries. Unless you personally raised each one, and wrote down what you did each week, then duplicated it week by on the other file, you can&#39;t really compare. I also suspect you are giving too much weight to your memory of raising these monsters. After all, you stated in chat that one was getting 20&#43; on drills before it was 1 year of age. <BR> <BR>I also find it hard to believe, after all the research Dark Phoenix, Nevistar, and Richard Ryley have done on the game &#40;looking at the game&#39;s programming code line by line&#41; that no one ever found a set of options making each drill/battle/errantry harder or easier to do. Seems like those options would be present throughout the game, not just in the initial setting, seeing as MR is not a story-based game, but a free-form sim. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t say definitively, either, and input from DP, Nevistar, or Richard would be appreciated, but I can state that this is the sort of cheat that is highly unlikely in a game of this sort, particularly given the size of the program and how much of the code has been examined.

 ... no, i never got 20 points more before the three years, i got 10 before the year, but only for lif... whatever... my friend told me that he researched on the game shark codes and he never found anything of the game to be easy or hard, and neither you find that option in normal circumstances as you know, my friend raised another, i raised two, one in Carlos, and other in Snake, and in that files i tried to get the same likes and dislikes, by the way, i got the name Charles and the game is normal, isn´t easy or hard, and the failure random is of 1/10...

 whatever... i got a different gaboo today, different likes and dislikes, in the file of Carlos, and the strange thing is that he failed 4 times in two months, once succes, once cheat, and i let him rest two times

well, here is the first small sample.  i started a new game three times - once as Torey, once as Tecmo and once as Snake.  Each trainer raised the mr2 mocchi - Torey raised torey; Tecmo raised tecmo and Snake raised snake. <BR> <BR>the monsters did not have identical likes and dislkies, however, none of their likes and dislikes came into play directly during the raising period: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>monster</TD><TD>like</TD><TD>dislike </TD></TR><TR><TD>torey</TD><TD>potato</TD><TD>battle </TD></TR><TR><TD>tecmo</TD><TD>rice cracker</TD><TD>tablet </TD></TR><TR><TD>snake</TD><TD>parepare tea</TD><TD>tablet</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>Each trainer answered the 10 questions in a yes/no alternate pattern.  Each trainer fed his monster milk until it no longer liked it anymore, then the food was changed to fish.  cheating was always scolded.  failure was not scolded/scolded in an alternating fashion, until the spoil warning was given by colt; thereafter, all failure was scolded until the spoil warning was no longer given.  greats were always praised.  mint leaves were given when a stress warning was received; otherwise, no other items were given.  the monsters never fought in a battle. <BR> <BR>training was done as follows: ld, ld, ld, rest.  the drill chosen rotated among the 6 lds over a two month period.  months 1,3,5,7,9 and 11 saw the monster train in domino, study and run; months 2,4,6,8,10 and 12 were shoot, dodge and endure. <BR> <BR>after a year of being raised in this fashion, here are the results: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>monster</TD><TD>lif</TD><TD>pow</TD><TD>int</TD><TD>ski</TD><TD>spd</TD><TD>def</TD><TD>gain </TD></TR><TR><TD>original</TD><TD>110</TD><TD>100</TD><TD>120</TD><TD>140</TD><TD>150</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>- </TD></TR><TR><TD>torey</TD><TD>128</TD><TD>117</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>170</TD><TD>171</TD><TD>153</TD><TD>&#43;119 </TD></TR><TR><TD>tecmo</TD><TD>122</TD><TD>115</TD><TD>133</TD><TD>168</TD><TD>173</TD><TD>159</TD><TD>&#43;120 </TD></TR><TR><TD>snake</TD><TD>123</TD><TD>111</TD><TD>133</TD><TD>165</TD><TD>175</TD><TD>149</TD><TD>&#43;106</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>here are some more results: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>monster</TD><TD>fail</TD><TD>cheat</TD><TD>great </TD></TR><TR><TD>torey</TD><TD>7</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>3 </TD></TR><TR><TD>tecmo</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>3 </TD></TR><TR><TD>snake</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>1</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>torey and tecmo performed nearly equally, despite the fact that the raising pattern resulted in torey no longer liking milk one month sooner than tecmo or snake.  snake did 13-14 pts worse, had more 1-2 more failures and 2 less greats. <BR> <BR>this result could have been achieved by normal randomness.  this test takes about 1 1/2 hours to run, primarily because i write down the week-by-week results.  i will repeat the test when i get an 1 1/2 hour free period.

here is the second test results.  same raising parameters.  this time, i used the market zuum. <BR> <BR>again, although they had different likes and dislikes, none of them came into play during their year of being raised. <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>monster</TD><TD>like</TD><TD>dislike </TD></TR><TR><TD>torey</TD><TD>tablet</TD><TD>potato </TD></TR><TR><TD>tecmo</TD><TD>nuts oil</TD><TD>potato </TD></TR><TR><TD>snake</TD><TD>battle</TD><TD>cup jelly</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>here are the final stats: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>monster</TD><TD>lif</TD><TD>pow</TD><TD>int</TD><TD>ski</TD><TD>spd</TD><TD>def</TD><TD>gain </TD></TR><TR><TD>original</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>120</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>140</TD><TD>100</TD><TD>110</TD><TD>  -   </TD></TR><TR><TD>torey</TD><TD>167</TD><TD>133</TD><TD>101</TD><TD>159</TD><TD>113</TD><TD>123</TD><TD>&#43;116 </TD></TR><TR><TD>tecmo</TD><TD>145</TD><TD>131</TD><TD>88</TD><TD>161</TD><TD>127</TD><TD>131</TD><TD>&#43;103 </TD></TR><TR><TD>snake</TD><TD>153</TD><TD>138</TD><TD>93</TD><TD>163</TD><TD>117</TD><TD>135</TD><TD>&#43;119</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>and here is their other info: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>monster</TD><TD>fail</TD><TD>cheat</TD><TD>great </TD></TR><TR><TD>torey</TD><TD>4</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>3 </TD></TR><TR><TD>tecmo</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>snake</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>2</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>torey kicked a$$ - theres no other way to say it.  although snake outgained him by 3 points composite, that is entirely due to the fact that snake failed and cheated so much in the first four months that enough stress built up that he stopped liking milk a month before torey. &#91;and two months before tecmo&#93;.  this led to snake having more stage 2 time during the year, which led to him gaining more points at the end of the year.   <BR> <BR>snake again failed and cheated more than the others.  however, my feeling as i was raising him &#91;which is something different than an objective conclusion&#93; is that the arbitrary rules of raising that i adopted beforehand had more to do with this than the name.  if i had taken snake to task, gotten him to strict, given him mint leaves every month, i feel he would have been a more succesful worker. <BR> <BR>in any event, i am just about done with this theory.  if there really was a built-in handicap for the name snake, it would most likely always occur and it would be more pronounced than the test results above.  i may do this again with a bad natured monster off a disc, like a pixie, just to see if that makes any difference.
