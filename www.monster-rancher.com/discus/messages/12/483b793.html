This thread will be filed under Breeding for those of you who want to follow it after it rolls off the bottom.  <BR> <BR><B>Main goals:</B>  <BR> <BR>Raise a second generation Mocky &#40;Wracky/Mock&#41; from my first generation Wracky and Mock. Experiment with breeding in a controlled atmosphere. Raise a hall of legends monster. Use Paradoxine to create a 4000&#43; point monster. Breed a monster that can handle the lifespan effects of 5&#43; doses of Paradoxine. Test anecdotal methods I learned from this and other Monster Rancher resources.  <BR> <BR><B>Part 1 :</B> Final stats of breeding stock and initial breeding results  <BR> <BR><B>Part 2 :</B> Final breeding results and initial training report  <BR> <BR><B>Part 3 :</B> Final results of second gen monster  <BR> <BR><B>Appendix :</B> How Charles &#40;Wracky&#41; and Gonzalez &#40;Mock&#41; were raised. I have lots of notes on this but it’ll take a while to compile.  <BR> <BR><B>Part 1 :</B> So far my Monster Rancher 2 playing time has been consumed in a mad dash to unlock all the monster breeds. I have been intrigued by the principles of breeding, but haven’t spent the time to do so in a controlled manner. Once I achieved ninth rank and unlocked all the breeds, the time seemed right for a breeding project. My Mock Gonzalez was almost five years old and I had a brand new Wracky just itching to be raised. For those of you who followed the Paradoxine threads, I reloaded my game to the point just after I found my first vial of Paradoxine.  <BR> <BR>I’ll detail the raising methods and year by year results in the appendix thread. The final stats before breeding are : Monster 1 – Wracky 6 years 10 months old – LIF 456 – POW 360 – INT 999 – SKI 407 – SPD – 207 – DEF 114 ; Even raising – Normal weight – Neutral alignment – Likes &#40;me&#41; – Dislikes Tablet ; A Class ; 94 Loyalty ; Very Well ; Knows 16 different attacks!  <BR> <BR>Monster 2 – Mock 7 years 5 months old – LIF 456 – POW 357 – INT 999 – SKI 407 – SPD 207 – DEF 114 ; Even raising – Normal weight – Best alignment – Likes &#40;me&#41; – Dislikes – Meat ; A Class ; 98 Loyalty ; Very Well ; Knows 7 different attacks.  <BR> <BR><B>First breeding Set</B>, July 4th week. Combined Wracky as main and Mock as sub type. Used Ghost chips to add &#43;1 symbol on dodge drills. Dadge says “The prospect here is unsure”. 67 % Mocky, 28 % Wracky, 5% Mock. Combined 12 times. 7 Wrackys, 5 Mockys, no Mocks. Typical Wracky stats : LIF 53 – POW 39 – INT 226 – SKI 72 – SPD 167 – DEF 46 ; Even raising – Normal weight – Neutral alignment – Likes Potato – Dislikes Milk ; Knows 9 attacks. DEF fluctuates between 48 and 44, all other stats stay the same. Raising, weight and alignment stay the same but likes and dislikes run the gamut. Typical Mocky stats : LIF 82 – POW 69 – INT 269 – SKI 61 – SPD 124 – DEF 34 ; Even – Normal – Neutral – Razor Blade – Meat ; Knows 9 attacks. INT fluctuates between 255 and 282, all other stats stay the same. Again, only likes and dislikes change from combo to combo.  <BR> <BR><B>Second Breeding Set</B>, September 4th week. 5 Wrackys, 7 Mockys, no Mocks. Same results for stats except one Wracky and one Mocky started with ten attacks instead of nine.  <BR> <BR><B>Third Breeding Set</B>, November 4th week. 3 Wrackys, 9 Mockys, no Mocks. Again, same small fluctuations in DEF or INT. Favorite Mocky found on 33rd combo try. 282 INT, likes Whet Stone, dislikes Meat, 10 attacks, happy about Milk, tolerates Tablets.  <BR> <BR><B>Fourth Breeding set</B>, January 4th week. 4 Wrackys, 8 Mockys, no Mocks. Another breeding set with predictable results. Two Mockys had 10 attacks instead of 9.  <BR> <BR><B>Fifth Breeding set</B>, March 4th week. STOP! 1 Mock : LIF 244 – POW 109 – INT 432 – SKI 93 – SPD 63 – DEF 65; Even – Normal – Neutral – Likes Meat – Dislikes Cup Jelly ; Knows 5 attacks, missing only leaf gattling, specials, and Evil Drain. Happy about milk, tolerates tablets.  <BR> <BR>I had intended to complete March’s 12 breeding combos and move onto May’s, but now I must step back and reconsider. A Mock that starts with 432 INT. WOW! 5 attacks, good likes and dislikes. So my first questions is this: Given my original conditions, should I stick with Bristle Cone, my bad ass Mocky, or should I go with Sequoia, my badder ass Mock? I still intend to complete the breeding set for a total of 72 different combinations, but I simply had to stop in my tracks and write up this post. Some interesting conclusions can be gleaned from the above data, but I’ll save that for later. I want to get this post out and get some reaction. I’ll have the rest of the breeding results and MY conclusions tomorrow afternoon EST.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, January 10, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Interesting. I have had very similar results to yours. I never kept as much track of it as you did. Pretty amazing. Just wondering though did it change from unsure to great when you finally got the last combitnation or not?  <BR> <BR>-- The Man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:djedmond@pinenet.com">djedmond@pinenet.com</A>&#41;, January 10, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>That seems really interesting, if you havn&#39;t you should save that game to a different file and then continue your experiment so you can go back if it proves fruitless.

From your example, it seems as though this doesn&#39;t happen. I&#39;ve never done anything like combining with my monsters at different dates so I wouldn&#39;t know.  <BR> <BR>Hmmm..... a &#40;Wracky/Mock&#41;. Both the Wracky main and the Moch subbreed have the longest lifespans in the game. A &#40;mock/mock&#41; also has a huge lifespan&#40;not too sure how long&#41; as well. However, your mock has better starting stats so I would have to suggest you stick with the mock.  <BR> <BR>A purebreed wracky can handle up to 9 paradoxines before leaving its 1st stage. I wonder how many a mock can hold out for.....  <BR> <BR>Keep posting those upcoming parts, I&#39;m interested to see where you&#39;re going with this.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Some quick answers to the above posts. Yes I have a number of saves I&#39;ll hang onto to test some other factors in breeding. Dadge has never wavered in his opinion of the combination. The purpose of trying different dates for combining is two-fold. Does the date effect stats? Apparently no. Does the date effect the chance of getting one of the possible monster types? Apparently yes. I’m supposed to be working so I’ll have to cut this short for now.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, January 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Ok as promised, here’s some more info. The March 4th week breeding set : 5 Wrackys, 7 Mockys, no Mocks. Yes I discarded the mock as a statistical aberration. I did not get around to the “final” May 4th breeding set last night. Once again, my real job kept me late at the office and for some reason they won’t let me play Monster rancher on company time.  <BR> <BR>Once I have my baseline data together, I intend to try this combination on all 48 weeks of the Monster Rancher year at least once or twice. I suppose for a truly inclusive data set I should run 12 combinations on every 4th week of the MR2 year, but I’m not sure I can make myself do that.  <BR> <BR>For those of you who wonder where this is going or what I’m trying to figure out, I’m not sure. This is a very open ended project for me. My main goals are listed at the top, and I intend to achieve them. But in the end, I’m just trying to figure things out and confirm theory’s I’ve read on this board. For instance, I was under the assumption that Dadge would change his opinion of a combination as the stats of the two monsters became closer and closer. Gonzalez and Charles have stats that are off by a total of three points and Dadge still claims the prospect is unsure. I also assumed that if you reloaded enough times, you’d occasionally get spectacular results. This also seems unlikely. The 432 INT mock I got does not count since it’s probably got the same stats as every pure mock that would come out of this combination. I’m interested in how attacks transfer from the parent to the child. If I reverse the combo and use my Mock as the main monster type, the resulting Mocky starts with only 5 techniques. The stats also suffer a bit, 4 less LIF, 1 less POW, unknown INT &#40;it fluctuates too much&#41;, same SKI, 2 more SPD, same DEF. But why should they be any different? Does the number of attacks a monster has contribute to the resulting monster’s stats, or am I missing something? In a way, I’m a little embarrassed. I had wanted to do more work before I started posting my results. But when I saw a Mock with 432 INT pop out, I just couldn’t resist.  <BR> <BR>Any way, I’ve recorded the stats, likes and dislikes, and all the resulting attacks that all 60 of my combinations started off with. I’ll try to post them with the remaining 12 I’ll record tonight in a format that’s reasonably compact. I’m under no illusion that I can figure everything out myself. If I can put enough of the data out in the open, someone else might notice something I’ve missed.  <BR> <BR>Till next I post again...  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, January 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>All 48 weeks of the year? That might take a while, but if you&#39;re up to it, then by all means. That should &#34;definitely&#34; give some solid evidence of stat fluctuations while combining at different times of the year.  <BR> <BR>It is also interesting to note that the percentage system for your combining results stayed quite consistent with the cpu&#39;s calculations. The results seemed to stay at the 67% Mocky, 28% Wracky at quite a parallel manner. However, your 5% Mock was not seen as often as it should.  <BR> <BR>Maybe this evidence will prove some usefulness in validating the results of the MR2&#39;s random number generator.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 11, 2000.

 One problem that may be troublesome is the fact that the percentages given for the combination results, in my experience have no more basis in reality that the &#34;to hit&#34; percentages in battle.  I have tried many times to get a monster breed that showed 41% chance, and it took me at least a dozen times to get it, whereas the 50% breed result was actually more like 90% after about 25 tries.  Just some input, has anyone else experienced similar problems?

 Actually, this is a topic that I am looking for. There was a post on B&#39;s board that had a discussion on MR2&#39;s random number generator. Many people believed that the cpu was &#34;cheating&#34; fairly often.  <BR> <BR>A random number generator is never truly random, but it is very close in trying to produce a random number. Maybe the programmers did a crappy job at putting together a generator?
