<CENTER><B>This post is an archived thread from our other location.  <BR>Much of the info in it is out of date.  <BR>We retain it in honor of Eagle Fierce who did some of the earliest research into the game, and organised teams of researchers.  <BR>This was before anyone had hacked into the inner workings of the game, so exact values were not known at the time.</B></CENTER> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR> <BR>Hey, Eagle Fierce. I noticed in another post that your Pixies tend to be very long lived, about twice as long as most other peoples pixies, what&#39;s your secret?  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 19, 2000  <BR> <BR>Umm.. Here&#39;s my theory... The programers purposely gave Pixies long life spans. In battle when they get hurt they get hurt &#40;umm.. they don&#39;t train well in defence&#41; and this cuts down on their life span more than normal. They are also worn and stressed out easier than other monsters and that reduces it&#39;s life span. My Pixie Terra &#91;A Mia&#40; a Pixie/???&#41;&#93; is 7yr 1mo and still isn&#39;t all the way down from it&#39;s peak. The reason that I think that it lived so long is that it fought in 12 battles in its entire life. 5 to get from E to S rank &#40;slowly&#41; meanwhile never getting hit &#40;maybe once or twice&#41;. 4 to win the big four, 1 to win the Elders Cup, 1 to win the Legends Cup, and one in the middle because I needed to use an attack more to get the next one &#40;Using Bolt to get lightning&#41;. That&#39;s the only reason I can think of. Weather or not the battle thing was right or if the programmers just wanted to give them long lifespans just because I don&#39;t know.  <BR> <BR>-- Anthius &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Anthius_2@yahoo.com">Anthius_2@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, January 19, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>You know what I think it is?  <BR> <BR>When people look at a Pixie, they think that it should remain in a &#34;skinny&#34; form because it suits them. I have done so with all of my pixies so far and none of them have lived past 6 years and a bit.  <BR> <BR>I am willing to bet that most pixie trainers out there train their pixies by disregarding their form. They also feed them cup jellies because all pixies like cup jellies, but cup jellies make them lose weight.  <BR> <BR>After seeing recent evidence on the effects of form, I must conclude that skinniness/fatness reduces lifespan dramatically. And because most pixie trainers get their pixie skinny, this would mean a dramatic decrease in lifespan for all pixies of such pixie trainers.  <BR> <BR>I can get my pixies to live for 6yrs and a bit, I bet they could live way longer if I just kept their form &#34;normal.&#34; They&#39;d also live longer if they battled less, but I need all the battles that I can fit into my method, so that is out of the question.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 19, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>My first generation Baku lived to be 8y5m without a gold peach. It also had Life,Pow,Def. maxed out and 739 skill. Its form was skinny. So you are saying my Baku could have lived longer. Hmmmmm...I have a game saved when it is only six maybe I should reload it and make its form normal and give it a gold peach and see if it lives maybe to be like 10y5m.  <BR> <BR>-- The Man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:djedmond@pinenet.com">djedmond@pinenet.com</A>&#41;, January 19, 2000.  <BR> <BR>all right what are you guys doing to these Pixies my brother got his first gen Granity Pixie/golem to live 6 years 6 months no peachs and I got my first gen kitten Pixie/Kato to live 6 years 7 months with a silver peach the only reson that I retired her was for good breeding perposes she would have lived at least anthoer year all you have to do is make shure that they never get stress and if they do give them a mint leaf and dont train them intill they get tired it is just not good  <BR> <BR>-- Sterling Routson Thomas &#40;<A HREF="mailto:creeky@gateway.net">creeky@gateway.net</A>&#41;, January 19, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>The Pixie is one of my favorite monsters. It suits my training style best, so I tend to use many of them. Anyways, what I do is:  <BR>1.&#41; Train Pixie species three weeks out of the month in one of their best stats. Feed it a Mint Leaf and let it rest on the fourth week.  <BR> <BR><B>IMPORTANT:</B> I only use light drills on my monsters.  <BR> <BR>2.&#41; Feed Pixie &#40;as with any monster&#41; Milk for the first six months of its life.  <BR> <BR>3.&#41; Continue repeating steps 1 &amp; 2 until your Pixie reaches the age of 1yr 2mo. At this point, begin training it around the clock. Feed your Pixie Nuts Oil on weeks 1 &amp; 3 from now on, as well as Candy on week 2 &#40; this helps keep the weight up&#41;. Also, don&#39;t forget to feed your Pixie a Mint Leaf on the fourth week, reguardless.  <BR> <BR>4.&#41; From this point, train in a light drill on the first week, &#40;optional&#41; a Heavy drill that is opposite what it trained in &#40;first week&#41; on the second week. To make it live even longer, use all light drills. PS: Make sure the drill is at least acceptable for your Pixie. If it throws one of its tantrums, train in something else. On the third week, train in the same stat that was previously dropped in week 2. For the last week, leave it up to the Pixie to decide.  <BR> <BR>5.&#41; At the age of 2 years, you can begin to send your Pixie to tourney. If it is a first generation Pixie, then give it a Nuts Oil or Mint Leaf and send it to a single errantry &#40;I would, personally, suggest the skill. Bolt is a good starting technique for a Pixie species&#41;.  <BR> <BR>6.&#41; Continue to battle your way up through the ranks. Battle only in the official tourneys for maximum effect on lifespan. Do not skip any official tourneys! At the rank of S, send your Pixie on a FEW more errantries to get your favoured attacks &#40;Mine are Flame, Lightning, and/or Ray&#41;. You should have all the help you need to battle, and win, all the touneys. Make sure that your Pixie doesn&#39;t take more than 20-30 damage per tourney. More than that could greatly affect its lifespan.  <BR> <BR>7.&#41; The week before your monster dies, give it a peach &#40;Silver Peach first&#41;. Send it on errantries if you desire, or train it to get the stats up. Repeat with Golden Peach.  <BR> <BR>8.&#41; Practice! Find the breed that you are best with, and continue to unlock that breed until you get good enough for your standards. Only raise a third generation for an easy time.  <BR> <BR>By the way, I stated that my Pixie species lived at least 8 years. I said nothing about getting one to live 18 years. That&#39;s just ludicrous. I am currently trying to beat 11yrs 2mo, myself. Not with a Pixie, though. My second generation Garuda is over ten, and if I ever get a chance to play agian &#40;WAY to many essays to write&#41;, I am pretty confident that I can set the world record for its species.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:grimm@eurekanet.com">grimm@eurekanet.com</A>&#41;, January 20,2000
