 OK so first up I really want Delta Attack on my CPandora so I&#39;ve been praising all the Greats he gets. <BR> <BR>He was born naturally Bad nature I think... <BR> <BR>...and no matter how many Greats I praise, he does not even get to Neutral. <BR> <BR>Scolding cheats however get him to Neutral, but I can&#39;t really have a Cheat right now since he&#39;s at his prime... <BR> <BR>I fed it a Sour Jelly and it went to Neutral, yey! Then a few weeks later it went back to Bad even though he didn&#39;t get a single great/cheat during that duration. <BR> <BR>No battles either. <BR> <BR>What gives?

 Ok, this is where it&#39;s useful to keep a log of everything that happens every week. I know that sounds like a PITA, but, in the long run, your answer will lie within those pages. <BR> <BR>That said, it&#39;s thought that some breeds have a restricted range of nature and can never get to one end of the spectrum or another. Centaurs come to mind here.

 It&#39;s really just DP&#39;s method... that is, no battles, no errantries after prime &#40;which he is in right now&#41;, no Cheats, praise on Greats... <BR> <BR>Magic Bananas all for -10 loyalty, Nuts Oils, Tablets... <BR> <BR>...am I doing something wrong?

 Is it a pure CP? I think some sub-breeds can influence nature. &#40;eg. I raise a lot of Joker subs for the Real special and the long old age, and I almost never get one of them above neutral. Needs more research but that&#39;s just been my observation.&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, all you can do is give it jellies and keep praising/scolding as needed. Sometimes it takes a while for nature to change, there are sub-levels of nature &#40;so, a &#34;worst&#34; monster can be even worse than another &#34;worst&#34; monster&#41; so you could be the worst-possible neutral nature, and need more praise/scold events to break into good nature. If that doesn&#39;t work you might just have to give up on good nature for your CP. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know CPs well enough to say anything about them specifically, could be that the breed you have just can&#39;t break into good nature.

 Yes it&#39;s a pure CP. <BR> <BR>Man DP&#39;s method doesn&#39;t allow jelly usage at all and stuff, and I&#39;ve been praising all the Greats I can; I moved it to neutral one time and then suddenly many non-nature affecting weeks later it just goes back to Bad; I&#39;m pretty sure I did NOTHING that affected my nature to go there; in fact I remember PRAISING A GREAT just before that and it went back to Bad the week after. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m pretty sure having just the Heel Badge is not a factor as it only affects nature-changing events; I don&#39;t have the Hero Badge yet btw so it&#39;s becoming even more of a problem for me to try and get it up. <BR> <BR>I just hope the excessive battling in its old years will at least give me time to get it Delta Attack to be ready for multiplay... I&#39;m confident that I can maxx it out.

 I would just sell the heel badge, it may not influence it at all really, but worth a shot, not that hard to get another one anyway, you can prob. pick a new one up with a dummy monster using DP&#39;s method.  <BR> <BR>As for it drifting back to bad nature without something to move it, I don&#39;t know the cause of that, I&#39;ve never had an issue with natures moving on their own like that, but I rarely try to force a monster into good nature, I focus on bad natured monsters, and I always sell the Hero/Heel badges. <BR> <BR>From my own testing, and backed by info on this site, some monsters just can not get to some natures. I think Lisa speculated it may be a glitch in the guide to nature that&#39;s in the FAQ, I&#39;m not sure about that, I think it makes more sense as a feature, personally, and it&#39;s something I like about the nature system.  <BR>I don&#39;t know if CP is one of the nature restricted monsters, but it may well be, you might just have to raise a CP/Pixie or CP/Jell to get that tech. I have noticed sub-breeds influencing nature, and changing the range of natures a monster can get - eg. a Joker sub-breed allows Centaur to get bad nature, and the Death Thrust &#40;evil&#41; tech, where the Tiger sub-breed makes it a shining example of nature-restricted good monsters.

 Well, I&#39;ll have to try my hand at a CP/Jell later just to check it out... but I&#39;m not even done raising my CP yet so eh this might take a while. <BR> <BR>The main problem I have with this is that I mainly want the Delta Attack on a CP or a CP/Pixie just because it&#39;s the battle-ready breeds, but Delta Attack being a Special Tec. cannot be passed down via combining. <BR> <BR>Ooooh I need that Hero Badge somehow... <BR> <BR>btw can you guys suggest me what regimen to do for the dummy monster?

 Also yeah I would also think the &#34;nature alignment&#34; &#39;bug&#39; is actually a feature within the game itself, since the description of some monsters really say that some species are naturally like that, like pure Pixie and stuff.

 For dummy monsters I usually use: <BR> <BR>Mo1: <BR>wk1 HD &#40;&#43;15F, &#43;12S&#41; &#40;15,12, LI= 39&#41; <BR>wk2 Mint Leaf &#40;-6S&#41;, LD &#40;&#43;10F, &#43;5S&#41; &#40;25, 11, LI= 47&#41; <BR>wk3 Mint Leaf &#40;-5S&#41;, Rest &#40;-33F, -5S&#41; &#40;0, 1, LI= 2&#41; <BR>wk4 Freeze <BR> <BR>mo2: <BR>wk1 HD &#40;&#43;15F, &#43;12S&#41; &#40;15, 13, LI= 41&#41; <BR>wk2 Mint Leaf &#40;-6S&#41;, LD &#40;&#43;10F, &#43;5S&#41; &#40;25, 12, LI= 49&#41; <BR>wk3 Mint Leaf &#40;-6S&#41;, Rest &#40;-33F, -5S&#41; &#40;0, 1, LI= 2&#41; <BR>wk4 Freeze <BR> <BR>And Month 2&#39;s numbers repeat. Usually rest will recover more than 5 Stress, and if you have a lump of Ice or Fire Stone it is even better.  <BR>I usually give a Nut Oil on each week 1 just to try and help their loyalty, but it&#39;s not really needed. <BR> <BR>The lack of food really hampers dummy monsters, unfortunately, but you can still get them strong enough to tear through rank B to make money back, and I&#39;ve had long-lifespan dummy monsters make it to rank S and even get me peaches for my focus monster. <BR> <BR>As for your CP, maybe the CP/Pixie would be better for getting good nature, if a pure cant, since you don&#39;t seem to want a CP/Jell.
