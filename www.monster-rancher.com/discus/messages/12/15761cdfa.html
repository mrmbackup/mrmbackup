So yeah you guys must have noticed me posting a bit lately and rambling about my Colorpandora... <BR> <BR>Well I&#39;m FINALLY done, and he&#39;s still at the last stages of his prime &#40;at least from my calculations&#41;! I can now at least use him to get back a few Peaches and some disc chips for the expeditions. <BR> <BR>I was so happy that I was somehow able to get Delta Attack even with just a Good nature! It took me quite a number of resets out of desperation though... but it worked! He has Delta Attack! <BR>Put him back to Worst to gain Anger. <BR> <BR>Gave him a test run against my previous champion, the first monster I raised under DP&#39;s method, a Corone <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXrV4y3u3Cw" TARGET="_top">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXrV4y3u3Cw</A> <BR> <BR>A short timeline of the progress of his stats here: https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/887173_445761228822402_409678423_o.jpg <BR> <BR>I&#39;m really, REALLY happy I actually did it. I never thought I&#39;d actually be maxxing out a 1st gen!

 Congrats! I can tell from the video that you&#39;re learning a bit about tech selection and how it affects 2P battles. &#40;like how if a monster has a weak, stupid attack that has a low guts cost, it will just keep using it and missing&#41;

 Congrats!  <BR>Is this your first maxxed monster, or just your first 1st gen to his maxx? <BR> <BR>Just watched the vid, great example of why I love the anger battle special... and also of why I try not to unlock any techs I don&#39;t need.

 This is actually my first maxxed monster. I have not had the time to get Great combinations yet that will be much easier to maxx out, and training a single monster takes a HUGE amount of my free time. <BR> <BR>It might take a while before I actually raise another monster, but I&#39;m really just so happy my CP turned out to be a success...

 I dunno though, when I made the Corone I wasn&#39;t actually aware of tech selection and just learned everything I could &#40;...which probably hit his lifespan so much that it prevented him from maxxing out&#41;. And on hindsight the Colorpandora moves all look really usable except for Vital Ritual... and maybe Giant Whip, I swear CPs have a knack of using Giant Whip whenver they&#39;re at the close range :&#124; <BR> <BR>If I try and go for another monster again, it would probably be a Pulsar. I&#39;ll try and deduce what techniques would be good for a Hare so that I don&#39;t unnecessarily unlock things I don&#39;t need.

 Yeah, CP&#39;s have a pretty good move pool, even vital dance is just an &#34;I win&#34; if it connects usually, since it takes down opponent life and guts to near nothing. Giant whip is their only closest-range tech, isn&#39;t it? &#40;save face attack which is just pretty bad&#41; so it&#39;s no surprise they use it so much at that range. <BR> <BR>Hares have a lot of tech chains, don&#39;t they? might make a 1st gen Pulsar a pain to unlock key techs for &#40;I&#39;m still not sure how exactly to unlock kung-fu kick, it took me 2 generations to get it with the only hall-of-fame &#91;via Most&#93; hare I&#39;ve raised.&#41;

 Vital Ritual just looks like a bad move actually :&#124; Too much risk for all the guts used for it. It works wonders when trying to take out a Pixie though, because Pixies are pretty restricted when it comes to hitting things &#40;Lightning is pretty much the best Pixie move and it only has an A in Hit&#41;, but then again you can&#39;t really count on Vital Ritual to actually hit. <BR> <BR>Kung Fu Kick looks like a good move indeed, but I&#39;m pretty sure the move that makes a Hare so good is 1-2 Punch, especially since the COM likes to spam what is possibly the best AI move in the game; costs only 10 guts, has an S in Hit, has D for damage which is actually high for a Basic move, and is super fast. <BR> <BR>I really wanna avoid the Heavy moves right now, it&#39;s just spelling a huge problem when it comes to 2P matches. Case in point: my Corone keeps changing the outcome of a battle everytime he uses Somersaults, even though it only has a C in Force, just because it hits consistently and a move with at least a D in Force is already good, and going beyond a B in Force is pretty much overkill.

 Yeah, a lot of the really pricey techs &#40;like 50 guts for vital dance&#41; tend to be disappointing, because missing with them puts you so far behind. The ones with good accuracy like Jell&#39;s Jell Copter which has an A in accuracy can be nice, but even then they seem to be overkill. Some heavy techs are worth looking at though, like Naga&#39;s Drill attack, kinda inaccurate &#40;D&#41;, but it&#39;s their only power tech from farthest range and none of the techs in that range are better than D accuracy anyway &#40;If you raise their Int prob. best leaving just eye beam in that slot though... If you can get that tech.&#41; A lot of it really just depends on the breed and battle specials. <BR> <BR>1-2 Punch is one of the better basic techs in the game, you probably don&#39;t need anything else in that range under most circumstances, but I don&#39;t really know hares very well, having only raised like 1 family &#40;about 3 generations&#41; of them in MR2, and never coming quite close to maxxing one.
