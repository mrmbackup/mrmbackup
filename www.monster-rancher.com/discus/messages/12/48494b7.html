This thread will be filed under Raising/Training  <BR> <BR>Sorry for the delay people. I’ve been dealing with a bout of the flu and I had too much fun raising Bristle Cone. I’ll post all the boring details as a reply to this message tonight. The main points are this: RNA’s suggestion that paradoxine could be used to raise a 4000&#43; point Wracky works! Bristle Cone &#40;Wracky/Mocky&#41; is 7years 4Months old. His stats are &#40;drum roll please&#41;  <BR> <BR>LIF – 553 POW – 825 INT – 999 SKI – 801 SPD – 999 DEF – 301 = 4478 total points.  <BR> <BR>With stats like that, it’s not surprising that Bristle Cone is in the hall of fame. I only had to use 5 paradoxines to achieve these results. Again, I’ll post all the boring details tonight on this same thread. If you’d like a little background and didn’t follow the first part of this quest. See the Mocky Project Part 1. On B Campbell’s board, it’s filed under raising/training. On Fade’s, its down the list somewhere.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Correction, the Mocky Project Part 1 is filed under breeding, not raising/training. It&#39;s been so long since I started this, I forgot where I put my original post!  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>look at my revised method in the &#34;raising/training&#34; method, Farmer Jimbo. Go down to the bottom and see what my &#34;drugged&#34; wracky has turned out to be.  <BR> <BR>Get ready for a BIG surprise.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>RNA, do you think you could tell me exactly what paradoxine does? I&#39;m a bit confused here.  <BR> <BR>-- Chris &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Lordelemental@yahoo.com">Lordelemental@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Paradoxine is a drug that takes off about 20 weeks of life but it does:  <BR> <BR>Pros: Power and skill &#43;30 for each succesful drill for 1 month  <BR> <BR>Cons: Other than the lose of 20 weeks of life, a 7-12 point drop in def. and spd. for each successful drill for 1 month.  <BR> <BR>-- Zack &#40;<A HREF="mailto:belgrath16@aol.com">belgrath16@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s something strange:  <BR> <BR>When I was training&#40;with paradoxines in effect&#41;, I noticed that my decreasing SPD and DEF would slow down after it went below the 50pt mark. Eventually, I would lose only 1 point instead of 7 - 12 points. I never actually reached 1SPD and 1DEF. I believe I had an overall low of 9pts in DEF and a bit higher for SPD.  <BR> <BR>I guess you lose more points if you have higher SPD/DEF. I wonder how many points you lose if you had 900 SPD/DEF?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Starting stats for Bristle Cone the Mocky &#40;Wracky/Mock&#41;:  <BR> <BR>LIF – 82 POW – 69 INT – 279 SKI – 61 SPD – 124 DEF – 34; Neutral, Likes Tablets, Dislikes Fish. Started off with 10 attacks.  <BR> <BR>Schedule for the first 10 months: Light Drill, Light Drill, Rest, Paradoxine - Light Drill, Light Drill, Nuts Oil – Light Drill, Mint Leaves – Light Drill, Rest. Repeat four more times. Stats after 10 months:  <BR> <BR>LIF – 181 POW – 669 INT – 300 SKI – 661 SPD – 13 DEF – 3  <BR> <BR>Other items used were 4 smoked snakes and 5 sour jellies. The snakes were used the week BEFORE Bristle Cone went soft. This seemed to give a phenomenal boost in loyalty. It also caused a little bit of a weight problem so the jellies were used to get the weight back up and move him towards good alignment. After this, it’s just training, battling, and an occasional errantry.  <BR> <BR>1 year 0 months: LIF - 220 POW - 669 INT - 300 SKI - 664 SPD - 82 DEF - 9  <BR> <BR>2 years 0 months: LIF - 275 POW - 678 INT - 340 SKI - 664 SPD - 372 DEF - 30  <BR> <BR>3 years 0 months: LIF - 321 POW - 653 INT - 512 SKI - 670 SPD - 626 DEF - 65  <BR> <BR>4 years 0 months: LIF - 333 POW - 690 INT - 646 SKI - 713 SPD - 829 DEF - 100  <BR> <BR>5 years 0 months: LIF - 404 POW - 701 INT - 799 SKI - 720 SPD - 905 DEF - 151  <BR> <BR>6 years 0 months: LIF - 505 POW - 779 INT - 955 SKI - 749 SPD - 998 DEF - 220  <BR> <BR>7 years 0 months: LIF - 530 POW - 801 INT - 961 SKI - 767 SPD - 998 DEF – 265  <BR> <BR>7 years 4 months: LIF - 553 POW - 825 INT - 999 SKI - 801 SPD - 999 DEF – 303  <BR> <BR>That’s the bare bones of it. You could probably use any training method you prefer after the first year. My mocky was ideally suited for this method because: he has long life by nature of his monster type, he had 10 of his eventual 17 attacks at birth, he was combined using ghost chips giving him a &#43;1 on dodge drills, he excelled at speed and int based drills, and all the items he needed were already in inventory. 5 paradoxines, 2 artemis statues, 2 gemini pots, lump of ice, fire stone, gold peach, and silver peach.  <BR> <BR>Why didn’t I use more than 5 paradoxines? Well, I didn’t have anymore. I don’t have a game shark so I had to get mine the hard way. With 7 paradoxines and a more sophisticated training method, it might be possible to achieve a 5000 point wracky. This might also work with other monster types as well. Sorry for the delay and yes I’m still working on the whole combining issue. I post that info later in a separate thread.  <BR> <BR>And now I&#39;ll look at RNA results.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, January 27, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Holy crap batman! That is one butt kicking wracky RNA. I doff my cap in your honor. My raising method for Bristle Cone was a little sloppy. I did not reload nearly as much as I could have. Two extra paradoxines and more careful raising style might get me an extra 600- 800 points. This would get me close to your results, but then again your wracky was first generation and mine was second. Bristle Cone still has some life left in him. If I do nothing but three light drills and rest, he can make it to 8 years old. Unfortunately, Colt suggests retirement at his birthday celebration so he won’t make it much past 8.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, January 27, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Ha, quite a coincidence that you posted your wracky&#39;s stats at different time intervals. You know the saying &#34;great minds think alike?&#34;  <BR> <BR>Also, I was thinking maybe that a 2nd gen wracky would not do as good as a 1st gen if raised with the paradoxine method twice in a row. Now that I&#39;ve decreased my wracky&#39;s lifespan by 3 years, do you think that a 2nd gen wracky would be able to reach a lifespan close to 10 years?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 27, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m beginning to be suspicious of claims that drug use by parents reduces lifespan of the children &#40;Uhhh.. that would be in the MR2 world of course&#41;. In a misguided effort to make my mock&#39;s and wracky&#39;s stats exactly alike in part 1 of my project, I fed charles two doses of paradoxine. The resulting monster Bristle Cone had an extraordinary lifespan. Unless Mocky&#39;s have a natural lifespan that exceeds 13 years old, I don&#39;t think drug use is passed down to the next generation. I intend to use Bristle Cone as a monster in a combination and I intend to use the paradoxine method on that monster as well. I guess I&#39;ll have more info then.  <BR> <BR>BTW I&#39;d like to emphasize that my raising method for my mocky was very sloppy. I could have squeezed out much better stats if I used a method like yours RNA.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, January 28, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Keep me updated when you raise that new combination of drugged parents. It would be nice to know that drugs don&#39;t affect the offspring. Then I would be able to get my 2nd gen wracky to 5994 for sure.  <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t say that it was that sloppy. That is still quite an impressive 1st gen&#40;?&#41; mocky you got. I&#39;m still kinda surprised that I could get my wracky to 5690 anyways.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 30, 2000.
