 I&#39;ve heard _so_ much about people disliking Nitons, or no comments about htem at all. Personally, I say what&#39;s not to like? They&#39;re... uh.... they.... ah.... and... er... <BR> <BR>Ok! So Nitons haven&#39;t got as much going for them as some of the monsters out there. They&#39;re slow, have little skill to speak of &#40;but not as bad as Gaboo, I might like to point out!&#41;, and low power, as well. Their attacks aern&#39;t powerful, they aren&#39;t good at life, and their looks leave something to be desired. So why do I like them so much? Couldn&#39;t tell you. But I _can_ tell you their good parts! <BR> <BR>Nitons are defense-monsters. They have some of the best defense gains in the game, and a &#43;1 on Swim drills makes this even more &#39;appetiznig&#39;. They also have _incredible_ withering attacks, right from the get-go. Your Niton isn&#39;t going to be much of a K.O. monster, but you&#39;d better bet that it makes a heck of an antagonizer. <BR> <BR>Attacks-wise, Nitons have a _lot_ of intelligence attacks. While their intelligence is generally low &#40;for the purebreeds&#41;, getting just about any crossbreed will end up giving you an intelligence-gain boost, which in turn will give you more attack-power. Moer &#39;bang for yuor buck&#39;, if you will. The Sonic Attacks are especially nice, since they chain into bigger ones, and they&#39;re hit techs, as well as will-draining. The heavy shock is a must-have, too. <BR> <BR>Nitons are _not_ a critter for the beginning trainer. They take a lot of patience, a ton of skill, and more than a little heavy work to get what you want. A first generation Niton isn&#39;t going to be the critter of choice,either, but once yuo get the second in, or get some other critter bred with it, yuo&#39;re giong to fnid that they make for a very good, strong, and HARD TO HURT monster.

 Good evaluation, Kurasu. I knew they were tough in DEF, and that was about all I knew about them. What about Guts Regen for them compared to a fast or a slow monster?

 I haven&#39;t done actual counting, but their regen is actually pretty good. Nowhere near a pixie or ghost&#39;s, but it seems to keep up pretty well with the draining. Of course, I used a Niton/Kato for a lot of my evaluation, so I can&#39;t tell you for _certain_. You&#39;d have to watch the Niton the computer plays &#40;as pitiful as he is&#41; to be sure. As I remember, though, it&#39;s enough to keep up with some of the better critters.

 I&#39;ve been raising niton breeds for awhile now.  One is a niton/kato and the other a niton/durahan. <BR>Yes, nitons have great gains for their defense stats, but their other stats &#40;preferably the offensive ones: pow and int and the more needed skill&#41; are awfully low.  Besides, a selketo with very good defense &#40;999&#41; and about 500&#43; to 600&#43; on its other stats would have a better chance to be in the HOF.  A selketo by the way is a arrowhead/ <BR>joker.  What I&#39;m driving at is that arrowheads have better techniques and with better hit percentage.  Most of the more damaging moves of Nitons have C or D hit percentage.  Both my nitons have difficulty raising their skill stats, but through the help of trorons, I&#39;ve raised them to some good extent.  But I&#39;m not yet through with raising them.  I&#39;m finishing my raising project on my niton/durahan &#40;both of my nitons have already 999 defense :D &#41; and later combined it with my niton/kato.   <BR> <BR>Why do I seem to have patience raising these critters?  Well, I like to prove that not all seemingly meak monsters suck in battle and in raising.  I want to proove that a good raising style would surely make any monster a very good monster, a bankable one and a hall of famer.  I&#39;ve <BR>been using RNA&#39;s technique for awhile, with some of Dark Phoenix&#39;s ideas.  Good luck for me.
