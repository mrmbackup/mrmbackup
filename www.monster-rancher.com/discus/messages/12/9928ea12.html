 Over a long period of time, even to date, I&#39;ve noticed that some main breeds of monster will ALWAYS like a certain thing unless the specific monster I&#39;m raising specificly dislikes it. One of these in which I&#39;ve had much experience are the Zuum and Phoenix breeds. Both LOVE Fish and Meat,as I suspect many &#34;predatory&#34; monsters do.&#40;I&#39;ve seen this in my Draco Katos as well, but I&#39;ve only raised 2 or 3 of those, so I&#39;m not entirely sure&#41; I&#39;m not quite sure how I&#39;d test this, as: <BR>1&#41;I&#39;ve yet to unlock all the monsters in any of my games <BR>2&#41;If the sub-breeds can change the preset main-type like/dislikes, it&#39;d take waaaaay too long too test. <BR>I&#39;ve yet to see breed-specific dislikes, but they might be out there.

 Likes/Dislikes are randomly set when you shrine a monster. You can get them to change by simply re-shrining the same CD or re-doing a combination. No monster gets one like/dislike all the time. I have made tab lovers out of every monster I have trained since we learned about the values of foods.

 I think in this case DT is referring to a general like or dislike of the monthly foods or store items, not the specific like/dislike listed in a monster profile.

 There are several hard-coded, hidden &#39;likes&#39; for each breed, and a few random ones. You can see it fairly easily with the gameshark pro, sharklink tools. The random ones are why a monster always asks for one type item &#40;if it asks for items&#41;, but if you start over from the same CD it will ask for a completely different item all the time. For example, I raised several Watermelonys. One always asked for Wool Ball, another always asked for Nuts Oil. DP first noted this, but it&#39;s a huge task to log all of the hidden likes/dislikes for all the breeds. If someone wanted to spend several months hacking the numbers, it would be appreciated, but extremely time consuming. &#40;and without hacking, there&#39;s no way to tell for sure which sector you are looking at: hard-coded or random&#41;

Hi! I&#39;ve actually noticed the same thing with my pixies... pixies ALWAYS like Fish &amp; Cup Jelly &#40;unless it is their specific dislike&#41;, and always hate Meat &#40;unless specifically liked&#41; and in fact this racial preference seems to in some cases overpower their listed &#34;like&#34; or &#34;dislike&#34;. I recently raised a Granity whose &#34;like&#34; was Meat, and she seemed to like it the first time I gave it to her, but appx 6 mo later when I tried to give it to her again, she refused &amp; asked for fish instead! I don&#39;t know about the coded numbers, but I raise a LOT of pixies &#40;okay, almost exclusively pixies&#41; and this has always been the case with them. :&#41;

 Hello.  It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve wandered to this corner of the web.  It&#39;s funny that I noticed this subject when I did.  A few days ago, I was looking through some old notebooks of mine when I found some of my old MR2 research notes.  And guess what?  I just so happened to include my notes concerning the default food likes/dislikes of each of the breeds! With any luck, I might have that data availible here very soon. <BR> <BR>A few comments before I go: <BR> <BR>1.  The specific likes and dislikes ALWAYS take precedence when determining a monster&#39;s like or dislike of certain foods with a few possible exceptions. See #2. <BR> <BR>2. In the case of Pixie Misa&#39;s meat loving Granity, did the monster&#39;s Like change from Meat to the Trainer? &#40;This happens when a monster&#39;s loyalty gets high, about 75 or so.&#41;  In a case where the monsters like or dislike changes to that of the trainer, the food like/dislike reverts to the default.  &#40;Side Note:  Yes, it IS possible for a monster&#39;s Dislike to change to the Trainer, however, this is rare.  A trainer must be REALLY abusive for this to happen.&#41; <BR> <BR>3.  This is not confirmed yet, just an observation, but it appears that the primary breed establishes the monster&#39;s likes and dislikes in terms of food.  I may post more data on this if it becomes availible. <BR> <BR> <BR>Yes, I am alive :&#41;  Just remaining dormant until MR4 <BR>comes out.... <BR> <BR>DP

 Hey, nice to &#34;see&#34; you again!  Thank you for the compliments.  Well, anyway, there&#39;s one more thing that I forgot to mention yesterday: <BR> <BR>ALL monsters like Milk at Stage 1 unless specifically disliked.  Once the monster grows out of this stage, the monster&#39;s attitude towards Milk revert to the default setting. <BR> <BR>DP

Hi! Oddly enough, this was early enough in my Granity&#39;s life that she hadn&#39;t changed her like to Me yet, I even went and checked on the like/dislike page right afterward wondering why on earth she didn&#39;t want it.  <BR>And incidentally, you DON&#39;T necessarily have to be abusive to get them to dislike you! My first instance of raising a Janne, with the EXACT same methods I use for all my others, early in her life her dislike DID shift to me, even though my training style was listed as Soft! &#40;I assume this is because I scolded her anytime she cheated, and she cheated ALL THE TIME.&#41; However, she also wound up my first-ever monster w/ 100 loyalty! &#40;go figure.&#41; But I was not the least bit abusive to her in any way! So you don&#39;t have to be Evil to get them to dislike you...  <BR>Also, I think it is the Primary breed that gives the innate likes/dislikes, because I have raised lots of types of pixies, and the likes/dislikes seem to remain the same... :&#41;
