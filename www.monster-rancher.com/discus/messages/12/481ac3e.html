Mocks-When I got this monster the stats were just totally disapointing&#40;except for life and intelligence&#41; come on 50 strength and was it 40 def.I decided to give it a try starting with a bad attitude at the ranch it kept asking for extra favors and keeps asking to want to play,it also fails frequently on its drills. I gave it 6 magic bananas to boost its loyalty so that it will like me and enable it to fail less frequently.It took a long time for it to mature 5 years I think&#40;that means 4 years an 11 months of 5,7 and 10 max stat gains on drills&#41;WOW! that would means this monster would live over 7 years&#40;this was back in the day when a monster living over 6 years was a miracle&#41;with any of the peaches but any peaches were not needed this one lived for 9years and became the most powerful monster I have ever raised.Training it in skill and life at the begining is a must and must concentrate on maxing out Intelligence after.In battle it fuctions well with the one hit wonder tactic&#40;Its special tec twister does a lot of damage &#41;if it backfires any other monster might panic with low speed,low defence and no guts to spare,dont worry high life will save the day.Its final stats are :Gonzles mock/mock Life:867 Power:159 Intelligence:999 Skill:838 Speed:405 Defence:377 this monster is good for newbeis and advanced dont get intiminated by its pathetic stats if raised right,that means dont abuse it no tournaments,no drugs,and limited errantries.  <BR> <BR>Jokers-Wicked looking monster,hard to raise,short life , powerful........what else can I say this one will definately require a skilled trainer not recomended for begginers Jokers will need a trainer with patience, experience and skill.They can be very powerful as they have already proven in S class and the major 4 there one is purebreed and the one in the major 4 is a Joker/Dragon Flare Death.They are very offensive good at Intelligence,Power,and skill. They have very few moves but are all very nice each seems to have a nice withering effect.It will take a long time to get a joker to live over 7 years&#40;I ecxept it to be 4th or 5th&#41; if any body has achived this I salute you as a true master!  <BR> <BR>next issue Wrackys and Ghost  <BR> <BR>-- stupid &#40;<A HREF="mailto:twopacliveson@hotmail.com">twopacliveson@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 01, 2000
