Wracky- One of the coolest monsters in the game. Super-high guts regen, long life span for getting good stats, and a completely filled-out move list where almost every move is worthwhile make this one a little killer for sure. Early on you might have alot of problems, but even in those times, a simple combination of its high guts regen and inexpensive Weapon attack mean that you could just get in the enemy&#39;s face and keep using the slow and weak but accurate and cheap move over and over, giving them hardly any chance to attack. Air Shot and Blast Shot are also useful for the Combo King strategy, and Necromancy and Trick can wither an opponent away to single-digit guts often in one hit &#40;Note: Trick does not seem to hit nearly as often as Necromancy, making it the better choice. And death to the rumor that Nercomancy disables Grit&#41;. Spin Slash is also good for the rare NICE Wracky &#40;who also needs high Power&#41;, but the real fun comes with Special Techs. Cursed Dance not only rules in terms of looks, but its stats &#40;B/C/B/S&#41; are sure to scare anyone. And who cares about 55 Guts Cost when it can pull off four of those attacks in a single battle? Head Spike and Fire Spike are also well-balanced and effective, and Explosion....just rules. I&#39;ve never tried it on a Speed Demon, but I use it against Tanks quite frequently, and it&#39;s never missed yet. Just make sure to build up the Wracky&#39;s Defense to about equal its Power, and the backlash damage will mean nothing, whereas your opponent will probably be killed in one hit &#40;or at least brought so close with all its guts removed that you can easily finish it with a weak attack like Air Shot&#41;. If you haven&#39;t raised one of these, DO IT.  <BR> <BR>Hopper- No, Hoppers don&#39;t suck. You just probably don&#39;t know how to use them. They are MADE for the Combo King strategy- high guts regen, weak-but-accurate-and-cheap attacks with relatively long animations, it&#39;s all there. Remember, it doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t knock out your opponent, or even that you get that many HITS in on them. If you get one hit in on them, and they hardly ever get a chance to attack YOU &#40;due to you monopolizing the battle and withering their guts bit by bit&#41;, and if your Speed is so high that those few oppurtunities fail, you win every time. And then you do the snide little Hopper Laugh &#40;&#34;NYA!&#34;&#41; while they swear eternal hatred towards you. And you laugh at them more.  <BR> <BR>Phoenix- Yeah, I know, &#34;Why the hell do I need strategies to win with the fenix neway? It kiks @$$!!!!&#34; Well, the answer is that what if your little One-Hit Wonder strategy fails due to a smarter/luckier opponent? If you don&#39;t think you have any chance of losing, your chance of failure skyrockets. Here&#39;s the deal: No one works on a Phoenix&#39;s Power. Not even the computer &#40;The Blue Phoenix only has like 200-something Power&#41;. And while its far-ranged, intelligence-based moves can destroy the competition...you may notice that when it&#39;s computer-controlled, your Phoenix often doesn&#39;t go back into far range, and gets whomped while it tries to do puny short-range physical attacks. That&#39;s how you beat that overconfident jerk next door. Get right into the borderline between short-range and mid-range, and don&#39;t let them get out of there. Your enemy won&#39;t be able to use effective attacks, and they won&#39;t be able to back off quickly enough for you to not follow them. Don&#39;t get too close, though, or they&#39;ll push you back into far range and cream you. Meanwhile, you can trash them with your most-probably-better short and mid-range moves, and unless they&#39;ve raised all defensive stats up pretty high &#40;and I bet they haven&#39;t&#41;, you can snuff them out in no time, especially with Power-based moves.  <BR> <BR>WHOO! I gotta take a break for a bit...I&#39;ll be back later with strategies for Color Pandora, Kato, Niton, Undine, Mocchi, Durahan, and possibly a few others.  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000  <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t raised any Hengers in MR2, so I couldn&#39;t pass on their strategies yet. But since the Ghost is pretty much the exact same creature as in MR1, I can help on it.  <BR>Ghost- This thing has Guts Regen off the scale, but poor abilities. Use the first thing to your advantage- these monsters are perfect for the Combo King strategy. Most of their abilities have lower-grade Accuracy, so raising a Ghost&#39;s Skill high is a must in order to effectively use them. If you keep using Surprise, you can easily Antagonize an opponent the whole battle. Magic Cards is probably its best Intelligence-based move, but its truly greatest moves are Uppercut and Combination, which are unusual here because a Ghost generally relies on intelligence-based attacks, but these are Power- based moves. Still, if you want to work on Power, you can really trash an opponent with Combination &#40;55 Cost, which is near- meaningless to a Ghost, and B/B/B/E as its stats&#41;. In order to defeat enemy Ghosts &#40;either a player&#39;s or Ofrey&#41;, keep in very close, where its weak Power-based attacks can barely scratch you. If it pushes you away, get right back in close range, and continue trashing it.  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000.
