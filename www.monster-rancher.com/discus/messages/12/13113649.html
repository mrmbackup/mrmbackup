 Did anyone besides me laugh when they saw the Undine they unlocked from the Undine Slate? &#34;What horrible stats!&#34; I told my brother-in-law, &#34;She won&#39;t be worth a crap!!&#34; I should be slapped and banned from playing MR2 after this. I just finished raising her, using Dark Phoenix method. When I first started using her on this method, she was 1 month old. I had brought her to the ranch for a month earlier. Why? I don&#39;t know. Anyway, here are some stats for the greatest monster to grace the presence of my ranch: <BR> <BR>Monster used: Ariel 1st Gen Undine from slate <BR> <BR>Method: Dark Phoenix&#39;s &#40;in&#41;famous raising method <BR> <BR>Items held for effect: 2 Dino Tails, 2 Sculptures, 2 Gemini Cups, 1 Firestone <BR> <BR>Drugs Used: Troron &#40;3&#41; <BR>Items Used &#40;other than Nuts Oil&#41;:38 Magic Banana&#39;s, 21 Mint Leaves, 11 Candies, 4 Powders <BR> <BR>Errantries: 6  <BR> <BR>Techs Learned: Splash, Kiss, Arrow, Aqua Wave, Cold Geyser, Hailstorm <BR> <BR>Beginning Funds: 231460G <BR>Ending Funds: 376500G <BR> <BR>Begin Stats 0 yrs 1 mos: LIF 50, POW 10, INT 173, SKI 100, SPD 100, DEF 60 <BR> <BR>End Stage 1 0 yrs 5 mos: LIF 106, POW 120, INT 173, SKI 191, SPD 100, DEF 60 <BR> <BR>End Stage 2 1 yrs 4 mos: LIF 157, POW 97, INT 321, SKI 308, SPD 390, DEF 61 <BR> <BR>End Stage 3 2 yrs 3 mos: LIF 172, POW 34, INT 660, SKI 434, SPD 929, DEF 38 <BR> <BR>Ariel received Gold Peach here to extend prime. <BR> <BR>End Extended Prime 4 yrs 4 mos: LIF 353, POW 119, INT 985, SKI 976, SPD 963, DEF 207 <BR> <BR>FINAL STATS 5 yrs 9 mos: LIF 514, POW 205, INT 999, SKI 999, SPD 999, DEF 371  TOTAL: 4087  <BR>  <BR>RECORD: 70W-0L 67KO&#39;s. Other 3 victories not by knockout were where opponent gave up. <BR> <BR>Purse won: 184300G <BR> <BR>This was an incredible monster to raise. It was the first time I had a monster give me anything worth using. She gave me 11 Ocean Stones, which I sold at 1000G each. She won the Major 4, defeated Poritoka in the Legends Cup, and was in the Hall Of Fame before turning 4. She proceeded to go through the M4 at least 3 more times after that. She was also the first monster I&#39;ve used that maxxed out 3 stats.  <BR> <BR>Next objective: Find a great combination to mix her with, and train another one. But first, I&#39;ll train Gonzo II, my 2nd gen Garuda with some butt-kickin&#39; stats.

 Great info! I&#39;ve always thought that raising techniques were as important, or more, than great starting stats. I recall a very old post by B. Campbell on the old board where he said he thought there was no such thing as a &#34;best&#34; monster. There are tricks to getting the best out of certain types of monsters, but the rancher&#39;s skill is the real key.

 Some people can train certain types of monsters better than others. I have had little or no luck with Mocks, Suezo, &amp; Katos to name a few, but I&#39;ve done pretty well with Durahan&#39;s, Phoenix &#40;Love those Garuda&#39;s!&#41;, Bajarl&#39;s, and now add Undine to the mix. I also would have to say that I agree with you in the fact that there is no &#34;best&#34; monster. I trained a pure hopper &#40;which most people hate&#41; to S Class, and it won 3 of the M4 and won Elder&#39;s Cup for me. Lived to over 6 yrs. old. Not too bad for a 1st gen Hopper in my book.

 A moment of silence for my first, and so far, only Undine. She got smooshed by Rockgeiger when she was just a young &#39;un, and didn&#39;t pull through. I actually hadn&#39;t planned to work on another one for a while, but seeing the progression of yours makes me tempted to!

 i stupidly threw out my slate undine.  luckily, i had crash bandicoot warped, and got my undine back by using the siren you get there in combos.

 What kind of Undine did you end up with, as far as stats?

 my undine born from combining a siren and a daina started with ~350 int, 100-200 everything else.  ended up with 950 int, 900 ski and spd, and acceptable everything else; lived long enough to win a silver peach, also beat poritoka to go into the hall o fame.

Incredibly enough, exactly 7 months later, I finished raising Ariel II, the 2nd generation to my Undine line. Needless to say, I haven&#39;t played much up until the past few days. Here&#39;s some vitals on Ariel II, who&#39;s sitting in the freezer until I find something that I can get a great/good combo out of: <BR> <BR><B>NAME:</B> Ariel II <BR><B>MONSTER TYPE:</B> 2nd Gen Undine {Undine/Undine&#41; <BR><B>ACQUIRED:</B> Combined Ariel 1st Gen Undine, &amp; Cruella  1st Gen Siren &#40;Undine/Joker&#41; <BR><B>BEGINNING STATS:</B> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>LIF</TD><TD>POW</TD><TD>INT</TD><TD>SKI</TD><TD>SPD</TD><TD>DEF </TD></TR><TR><TD>164</TD><TD>56</TD><TD>397</TD><TD>347</TD><TD>349</TD><TD>141</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR><B>END STAGE 1:</B> 0 yrs. 10 mos. <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>LIF</TD><TD>POW</TD><TD>INT</TD><TD>SKI</TD><TD>SPD</TD><TD>DEF </TD></TR><TR><TD>180</TD><TD>58</TD><TD>432</TD><TD>460</TD><TD>369</TD><TD>144</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR><B>END STAGE 2:</B> 1 yr. 11 mos. <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>LIF</TD><TD>POW</TD><TD>INT</TD><TD>SKI</TD><TD>SPD</TD><TD>DEF </TD></TR><TR><TD>223</TD><TD>43</TD><TD>718</TD><TD>674</TD><TD>508</TD><TD>172</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR><B>FREEZY POP:</B> 4 yrs. 3 mos. <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>LIF</TD><TD>POW</TD><TD>INT</TD><TD>SKI</TD><TD>SPD</TD><TD>DEF </TD></TR><TR><TD>402</TD><TD>59</TD><TD>885</TD><TD>905</TD><TD>883</TD><TD>664</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Ariel II received Golden &amp; Silver Peach, and is another HOF&#39;er for me.

 NOT BAD.  I managed to get all techs with my last Undine, but your Ariel&#39;s stats trump my Evian&#39;s by about 150 in all stats &#40;except Life and Power, where mine is a little stronger&#41;.  A fight between the two would be an outstanding match-up.
