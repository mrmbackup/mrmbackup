 Ok, here&#39;s my method, and I&#39;ve just begun to try it on a henger/henger called Infinity.  So far, the results are very good. <BR> <BR>Infinity &#40;Henger/Henger&#41; <BR>2 years and 5 months <BR>He&#39;s in stage 3 &#40;after the first growth, before prime&#41; <BR> <BR>Lif Pow Int Ski Spd Def <BR>215 372 238 639 564 134 <BR> <BR>He started with about 900 composite, two basic techs, and 4 others &#40;one of each kind, withering, sharp, etc.&#41;  He&#39;s gotten 3 more techs for me though. <BR> <BR>Now I won&#39;t put the numbers down, because it would take me forever, but just trust me, as I&#39;ve gone over them a couple of times.  HD = hard drill, LD = light drill, MB = magic banana, ML = mint leaf, NO = nuts oil, TB means Tablet, and RT = rest.  Here it is... <BR> <BR>Drills HD LD HD LD <BR>Items: NO ML NO ML <BR> <BR>This only works with monsters that like tablets, or a HAD monster who is either ok, or likes tablets.  I always train the best stats first, and then the weaker ones during the prime.  I usually won&#39;t let my stats go above 850 until they&#39;re all at about 850 for HD and tourney purposes. <BR> <BR>When going on an errantry, I always go on the first week of the month, after feeding it a NO.  Afterwords I go... <BR> <BR>RT HD LD HD TB HD LD HD LD TB <BR>NO MB NO ML &#40;&#41; NO ML NO ML &#40;&#41; <BR> <BR>Then on with the normal schedule. <BR> <BR>For battles, I only battle on weeks 2 and 4, seeing as they work this way, and how all the important battles &#40;gold, platina, official, legend, big 4, sculpture, and etc.&#41; fall on these weeks.  I feed a MB instead of a ML before the battle.  After a battle, there are two methods.  The first one is if the battle is on week 4, the second is if the battle is on week 2. <BR> <BR>Week 4 battle: <BR>LD LD HD LD TB <BR>NO NO ML NO &#40;&#41; <BR> <BR>Week 2 battle: <BR>LD HD TB HD LD HD LD TB  <BR>NO NO &#40;&#41; NO ML NO ML &#40;&#41; <BR> <BR>With both the errantry, and the battle, you need to go all the way through to the end of what I posted before going on another errantry, or another battle. <BR> <BR>This method is intended for the longest lifespan possible, you lose no life unless going to a battle or errantry, but the losses are minimal.  Also, the errantry method works under the worst conditions of sleep &#40;getting the least fatigue and stress taken away&#41; ONLY IF you have either a fire stone, or an ice block. <BR> <BR>LIVING FOREVER <BR> <BR>I have not tried this out yet, but I think that it&#39;ll work.  In order to get the best stats, you need to save the week before you grow the second time &#40;right before prime&#41;.  Then &#40;if you have stress or fatigue&#41; feed you monster a magic banana and rest him to get down to no stress and no fatigue &#40;you should have low stress and low fatigue the week before you grow or this won&#39;t work&#41;.  Now, you can either do 3 light drills &#40;each with a magic banana&#41; and then rest &#40;with a magic banana&#41; or you can do a hard drill, a light drill, and then rest &#40;each with magic bananas&#41;.  This ensures that you won&#39;t lose a week of lifespan from stress or fatigue.  But, if you&#39;re week 4, and you&#39;ve just rested &#40;on week 3&#41; you can do a HD, feed tablets, then do another HD, and then rest.  If the tablet feeding comes between doing 3 LD&#39;s, I wouldn&#39;t do anything, although technically you could do another LD.  You can&#39;t go to any battles or errantry&#39;s with that monster while you&#39;re doing this.  Now, when you run out of Loyalty from the MB&#39;s, save your game before feeding another MB. You can check if a MB gave you another week by giving it to your monster, and then doing a drill or resting or whatever.  If your monster grows for the second time and hits his prime, then the MB didn&#39;t work, and you can reload the saved game and try feeding it to him again.  Do this until he doesn&#39;t grow, and you just keep on doing this to live for as long as you want.  I will say though, that this method &#40;although not tried by me&#41; will probably take a lot of time for reloading and making sure the MB did it&#39;s job.   <BR> <BR>Anyway, that&#39;s it.  Post your comments, and I&#39;ll keep you informed on how my results go.  When my henger reaches that week before prime, I&#39;ll try out the live forever method I posted and see if it works.   <BR> <BR>Split Infinities &#40;SI&#41;

 The problem with making a monster live forever is that the only way you can tell if the banana worked is to watch the loss of 10 loyalty. If you&#39;re down to 5 or less loyalty, how can you tell? Right there is the crux of making a monster &#39;live forever&#39;, unfortunately.

 That&#39;s what I thought of Kurasu. You give the bananas to your monster the week before his second growth into prime.  That way, if the banana worked, he won&#39;t grow the next week, but if you do grow, then you know the banana didn&#39;t work.

 I&#39;m sure if you brought out an extremely loyal monster &#40;maybe a tiger&#41; on the 4th week and did HD, LD, Rest &#40;on the 4th weeks&#41; and it liked Tablet and/or magic banana &#40;ex: my durahan that I said I had to feed a magic banana and great to max out it&#39;s life only had 8 loyalty taken away from the MB and I&#39;m positive it got the life gain because I tried Light drilling him in run and he&#39;d die everytime, he lived with the MB&#41; then you might be able to get one to live forever.

 I remember being told that you must have 10 loyalty for the bananna to work for the &#43;1 week. <BR>Can any one verify this, if so then I&#39;ll try out my theory on it.

 actually, in chat a little while ago, dark phoenix explained to me a method that enables the trainer to know if he/she got the life extending effect of the banana even when loyalty is less than 10.  rather than try to reconstruct my garbled memory, i will hope he sees this post.  or else i will mention it to him if i see him.

 WHOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Alright, I was 100% correct in my theory of living forever.  I&#39;ll try and explain it again here.  The week before your monster gets his second growth &#40;prime&#41;, you feed him a magic banana, lowering his loyalty by ten. Then you rest him or what not. Anyway, this is my schedule with my monster. <BR> <BR>Week 2 RT MB <BR>Week 3 LD MB <BR>Week 4 HD MB <BR>Tablets  <BR>Week 1 LD MB <BR>Week 2 RT MB <BR>Week 3 LD MB <BR>Week 4 HD MB <BR>Tablets <BR>And etc.   <BR> <BR>It gets a bit harder to tell if your monster is losing the 10 loyalty if your style is different &#40;fond, soft, strict, etc.&#41; because either your fear, or your spoil gets to zero first, and the number of loyalty you lose could be 7, or 6, or 5. After your monster&#39;s loyalty is around zero, or at zero, when you feed a MB it can&#39;t lower loyalty. So if your loyalty goes down to, or stays at zero, then I&#39;ll save it &#40;I keep one save for before feeding a MB, and one for after I feed it&#41;.  Then I&#39;ll try a drill, or rest, whatever is needed.  If he stays small, then the magic banana has worked.  You can use this until your stats are as high as you want.  Then you have all the time of prime and after prime to battle or go on errantries.  YOU CAN LIVE AS LONG AS YOU WANT WITH THIS METHOD.  But don&#39;t take my word for it, try it out, it works.  It costs money though, 1100 a month with tablets, so I suggest that you get a lot of money first.   <BR> <BR>SI

 But then Stress and Fatigue would be a  <BR>problem, right?  If you never give it any Mint  <BR>Leaves and all that junk?  And battles would  <BR>be hard to fight in, since Loyalty would be very  <BR>low, he&#39;d use Foolery constantly.

 No, as long as you rest on the weeks that I posted, stress and fatigue aren&#39;t a problem.  No, you can&#39;t do battles or errantries while you&#39;re doing this, but you can do them after you&#39;ve got your stats where you want them, and continue with a regular method.  You most likely would use a couple of months after getting off of this method to get up loyalty before going to battles, maybe feed them smoked snakes and apple cakes while resting every other week and doing HD&#39;s the other weeks.  But after using this, you have quite a bit of regular lifespan to use up for battles and etc.  You can also use gold and silver peaches after this method giving your monster another 75 weeks.

 Wow, thanks you guys.  You make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

Or does the -5 work as well, because so far, as long as my loyalty stays at 0 when I feed a MB, it still gains a week. I haven&#39;t had any trouble with having it be a -5 or -10 loyalty.

 Well you guys, I have some bad news... my memory card um, well I don&#39;t know what happened, but it got erased somehow :&#40; Anyway, this will put me behind schedule a bit.  However, I keep another save of my game on another memory card &#40;after my first &#39;all-games-deleted&#39; thing&#41;.  It wasn&#39;t as far as I HAD gotten with Infinity, but I still have him, so it&#39;s not that far back.  Anyway, it&#39;ll probably take me a day or two to get back to where I was, so I&#39;ll spend all my free time getting him back into shape for a while.  Thanks for all the comments! I&#39;ll get back to you all on how he&#39;s doing soon.

 Ok, here&#39;s some words for the wise about this method.  First, if you&#39;re going to use this, I suggest getting the stats your monster doesn&#39;t like up first &#40;when he&#39;s got loyalty&#41;.  Because when you&#39;re feeding him MB&#39;s every week, and he has no loyalty, getting him to success on drills he doesn&#39;t like, takes a long time. Also, I suggest if you need techs for your monster, that you go on errantries and battle more to unlock chained moves before the week before prime.  Also, if I continue to not have a problem with the -5/-10 loyalty thing, this could probably work during a monster&#39;s prime, which would get better stats than what I&#39;m doing now.  Ok, that&#39;s all the odd info I&#39;ve got on this method so far...

I figure he&#39;s getting between 60% and 70% of the gains he could be getting doing a HD LD HD LD method. It&#39;s almost been 3 years since I&#39;ve been doing this, and since I haven&#39;t run into a single instance of having to worry about whether or not he got a -5 loyalty, or a -10 loyalty, I think I&#39;ll move him into his prime, and continue this method.

 WOW!!!  It&#39;s, so pretty, I like hengers, oh Split Infinites, why not just max out the stats and worry about the errantries and battle later, so what if you don&#39;t like seeing &#43;0/&#43;0, it&#39;s just safer to do.  That way you&#39;ll know he&#39;s maxed.

 He&#39;s got 75 right now, but he just used a MB for a battle.  It only took 3-4 months after going off my method to get his loyalty up to 50, maybe 6-8 months to get up around 80.  btw, what&#39;s the first way to max any monster?

 Good job!  Though I came up with a method that has consistently maxxed monsters, this is the first method I&#39;ve seen that, if followed properly and diligently, GUARANTEES a maxxed stat monster.  Congratulations! <BR> <BR>&#40;I think I&#39;ll leaves the all hails up to Torey :&#41;&#41;

 Yes!!! This looks very, very, interesting. A question, though. Would this work on say, a Draco Moochi? for example? If not, I&#39;ll just try this on my Renocraft.

 That&#39;s correct DP, but I made it for a monster that likes tablets. I&#39;ll need to look at it again to see about monsters who are only neutral to tablets.  btw, I&#39;m going to start in on a Metal Glay pretty soon, I&#39;m going to try paroxidines and try a couple things I recommended after raising Infinity.  I&#39;ll keep you all posted...

 It&#39;s your &#34;Living Forever&#34; section that makes this method stand out.  Actually, with a little tweaking, it is entirely possible to tailor this to monsters who are neutral to or even DISLIKE Tablets.  Just expect the stat boost process to take longer...

 I would only suggest using 2 paradoxines, I was thinking about training one of those with this method too, guess I&#39;ll go back to the drawing board...

 Yes, the &#39;Time Freeze&#39; method, as well as Mepersoner&#39;s not so famous method &#40;listed above and in his method&#41; will work for any monster that likes, or is neutral to tablets.  Now, any monster should at least be neutral to tablets.  If you want a monster that dislikes tablets, you best bet is to cut out a HD and plug in a LD.  I could find the specifics, but it&#39;s like every 3 months you can do a HD.  I don&#39;t find that flexible enough, so I&#39;d just go LD RT LD LD with MB&#39;s every week.  Corpse, I doubt you&#39;ll need your Draco Mochhi to live 13&#43; years.  According to Mepersoner&#39;s stat gains, Draco Mochhi&#39;s get the best stat gains in the game &#40;overall that is&#41;.

 Well I started a selketo using this method, it doesn&#39;t as long as DP&#39;s method in my opinion, but it is still quite annoying, I&#39;ll let you know how it turns out.  He&#39;s been in prime for almost 2 years now.  His stats suck, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m used to 2 HD&#39;s a month so he doesn&#39;t get as strong as fast, but it will come out in the long run at the look of things.

 Well, I finally got some playtime in, and I decided to use it for giving this method a run. I was orignally going to do this on a Draco Moochi, but my friend sold the only CD that he had that made one, so I decided to use a Joker that was already in his second size of growth. At first, I felt a little skepical about this, but when my Joker, Morgawr &#40;his name&#41;reached 5yrs without priming, I was sold immediatly on this. So, I thought I&#39;d post his stats as a testament to how amazing this has turned out for me.  <BR>Name: Morgawr <BR>Age:5yr4mo &#40;3rd gen&#41; <BR>Stats:&#40;started with 1000&#43; composite&#41; <BR>Lif:721,Pow:705,Int:736,Ski:886,Spd:135,Def:426 <BR>He has the normal two Joker techs, plus he started with Death Energy. As soon as I get some more playtime, &#40;too many <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> responsiblites&#41; I&#39;m gonna max him out &#40;before prime&#41;and turn him Worst natured so I can get the rest of his techs. I have to say, SI that your method here is, IMO, the absoulte best method I&#39;ve ever tried. Thank you for posting this for the public to view and use.

 Hey just thought of something, I think the method would work better if it went LD, Rest, HD, LD because the monster is has less stress and fatigue and it seems that increases the chances of them succeeding. <BR> <BR>O btw Lisa, sorry to hear &#39;bout the Hard drive problems, I tried to get here about 11:30 last night, and it was down.

 A question that I&#39;d like to ask, does the Banana set your monster back 1 week?  Or does it add one week to your lifespan.  If you set back the monster one week after using a Paradoxine wouldn&#39;t that mean it can be used infinitely since the 1 month would never pass?  I&#39;m kinda doubting it but it&#39;d be pretty <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> sweet.

 as i understand &#34;bananaology&#34;, chaosphere, using the split infinities method kinda treads water - the banana gains you a week of life, which you use by living during that week.  so as long as you lose no lifespan to stress or fatigue, you kinda live in that week of your monster&#39;s lifespan &#91;the week before prime, specifically&#93; as long as you can stand it.  maybe he should have named it the &#34;groundhog day&#34; method, after the bill murray movie...

 Umm... <BR> <BR>So can you summarize the schedule?  I can&#39;t seem to understand cleary how to raise the monsters while your doing the living infinitely method.  Do you feed a magic banana the week before prime and go like this?: <BR> <BR>&#40;LD,LD,LD,RT&#41;&#40;MB,MB,MB,MB&#41; <BR> <BR>Please cap me on this.

 as i understand it &#91;which is secondhand and through reading rather than through personal experience&#93; there are two key points to the si plan.  for further specifics, consult the thread itself. <BR> <BR>1&#93;  feeding the banana at the week before prime ensures that the banana fulfills its function as a life extending item.  if it grows, you did not get the effect; if it remains smaller, you did. <BR> <BR>2&#93;  even if the banana works, it can only gain for you one week of lifespan...enough to counteract the actual week your monster lived.  any additional lifespan loss thru stress or fatigue would therefore put you into prime.  that is where the interlocking drills/rest regimen kicks in.  you will have only the fed item &#91;tabs, of course&#93; to cut down on fatigue and stress - nuts oil and mint leafs are unavailable to you, because you are spending your weekly item quota on bananas.  so you must structure your drils so as to never cause your monster to experience fatigue and/or stress which would nullify the advantage conferred upon your monster by the bananas. <BR> <BR>these are the concepts involved.  split infinities set forth a regimen which he proved to have allowed statgain without lifespan loss to stress/fatigue.  however, as long as the concepts are obeyed, there must necessarily be others which would accomplish the same end. <BR> <BR>hope this helps.

 Well, I can&#39;t really do the math involved in this so would a schedule of say, three light drills and a rest work?  That is of course using bananas all the time.  And what about stress?  Wouldn&#39;t that accumulate?

 Okay here&#39;s a break down of it. <BR>&#40;HD, Rest, LD, LD&#41; &#40;MB,MB,MB,MB&#41; Always feed Tablet.   <BR>I think this works better myself, but I did the math in my head just so you know. <BR>&#40;LD, Rest, HD, LD&#41; &#40;MB,MB,MB,MB&#41; <BR>Remember if your monster is to far into prime to shrink then the only way to get the &#43;1 week of lifespan is to get -10 loyalty &#40;or something really close -11, -9, sometimes the monsters like/dislike the bananas&#41; or to get hit a 0 in loyalty after feeding the banana &#40;as in your monster&#39;s loyalty has to be 0&#41;.

 Ok, I&#39;ve been gone a while, but I&#39;m back.  One misconception that I&#39;ve noticed here is that you don&#39;t have to have your monster at the week before prime.  I used it to make sure this method worked, but when you use a magic banana either spoil and fear goes up &#40;&#43;10&#41; spoil goes down and fear goes up and vice-versa &#40;&#43;5, -5&#41;, or you gain a week, and both spoil and fear go down &#40;-10&#41;.  Now if you&#39;re at 0 loyalty and you get a -5, it doesn&#39;t count, but the other &#43; does count, so you gain loyalty.  The only way to stick at 0 loyalty is to get a -10 loyalty and gain an extra week of life.  So, you can be in prime and use this method.  Just one more time in nice bold caps, &#34;YOU CAN BE IN PRIME WHEN USING THIS METHOD, YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO BE AT THE WEEK BEFORE PRIME.&#34;  Ok, hope that helps you guys, and helps get your monster&#39;s stats up sooner...   <BR> <BR>&#40;SI&#41;

 Hmm, I don&#39;t think I explained that quite right, let me try again.  If you use a MB at 0 loyalty, there are 4 events that can happen.  &#40;1.&#41; You can get a &#43;10 spoil and a &#43;10 fear giving you &#43;10 loyalty and -1 week of lifespan.  &#40;2.&#41;  You can get a &#43;10 spoil and a -10 fear &#40;or something like that&#41; and get a &#43;5 loyalty overall and no change in lifespan.  &#40;3.&#41; You can get a -10 spoil and a &#43;10 fear for an overall -5 loyalty and no change in lifespan.  &#40;4.&#41; You can get a -10 spoil and a -10 fear for an overall decrease of -10 loyalty and a &#43;1 week of lifespan. <BR> <BR>Now, if your loyalty is at 0, and you get either a &#43; or - 5, the - number doesn&#39;t count, because loyalty can&#39;t go below 0, but the other &#43; number does count, so you get an overall increase of loyalty either way.  The only way your loyalty stays at 0 is if you get both spoil and fear subtracted &#40;or negative, whatever&#41;.  And that gives you a &#43;1 week of lifespan.  So you CAN be in prime, or any other stage you want to do this in.  I hope that clears up what I said earlier. <BR> <BR>&#40;SI&#41;

 I just started this method last night on a Pebbly-wracky/golem.I decided to try it out at the week before its 1st growth to see how it works. <BR>I made sure I was at the very week of the growth. <BR>While still having 17 loyalty I was having trouble getting the -10...real trouble....Anyway I tried the -5 and it didnt grow.I tried it a few times and it works! You DONT absoloutly need the -10 drop!So if your having probs with it and your at the week of the growth just go for any old loyalty drop and see.This will reduce the amount of times you have to reload!Yay!

 Hammerfall, I think I mentioned this earlier, but if I didn&#39;t, YOU&#39;RE RIGHT!  When your loyalty gets low, one loyalty &#40;fear or spoil&#41; will almost always be closer to zero than the other.  When you give the banana, one will hit 0 &#40;without getting the full effect of -10&#41;, and the other will lose 10.  This can give you numbers like -6, -7, -8, or -9 loyalty.  It also works if you get a -5 overall loyalty, but that means that the loyalty you have right then is all one kind or the other &#40;spoil or fear&#41;.  Hope that helps.  &#40;SI&#41;

 Yep I&#39;ve tested it.Any loyalty drop gives the extra week.After getting the -5 I started to get strange values from Banana&#39;s-2,-3,-4,-6 etc. <BR>My Pebbly has been at the week before the 2nd growth for 2yrs8m at present and I have simply watched for any loyalty drop...he&#39;s still small. <BR>Stats at present-415-524-637-543-505-302.Age-8yrs8m not yet in prime.BTW I just realised last night that you should save 2 times a week.Once after a succesful drill and once again after the banana has worked so you dont have to reload if the drill fails.I dont know if that has been mentioned but its a good idea...saves time. <BR>Thanx SI all I have to do now is recover the 120,000g this monster has cost me so far!
