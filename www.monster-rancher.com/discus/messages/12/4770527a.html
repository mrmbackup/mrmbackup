OK.  I know what happened here.  There is another force at work that I covered in the DP files.  Since the corrected orders for the Kitten and Mint match, I&#39;ll put the rankings of those two in one column, the baseline stat order of the Pixie in another.  Here is a table that illustrates what I&#39;m talking about. <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Rank</TD><TD>Mint/Kitten</TD><TD>Pixie baseline </TD></TR><TR><TD>1st</TD><TD>INT</TD><TD>INT </TD></TR><TR><TD>2nd</TD><TD>SPD</TD><TD>SKI </TD></TR><TR><TD>3rd</TD><TD>SKI</TD><TD>SPD </TD></TR><TR><TD>4th</TD><TD>POW</TD><TD>POW </TD></TR><TR><TD>5th</TD><TD>DEF</TD><TD>DEF </TD></TR><TR><TD>6th</TD><TD>LIF</TD><TD>LIF</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>As you can see, four of the stat rankings of the parents were aligned with that of the Pixie offspring.  Those stats were INT,POW,DEF,and LIF.  INT as SCT said turned out very well.  Why didn&#39;t POW, DEF, and LIF turn out so hot then, since they did align?  The answer is very simple, look at those stats in the parents, they were so low to begin with that the effect of the combining was negligible. <BR> <BR>The Kato, on the other hand, turned out very, very well.  Why?  Look at this ^_^ <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Rank</TD><TD>Mint/Kitten</TD><TD>Kato baseline </TD></TR><TR><TD>1st</TD><TD>INT</TD><TD>INT </TD></TR><TR><TD>2nd</TD><TD>SPD</TD><TD>SPD </TD></TR><TR><TD>3rd</TD><TD>SKI</TD><TD>SKI </TD></TR><TR><TD>4th</TD><TD>POW</TD><TD>DEF </TD></TR><TR><TD>5th</TD><TD>DEF</TD><TD>LIF </TD></TR><TR><TD>6th</TD><TD>LIF</TD><TD>POW</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Only 3 of the stats lined up, but the three that did were the MAJOR ones, so the carry-over effect is plainly illustrated.

 To summarize, in order to get the optimum effect for stat carryover, the corrected stat rankings of both of the parents must match the rankings of the baseline stats of the desired offspring as much as possible. <BR> <BR>Thus, it is entirely possible, though rare, to have Great combos that have no above average stats in ANY of the outcomes.  Keep this in mind.

 There is some weirdness going on here.  Attempted to align,as much as possible, the corrected stat orders of two monsters which, according to theory, CAN&#39;T be made into a Great combo, namely a Pixie and a Tiger. For the record, I had four out of the six stats aligned, yet I was only able to come up with an &#34;unsure&#34; combo.  I set the stats of the parents to that of the desired offspring, in this case, a Tiger. <BR> <BR>First sign that something was strange was when I was getting Mints with POW as their highest stat. <BR>When I finally got my Tiger, I fully expected to have SKI to be my highest stats, instead, it was POW!  Wha!? <BR> <BR>I then made the stat GAINS indentical,all 3&#39;s for the record &#40;so I wouldn&#39;t have to mess with more correcting craziness&#41; and then made the stat orders identical to the Tiger&#39;s baseline stat orders, this time, when I came up with the Tiger, everything went as expected. <BR> <BR>Apparently, there is another factor involved.  What could it be?

 I think I may have discovered a minor flaw in the theory.  After some experimenting with a Mocchi and a Ghost, I am being led to believe that the multiplier for the stat gains of one is NOT zero. <BR> <BR>I did a combining experiment with a Mocchi and a Ghost on the assumption that the stats with a gain of one would have a multiplier of zero.  I ran it through the lab and only got an &#34;unsure&#34; result, HOWEVER, when I redid the experiment, this time taking into account the possiblity the the stats with gains of 1 might have weight. I ended up with a great combo again. <BR> <BR>Obviously, the combining technique needs refining and it may be a little while yet before I can post an authoritative combining FAQ, but I AM making progress.

 He means that the multiplier for stat gains of 1 might be greater than the value of 0 that he has been using.

 I&#39;m even more confused. I did some more experimenting with the Mocchi-Ghost combination as well as with the Kitten-Mint pairing and it seem that the multiplier is indeed 0.  I have to review and look for flaws in my procedure.

 GOOD NEWS! <BR> <BR>Disregard my previous three posts!  The &#34;weirdness&#34; I described was of my own doing. Due to a miscalculation, the set some stats in my combining experiments too high.  After correcting the problems everything fell into place with my Mocchi-Ghost and Tiger-Pixie experiments.  Things keep looking better.  Could this be the magic bullet?

 So do the base line stats play any factor anymore? <BR> <BR>If they don&#39;t then those posts I made when this research began can be deleted because they are pretty much useless.

 Actually, if you have been reading closely mepersoner, baseline stats play a BIG role in combining. They play two important factors in combining. <BR> <BR>1.  When determining the order of the corrected stats, baseline stats are used to resolve ties.  &#40;e.g. Two scores of 999, which stat counts as the higher one?&#41; <BR> <BR>and <BR> <BR>2.  For optimum stat carryover, the corrected order of the stats of the parents must match the order of the BASELINE stats of the desired offspring as much as possible. <BR> <BR>Your work in the baseline stats is critical in helping people get the most out of their combos, so don&#39;t delete those posts.
