<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
In the light of organizing the raising/training tips in one easy to find strategy pile, I propose to all trainers out there to compile all of their training/raising related tips into one easy to find section. Please read previously submitted tips to make sure you don&#39;t add any duplicate posts. Now let the forum begin! :  <BR> <BR>&#42;I will borrow my brother Tonberi&#39;s thread on Stimulants for this article&#42;  <BR> <BR><B>Monster Nature:</B> A monster&#39;s nature affects what techniques it is able to learn as well as what in battle specials in gains. The current speculation here is that happy eyes signifies &#42;good&#42; techniques whereas evil eyes signify &#42;bad&#42; ones.  <BR> <BR><B>Good natured monsters receive the following in battle specials &#40;unsure&#41;:</B> Power - Activated when monster takes a severe amount of damage in one hit. Once activated, affected monster&#39;s power rating raises tenfold. Use this time to make a comeback.  <BR> <BR>Hurry - I have no idea what it does. It seems to be activated when time is running out.  <BR> <BR><B>Worst natured monsters gain the following in battle specials:</B> Anger - occurs when a bad natured monster takes damage. Once activated, anger speeds up guts regeneration, it bolsters the effectiveness of withering techniques, and it dramatically increases enemy chance to hit, so be careful  <BR> <BR>Ease - When the enemy misses your monster a set number of consecutive times, ease is activated. Once activated, enemy chance to hit decreases  <BR> <BR><B>Other in game specials:</B> Grit - Activated only if KO&#39;d. Gives you a second chance to pull a comeback. Power increases tenfold.  <BR> <BR>Unity - Color Pandoras. any ideas  <BR> <BR>Fight - Gaboos?  <BR> <BR>Guard - Golems. Reduces damage  <BR> <BR>Real - Jokers. Activated once the battle is pretty much over. Real boosts the Jokers stats, but once it wears off, the Joker&#39;s stats plummet...  <BR> <BR>When fighting an enemy, sometimes the best way to learn how to beat it is to actually use it, that way you will know what type of techniques are heavily damaging, accurate, withering, etc. So once you know what your enemy is capable of, you can devise a strategy that revolves around the enemy using weaker attacks.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve noticed that the enemy usually attacks once its guts is 45&#43;. anything below that, they will stall until they have enough in which the AI thinks is wise to attack with. So either you can wither constantly to keep them from attacking or you can use a strategy that has brought me decent success, which is the following.  <BR> <BR>Try to find enemy techniques that require tons of guts and not accurate at the same time and try to provoke the enemy into using that technique. I know, it still may connect, but its an easy way to force the enemy into wasting guts.  <BR> <BR>If the enemy has high skill, always find its weakest attack and stay there. High guts moves are usually VERY devastating, so its best that you stay in the range of the &#34;weaker&#34; moves.  <BR> <BR>Fight as much as you can, especially in C, B, or A class. Fighting often will not only add gold to your ranch&#39;s coffers, but its also an excellent way to train your monster. The bonuses gained from successful fights in the C, B, A classes are quite nice and they are an excellent way to round out your monsters since the bonuses don&#39;t seem to be affected by a monster&#39;s intrinsic attributes.  <BR> <BR>After realizing that the effects of the stimulant vitamins remained relatively constant &#40;i.e. a certain stat would always be boosted by a vitamin&#41; I decided to look into the issue on what stats were boosted by a stimulant and the amount it would then be augmented by. My results should be rather accurate as I have experimented and observed the results of the stimulants on multiple monsters, on multiple dates, and on multiple tourneys. My findings are as follows:  <BR> <BR>Nageel - Will bolster skill and defense attributes by 50%. In layman terms, a base skill rating of 300 will be raised to 450 for one battle once nageel is applied. The same would occur for defense. a base defense rating of 300 would be raised to 450.  <BR> <BR>Kasseitan - Utilizing this stimulant will augment your monster&#39;s power and speed attributes by 50%. Once again the example is as follows. If your base strength skill were 300, after using this supplement, it would rise to 450 for the duration of one tournament. The same example would occur for speed.  <BR> <BR>Teromeann - Unlike the previous two stimulants, this has a differing effect. Rather than temporarily improving two attributes by 50%, this stimulant bolsters the monster&#39;s power rating by 20%, its skill rating by 20%, and its speed by an astronomical 100%. See above examples on how to apply bonuses to your monster&#39;s stats.  <BR> <BR>Other notes: Nageel should be available around 1008 Kasseitan should be available around 1016 Teromeann for me is only available through an A Class tourney as a prize. Any information on its release date is welcome.  <BR> <BR>Teromeann seems to be ill-received by the intended recipient, not quite clear on what sort of negative &#40;other than the proposed life span reduction&#41; effect it imposes on the monster.  <BR> <BR>All stimulants should be applied on the week a rancher intends to fight.  <BR> <BR>By utilizing the stimulants and the information above, it may assist you with that extra boost that will make your monster a serious competitor in the higher classes.  <BR> <BR>Feel free to add stuff folks! Zoinks  <BR> <BR> <BR>-- Zoinks &#40;<A HREF="mailto:kboi513@icqmail.com">kboi513@icqmail.com</A>&#41;, October 18, 1999  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>very well said, zoinks  <BR> <BR>i remember on the old board dr jovis and i had a discussion about some lesser ranchers&#39; &#91;well, alright, me&#93; tendency to hit and hit and hit and wear down guts instead of waiting for the right time and saving your guts for the right hit.  <BR> <BR>mr2 has cured me of that. it is sheer suicide to come out swinging. as i get to know the enemies more, i try to make them use one of their lesser attacks before i even launch my first attack. for example, my whole strategy against goatrek is to goad him into trying his roll attack, which usually misses&#91;whew!&#93;. similarly, with thanatos, i try to get close - his close range attacks are impressively named but usually don&#39;t hurt as much as his longrange attacks, and often miss entirely. only after i have a decent guts advantage do i try to position myself for my best attacks.  <BR> <BR>of course, this means you need a monster with decent attributes on the lif/spd/def axis.  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, October 19, 1999.
