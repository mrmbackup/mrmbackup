ok, so we know the -10 gives a week of life, and the &#43;10 takes a week of Life. <BR> <BR>What about -9, -8, -7 etc, etc. <BR>I am creating this for testing.  I am raising a monster until the Very last week of life.  and seeing with the different &#34;-#&#34; to see what numbers actually work. <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Monster Fenrick</FONT>

ok, he WAS at 100 loyalty, but resting the last couple of weeks brings him down to 99 Loyalty. <BR>it is Dec Week 1, and he will Die Dec Week 2 If I rest. <BR>------------------------------------------------- <BR>Results: <BR>99 -&#62; MB -&#62; 94 = -5 in Loyalty = Monster Died <BR>99 -&#62; MB -&#62; 89 = -10 in Loyalty = Monster Lives <BR>------------------------------------------------- <BR>ok.. for the NEXT part of the test, with such High Loyalty i am only getting -5 or -10, so i am going to continue this method until Low Loyalty, when the numbers start breaking the Norm. <BR> <BR>------------------------------------------------- <BR>ok, the rest of this Data is me feeding MBs until he gets to Low Loyalty... now I make a strange discovery: <BR> <BR>24 -&#62; MB -&#62; 19 = -5 in Loyalty = Monster Lived!! <BR>19 -&#62; MB -&#62; 14 = -5 in Loyalty = Monster Lived!! <BR>17 -&#62; MB -&#62; 12 = -5 in Loyalty = Monster Lived!! <BR>15 -&#62; MB -&#62; 09 = <FONT COLOR="ff0000">-6</FONT> in Loyalty = Monster Lived!! <BR>11 -&#62; MB -&#62; 06 = -5 in Loyalty = Monster Lived!! <BR>09 -&#62; MB -&#62; 04 = -5 in Loyalty = Monster Lived!! <BR>05 -&#62; MB -&#62; 0 = -5 in Loyalty = Monster Lived!! <BR>04 -&#62; MB -&#62; 0 = -4 in Loyalty = Monster Lived!! <BR>02 -&#62; MB -&#62; 0 = -2 in Loyalty = Monster Lived!! <BR>0 -&#62; MB -&#62; 0 = -0 in Loyalty = Monster Lived!!

 Ok.. so when does the change occur from -10 to gain a week of life ro -5 to gain a week of life? <BR>&#40;starting back over at 100 and testing Every Loyalty Drop of -5 until it gets me the &#43;1 week of Life&#41;

Hours have gone by.  So Far from Loyalty 100 down to Loyalty 38 i can get only a -10 when the Bananas Drop the Loyalty. <BR> <BR>However.. When at Loyalty 32 I got a -9. <BR>32 -&#62; MB -&#62; 23 = <FONT COLOR="ff0000">-9</FONT> in Loyalty = Monster Lived!! <BR> <BR>This brings me down to 23 Loyalty, which was proven only needs a -5 to gain the week of life. <BR>Conclusion This Far: Loyalty about 30 or less requires only the -5 to -10 for 1 week of lifespan.  Any other Participation would be Greatly Appreciated! <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Monster Fenrick</FONT>

 My 7 year 5 months Zuum had 47 loyalty when I tried this.  He only got a -1, -6, &#43;3, and &#43;9.  After all of them he didn&#39;t live, but died.  It could have something to do with high loyalty, or being spoiled.  It might not work for above 30.
