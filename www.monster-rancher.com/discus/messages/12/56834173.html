Here&#39;s what I do before prime.  This is pretty much <BR>Mepersoner&#39;s Method. <BR> <BR> <BR>Drills HD LD HD LD  <BR>Items: NO ML NO ML  <BR> <BR> <BR>This only works with monsters that like tablets, or a <BR>HAD monster who is either ok, or likes tablets. If <BR>training with my method, I suggest that you train the <BR>worst stats first, and the best ones during prime <BR>&#40;while using the method&#41;. <BR> <BR> <BR>When going on an errantry, I always go on the first <BR>week of the month, after feeding it a NO. Afterwords I <BR>go...  <BR> <BR> <BR>RT HD LD HD TB HD LD HD LD TB  <BR>NO MB NO ML &#40;&#41; NO ML NO ML &#40;&#41;  <BR> <BR> <BR>Then on with the normal schedule.  <BR> <BR> <BR>For battles, I only battle on weeks 2 and 4, seeing as <BR>they work this way, and how all the important battles <BR>&#40;gold, platina, official, legend, big 4, sculpture, <BR>and etc.&#41; fall on these weeks. I feed a MB instead of <BR>a ML before the battle. After a battle, there are two <BR>methods. The first one is if the battle is on week 4, <BR>the second is if the battle is on week 2.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Week 4 battle:  <BR>LD LD HD LD TB  <BR>NO NO ML NO &#40;&#41;  <BR> <BR> <BR>Week 2 battle:  <BR>LD HD TB HD LD HD LD TB  <BR>NO NO &#40;&#41; NO ML NO ML &#40;&#41;  <BR> <BR> <BR>With both the errantry, and the battle, you need to go <BR>all the way through to the end of what I posted before <BR>going on another errantry, or another battle.  <BR> <BR> <BR>This method is intended for the longest lifespan <BR>possible, you lose no life unless going to a battle or <BR>errantry, but the losses are minimal. Also, the <BR>errantry method works under the worst conditions of <BR>sleep &#40;getting the least fatigue and stress taken <BR>away&#41; ONLY IF you have either a fire stone, or an ice <BR>block.  <BR> <BR> <BR>That is a little bit restrictive, so if you have a <BR>nuetral to tablets monster and he isn&#39;t a HAD, then, <BR>well, I&#39;ll go back to my charts and work on it.  <BR> <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t go on any battles or errantries while on <BR>the Living Forever method.  Just delay them until <BR>you&#39;re maxxed or very close to being maxxed.  Then go <BR>off, finish up the stats and do some battles and <BR>errantries while getting loyalty up &#40;seeing as of how <BR>it&#39;ll be at 0 when you go off the method&#41;.  After a <BR>battle, I&#39;d just give them a NO and rest if it&#39;s <BR>needed &#40;such as getting a KO&#41;.  But for the <BR>errantries, I&#39;d give them a ML, rest them and give <BR>them a NO.  After you&#39;re maxxed, just do that and then <BR>freeze your monster until you want them to do <BR>something.  I suggest that you do errantries on the <BR>1st week of the month &#40;because you&#39;ve just fed it <BR>tablets&#41;. <BR> <BR><B>Ok, the method is as follows.</B> <BR> <BR> <BR>Week 2 RT MB  <BR>Week 3 LD MB  <BR>Week 4 HD MB  <BR>Tablets  <BR>Week 1 LD MB  <BR>Week 2 RT MB  <BR>Week 3 LD MB  <BR>Week 4 HD MB  <BR>Tablets  <BR>And etc. <BR> <BR> <BR>Now that works with any monster that is nuetral to or <BR>likes tablets.  It does cost 1100 a month, and the <BR>only way to get the extra week of life span is if your <BR>loyalty goes down 10.  But since loyalty is made from <BR>2 separate things &#40;fear and spoil&#41; one might hit 0 <BR>before the other one.  This means that you can get -9, <BR>8, 7, 6, and etc.  Once you&#39;re down to 0 loyalty, and <BR>give your monster a banana, you will get the extra <BR>week if it stays at 0.  For the best stat gains, use <BR>this method when the monster is in the first week of <BR>prime &#40;right after their second growth&#41;.  When going <BR>on expeditions, I suggest going on week 3 because it&#39;s <BR>right after you&#39;ve rested.  Then, for battles, well, <BR>that depends on the week you&#39;re going.  The important <BR>battles tend to fall on weeks 2 and 4, so I&#39;ll look at <BR>my fatigue chart and check out what to do there.  I&#39;ll <BR>give you that info in a bit... is there anything not <BR>very clear? anything I need to explain a bit more?  It <BR>is the summary right?  because I could add a bunch of <BR>banana-technology stuff, of whatever.

 Hehe, that is basically what I did...but when you take them off the method and want them to do battles right away, DON&#39;T get them off the method when they are maxed.  I say wait till they are about at level 18 or 19 for a few stats, and then use that to train and get the loyalty up, while waiting for the battles...better than just going to a tourney with 0 loyalty. &#42;grumbles&#42;

 It also works for other monsters as well SI. Mepersoner has posted this method and someone else may have already done so but I did the calculations for it a while back, while looking at various methods and calculating the lifespan index but it does work best with monsters that have the HAD effect because of the extra effect of the NO. But posted here is the workings for any normal monster.  <BR> <BR>Week 1 <BR>HD  15  12  = 15 12 = 39 <BR>Week 2 <BR>ML   0 -1/2 = 15  6 = 27  <BR>LD  10   5  = 25 11 = 47  <BR>Week 3 <BR>NO -25   0  =  0 11 = 22  <BR>HD  15  12  = 15 23 = 61  <BR>Week 3 <BR>ML   0 -1/2 = 15 12 = 39  <BR>LD  10   5  = 25 17 = 59  <BR> <BR>TB   0 -15  = 25  2 = 29  <BR> <BR>Week 1 <BR>NO -25   0  =  0  2 = 4  <BR>HD  15  12  = 15 14 = 43  <BR>Week 2 <BR>ML   0 -1/2 = 15  7 = 29  <BR>LD  10   5  = 25 12 = 49  <BR>Week 3 <BR>NO -25   0  =  0 12 = 24  <BR>HD  15  12  = 15 24 = 63  <BR>Week 4 <BR>ML   0 -1/2 = 15 12 = 39  <BR>LD  10   5  = 25 17 = 59  <BR> <BR>Since results of Nevistars research says as long as LI is under 70 you wont get a lifespan loss. So as you can see, the first part of the method should work with any monster other than those with HAD effect as long as its not affected by responses to cheating or failure and succeeds.  <BR> <BR>Looking at the MB part of it and I see the change of the HD placement. This works out better because under the other method of HD,RT,LD,LD. the lifespan index would be at 6 after the rest but now after the rest, it would be at 0. &#40;not that it would make any difference anyway since there is no lifespan loss&#41;

 Yeah, hey guys... LONG time no see.  Thanks for posting the numbers Unpleasant Desire! I did them before, and I knew it worked, but I just really didn&#39;t want to mess with them.  Strunks, I had that in my summary, but I think it didn&#39;t get on, oh well.  Yeah, I would go off the method and finish them off while getting their loyalty up.  You might think about using apple cakes and smoked snakes as well.  Now I&#39;ve got to get caught up on everything I missed...  &#40;SI&#41;
