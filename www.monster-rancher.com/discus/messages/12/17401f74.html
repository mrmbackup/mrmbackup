Ever wonder what your effect your actions and the items have on your monster?  With the help of a Gameshark Pro and Xianaix&#39;s code guide, I located the memory locations that govern your monster&#39;s fatigue, stress, loyalty, form and nature.  Using these tools an info, I have begun a project to discover just exactly what effect certains actions and items have on a monster. <BR> <BR>Before beginning, I&#39;ll explain some things about the values themselves. <BR> <BR>STRESS AND FATIGUE <BR> <BR>Stress and Fatigue are rated on a scale of 0 - 100. 0 = no stress/fatigue  100 = max stress/fatigue.  This value is altered by items that you give your monster, your actions while raising the monster, stable size, and certain items in your possession.  Here are some scales to illustrate. <BR> <BR>Stress <BR> <BR>0 &#40;no stress&#41; -&#40;===================&#41;-100 &#40;runaway&#41; <BR> <BR>Fatigue <BR> <BR>0 &#40;very well&#41; -&#40;===================&#41;-100 &#40;sickness&#41; <BR> <BR>The closer the stress and fatigue values are to the high end of the spectrum, the greater the danger of the monster running away/getting sick. <BR> <BR>LOYALTY AND RAISING STYLE <BR> <BR>Loyalty in Monster Rancher 2 is actually determined by two values, Spoil and Fear.  Both of these values are rated from 0 - 100 and loyalty is calculated by determining the average of these two values.  Raising style is also influenced by these values.  The relationship of these two values determine your raising style, as shown by this chart. <BR> <BR>Spoil much greater than Fear = Doting <BR>Spoil somewhat greater than Fear = Fond <BR>Spoil slightly greater than Fear = Soft <BR>Spoil and Fear are roughly equal = Even <BR>Fear slightly greater than Spoil = Strict <BR>Fear somewhat greater than Spoil = Harsh <BR>Fear much greater than Spoil = Spartan <BR> <BR>Note that this dual loyalty system is why trainers that spoil their monsters have trouble getting their monster&#39;s loyalty much beyond 50. <BR> <BR>FORM <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know much yet on how form affect your monster&#39;s performance &#40; I&#39;ll do some experiments on this in the future&#41;,  but I do know that Form is rated on a scale of -100 to &#43;100,  illustrated here. <BR> <BR>&#40;-100,  Skinny&#41;-&#40;======&#40;0,  Normal&#41;========&#41;-&#40;&#43;100, Plump&#41; <BR> <BR>NATURE <BR> <BR>The monster&#39;s nature is also rated on a scale form -100 to &#43;100, shown here. <BR> <BR>&#40;-100, Worst&#41;-&#40;=========&#40;0, Neutral&#41;===========&#41;-&#40;&#43;100, Best&#41; <BR> <BR>This value, naturally, determines your monster&#39;s general attitude. <BR> <BR>Well, now to the list... <BR> <BR>ITEMS <BR> <BR>Using the info above, this list shows the effects of various items on your monster.  <BR> <BR>Mango   -10 Fatigue, &#43;1 Form, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear <BR>Candy  -  -2 Stress, &#43;10 Form, &#43;1 Spoil <BR>Smoked Snake  -  -10 Spoil, &#43;20 Fear, -10 Form <BR>Apple Cake  - &#43;10 Spoil, -5 Fear, &#43;10 Form <BR>Mint Leaf  - Stress reduced by 50%, -5 Form, -2 Spoil <BR>Powder  - &#43;5 Fatigue, -24 Form <BR>Sweet Jelly  -  &#43;5 Form, -33 &#40;?&#41;&#42; <BR>Sour Jelly   - &#43;5 Form, &#43;33 &#40;?&#41; &#42; <BR>Nuts Oil  -  -28 Fatigue, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear <BR>Star Prune  -  &#43;20 Fame, &#43;5 Spoil, &#43;1 Form <BR>Half Eaten  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Irritator  -  &#43;5 Fatigue,  &#43;15 Stress, -1 Form <BR>Griever  -  &#43;10 Fatigue, Stress reduced by 40%, -1 Form <BR>Bay Shrimp  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Incense  -  -1 Stress <BR>Shoes  -  -1 Stress <BR>Rice Cracker  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Olive Oil  -  -1 Stress, &#43;1 Form <BR>Kaleidoscope  -  -1 Stress <BR>Torles Water  -  -1 Stress <BR>Perfume  -  -1 Stress <BR>Stick  -  -1 Stress <BR>Bone  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Perfume Oil  -  -2 Stress, &#43;5 Form <BR>Wool Ball  -  -1 Stress <BR>Cedar Log  -  -1 Stress <BR>Pile of Meat  -  &#43;12 Form <BR>Soil  -  -1 Stress <BR>Rock Candy  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Dummy  -  -1 Stress <BR>Ice of Papas  -  -1 Stress <BR>Grease  -  -1 Stress <BR>Parepare Tea  -  -1 Stress, &#43;1 Form <BR>Match  -  -1 Stress <BR>Toothpick  -  -1 Stress <BR>Playmate  -  -1 Stress <BR>Polish  -  -1 Stress <BR>Silk Cloth  -  -1 Stress <BR>Disc Dish  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Gramophone  -  -1 Stress <BR>Steamed Bun  -  &#43;2 Form <BR>Razor Blade  -  -1 Stress <BR>Ice Candy  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Sun Lamp  -  -1 Stress <BR>Silk Hat  -  -1 Stress <BR>Half Cake  -  &#43;5 Spoil, -2 Fear, &#43;5 Form <BR>Shaved Ice  -  -12 Stress, &#43;1 Form <BR>Sweet Potato  -  -5 Stress, &#43;10 Form <BR>Colart Tea  -  -5 Stress, &#43;5 Form <BR>Galoe Nut  -  -1 Form <BR>Stick of Ice  -  -1 Stress <BR>Clay Doll  -  -1 Stress <BR>Mock Nut  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Fish Bone  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Colt&#39;s Cake  -  &#43;15 Form <BR>Gold Peach - &#43;50 weeks lifespan <BR>Silver Peach - &#43;25 weeks lifespan <BR> <BR>Larox: &#43;10 Pow, &#43;10 Def, -10 Lif. -4 weeks lifespan total <BR>Manseitan: &#43;10 Lif, &#43;10 Ski, -10 Spd. -5 weeks lifespan total <BR>Troron: &#43;10 Pow, &#43;5 Ski. -10 weeks lifespan <BR>Paradoxine: &#43;30 Pow, &#43;30 Ski, -10% Spd, -10% Def. -18 weeks lifespan <BR>Nageel: &#43;50% Ski, &#43;50% Def. -20 weeks lifespan &#40;effects for one battle&#41; <BR>Kasseitan: &#43;50% Pow, &#43;50% Spd. -20 weeks lifespan &#40;effects for one battle&#41; <BR>Teromeann: &#43;50% Pow, &#43;100% Spd. -20 weeks lifespan &#40;effects for one battle&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;  -  This is weird,  while examines the effects of these items,  I found that, contrary to popular belief,  Sweet and Sour Jellies do NOT directly affect the monster&#39;s nature.  Instead, I found that it influenced ANOTHER value that I didn&#39;t know existed until I started this project.  I don&#39;t know exacly what it does, but what I do know that Sweet Jellies drop this value by 33,  while Sour Jellies raise it by 33.  Any ideas as to this value might represent? <BR><CENTER>&#42;&#42;&#42;</CENTER> <BR><B><FONT SIZE="+1">The HAD effect courtesy of Nevistar</FONT></B> <BR>Nuts Oil:  <BR> <BR>-28 Fatigue  <BR>-1/5 current Stress &#91;round down&#93; in monsters with Durahan,Henger, or ArrowHead main and/or subs <BR> <BR>This info is from <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Maze/6761/" TARGET="_blank">Nevistar&#39;s</A> site. <BR><CENTER>&#42;&#42;&#42;</CENTER> <BR> This list is not complete but I&#39;ll be adding to this as I gather more info.

This is meant to be a supplement to my item effect list.  Refer to it to find out what the numbers mean. I have broken down the list to include what each of the foods do when liked, disliked or neutral.  So here we go, here&#39;s what the Foods do: <BR> <BR>Potato: <BR>   Liked: &#43;1 Spoil, -1 Fear, -1 Form <BR>   Neutral: &#43;4 Stress, -4 Spoil, &#43;3 Fear, -1 Form <BR>   Disliked: &#43;16 Stress, -10 Spoil, &#43;4 Fear, -1 Form <BR> <BR>Milk: <BR>   Liked: -3 Stress, &#43;3 Spoil, &#43;1 Form <BR>   Neutral: -2 Stress, &#43;1 Spoil, -1 Fear, &#43;1 Form <BR>   Disliked: &#43;4 Stress, -4 Spoil, -4 Fear, &#43;1 Form <BR> <BR>Fish: <BR>   Liked: -6 Stress, &#43;3 Spoil, &#43;2 Form <BR>   Neutral: -3 Stress, &#43;2 Spoil, &#43;2 Form <BR>   Disliked: &#43;2 Stress, -2 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear, &#43;2 Form <BR> <BR>Cup Jelly: <BR>   Liked: -7 Stress, &#43;1 Spoil, -3 Form <BR>   Neutral: -5 Stress, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear, -3 Form <BR>   Disliked: &#43;1 Stress, -1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear, -3 Form <BR> <BR>Meat: <BR>   Liked: -8 Stress, &#43;5 Spoil, &#43;5 Form <BR>   Neutral: -6 Stress, &#43;4 Spoil, &#43;6 Form <BR>   Disliked: &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear &#43;6 Form <BR> <BR>Tablets: <BR>   Liked: -15 Stress, &#43;3 Spoil, &#43;2 Fear, &#43;3 Form <BR>   Neutral: -13 Stress, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;2 Fear, &#43;3 Form <BR>   Disliked: -10 Stress, -1 Spoil, &#43;2 Fear, &#43;2 Form <BR> <BR>Normal Rest - reduces 33-47 points of Fatigue and 5-10 points of Stress &#40;without Lump Of Ice or Fire Stone&#41; <BR> <BR>In a case where the monsters like or dislike changes to that of the trainer, the like/dislike, if it was originally a food, reverts to the neutral value.  <BR> <BR>Hopefully this can help you make decisions on what to feed your monsters.  As you can see, what you feed it can make a big difference in your monster&#39;s welfare. <BR> <BR><CENTER>&#42;&#42;&#42;</CENTER> <BR> <BR><B>Items used in Combination:</B> <BR>Crab&#39;s Claw: &#43;50 Skill &#43;50 Defense <BR>Taurus Horn: increases chance of getting a Centaur &#40;no effect when held in inventory&#41; <BR>Old Sheath: -50 Defense &#40;this is not a typo&#41; <BR>Disc Chips: see the separate chart in the FAQ <BR>Big Footprints: &#43; 20 Skill &#43;20 Def, no effect if held <BR> <BR>Gold, Pure Platina, Silver, Emerald, Diamond and Meteorite have no effect, sell them for cash. <BR> <BR>Good Luck! <BR><B>Note on items &amp; Pocketstation:</B> <BR>The following items are connected to the Pocketstation mini-game and cannot be accessed without a cheat device: <BR> <BR>Sweet Potato <BR>Shaved Ice <BR>Half Cake <BR>Gold Medal <BR>Silver Medal <BR>Medallion <BR>Music Box <BR> <BR>DNA Capsules <BR> <BR><B>-Dark Phoenix</B>
