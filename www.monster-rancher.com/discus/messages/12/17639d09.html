I don&#39;t have the stats with me right now, &#40;I&#39;ll  <BR>get them to you later&#41; but I have proof that Jells  <BR>can be both Power based or Intellegence based.   <BR> <BR>First, is there anybody who decided to raise a POW  <BR>Jell? Not many.  They are mostly Intellegence  <BR>creatures, at least how I used them.  On the  <BR>Defense Errantry there are mostly INT based moves,  <BR>correct?  So, they have more INT then POW moves.   <BR>Now, I experimented with a POW AND INT Jells, both  <BR>Muddy.  Here are the results: <BR> <BR>1&#41;INT-based:Dirty was trained on another file  <BR>&#40;same game though&#41; as a test monster.  He beat S  <BR>Class with pretty bad stats, and I used a DRUG, so  <BR>I considered him to be S Class material, maybe  <BR>even A Class. <BR> <BR>2&#41;POW--based:Mudd is the monster that I will keep.   <BR>he BEAT S <I>without drugs, not losing a single  <BR>battle</I>.  I&#39;ll get you his stats later. I hope  <BR>I won&#39;t be embarassed and find out that most  <BR>people have been training in Power?   <BR> <BR>Mudd lived to be five years ten months, and I was  <BR>going to enter him in the World Monster&#39;s Cup, but  <BR>the week before I gave him a Nuts Oil and saved,  <BR>then the week of the Cup he died, so I was faced  <BR>with a decision:save him and get a Mock, or  <BR>combine him with another POW based Jell and make a  <BR>possible champion.  Remember, he is a first  <BR>generation monster.   <BR> <BR>Does anybody

 Yep, Jells are very balanced in terms of their attacks.  A lot depends on your fighting style and how high you build your attack stats -- and with some of the raising styles floating around, just about any monster can get its attack stats up to the heights... <BR> <BR>POW-Jells get some nice low-cost moves.  Jell Top &#40;D/S/E/E for 17&#41; is VERY nice -- compare that to a Pixie&#39;s Lightning &#40;D/A/E/E for 25&#41;, and I know I used THAT out the wazoo when winning with my Pixies.  Spiked Top &#40;C/A/E/D for 28&#41;, Two Whips &#40;C/A/D/- for 22&#41;, Pierce &#40;C/C/-/E for 21&#41;, Whip &#40;D/A/E/- for 14&#41; and particularly Suffocation &#40;B/C/E/B for 24&#41; are all very efficient, plus you get Bloodsuction as a low-% lifedrainer.  Jell Cube is useless, but you can&#39;t have everything... <BR> <BR>What you have there is a perfect chip-away monster; focus on POW and SKI and it&#39;ll be able to hit almost anyone reliably and do substantial damage with every shot, from three different ranges.  A Muddy Jell or Wall Mimic could ROCK if raised correctly. <BR> <BR>INT-Jells, on the other hand, are stuck at range &#40;then again, so is a Phoenix, and nobody complains about THEM&#41;.  You&#39;re short on moves for quite some time &#40;the low-hit% Cannon and Slingshot, plus Beam Gun&#41; until you unlock Beam Cannon, which can make some intermediate battles interesting.  Even at high levels, you&#39;re going to be relying on very high-Guts moves &#40;Jell Copter, Beam Cannon, Gatling Gun&#41; which are GREAT -- unless they miss.  ;&#41; <BR> <BR>              jeff.  who prefers slow-but-sure to massive-and-flashy, personally...

 i know i always raised my jells in int; and its good to hear the other side.  their stat gain pattern leans toward acquisition of int, but not as pronounced as some other monsters.

 Well, it also has to do with range of techniques. Very much like phoenix&#39;s. Back = Int. Front = Pow.

 But a Phoenix is useless in Power, because it only  <BR>has three moves.  HC--WT points out some good  <BR>moves, but you missed one!  Jell Press was  <BR>critical in the A and it knocked out everybody in  <BR>S in just two hits for a very good attack %,  <BR>whearas Jell Top with an even better attack %, but  <BR>a very weak hit is laid upon it. <BR> <BR>To tell you the truth, I prefer power based Jells,  <BR>and I am going to combine it with a Rocky Fur  <BR>&#40;Hare/Golem&#41; once I&#39;m done with it and hopefully  <BR>get a wall Mimic, which is the only Jell I haven&#39;t  <BR>gotten except Noble and Metal  <BR>Jell........

 I didn&#39;t miss it, I just don&#39;t like it that much.  ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Jell Press is C/A/E/E for 30.  <BR>Two Whips is C/A/D/- for 22. <BR> <BR>The mild Sharpness advantage is there for Jell Press, but with the mediocre Jell Guts regeneration, I&#39;d go with the Two Whips from the same range for the same damage and hit %.  Or Suffocation &#40;B/C/E/B for 24&#41;, with sufficient Skill to make it hit. <BR> <BR>Furthermore, look at Spiked Top: C/A/E/D for 28.  It&#39;s actually a BETTER attack than Jell Press for slightly less Guts!

 Long ago, I raised a Wall Mimmick named Rockslide.  I went for pow, int, and def, and maxed them out with good skill and life.  Suffocation was my favorite tech. for Rockslide, BTW.  Both intelligence and power will raise close to evenly, and with both, plus the added defense bonus of the Jell, you can&#39;t lose!  I also agree that Spiked Top is a good technique.  Just thought I&#39;d throw in a few cents, gang.

 Bloodsuction and Jell Copter whoop the @$$  <BR>of the 3 Cubes attack, but it&#39;s still pretty good.
