 Ever since my Colorpandora has been in the high numbers in his stats, even if he&#39;s still in his prime, the Failure rate of Drills has shot up to numbers like the Infancy stage. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t recall Level 3 Hard Drills giving this much failure rates in the previous time I raised my Corone &#40;Worm/Hare&#41;... <BR> <BR>The only thing I can rule out is that Level 3 Hard Drills actually have a really low Success rate, or being 100% Plump might actually have something to do with it &#40;though if the main subforum is to be taken into account then I don&#39;t think Form has anything to do with Drill Success... but I could swear this was happening even with Level 2 Meditate, but only when I found out that my CP&#39;s Form reached 100&#41;

 I noticed this frequently when I first started to understand the game and get the higher numbers, every time I hit the 3 star drill my monster would start to fail for seemingly no reason when it hadn&#39;t since its first two stages of life. I never really thought that it would just be set in stone that once you hit around 700 in a stat it suddenly takes about 5 resets on average if you want to keep raising it, and after reading a thread somewhere in the combining section &#40;Name escapes me now :&#124; &#41; that said if you get a baby which starts with stats in the 400s then it&#39;ll struggle with the 2 star drills I thought it might be to do with age. I was never really good enough to test this as every time I raised a monster up to 700s it would be well beyond prime so I never really knew until I raised my Wracky just recently. From what I gathered there: <BR> <BR>-During prime at 0 loyalty &#40;through bananas&#41; the fail rate was the same as infancy, light drills with 2 stars were still consistently fails <BR> <BR>-During prime at 100 Loyalty any stats he didn&#39;t get terrible gains in would succeed consistently, unfortunately due to his only having 2 stats with a gain&#62;1 with a HD attached to them doesn&#39;t really narrow this down too well. One other thing I noticed was that swim was by far the most consistent for failures, the swim bug doesn&#39;t make the fail rate the same as that of life, just the stat gain <BR> <BR>-Once he got into the latter stages of life he would begin to consistently fail like all my other monsters <BR> <BR>The RNG may have just been screwing with me, I hated the consistent resets and just used LDs and battles to raise stats for the most part once I hit 700s so I can only have done about 50 HDs total at this point, but basically from what I&#39;ve seen in order to do the 3 star drills you want to be in prime and doing the drills your monster is good at.

 But my CP was definitely in its prime when he was getting those consistent failures. <BR> <BR>I did notice it was the 3-star HDs giving that problem though...

 It&#39;s the 3 star HDs, they have a higher failure rate. I don&#39;t think we talk about it on the site, but, it&#39;s definitely a surprise when you get far enough in the game to think you&#39;ve got smooth sailing.
