 well, thanatos and prometheus originated in greek mythology. the greeks have been notoriously lax about retaining their intellectual property rights; that is why the names are so appealing to use!

 I think Prometheus is one of name most widely used in video games, comic books, science fiction, etc... I can think of at least 3 other characters named Prometheus right off the bat.

 Nice stuff!  Here are a few more: <BR> <BR> 037. Gidras &#40;Dragon/Metalner&#41;: Possible alternate spelling of &#34;Gidrah&#34; - also called &#34;Monster X&#34; in Western translations - who was a dragonlike monster from another world and a foe of Godzilla in a number of the KoM&#39;s movies.  I&#39;m guessing this is a reference to this breed&#39;s Metalner blood. <BR> 042. Dragoon &#40;Centaur/Dragon&#41;: Clever play on words, as a dragoon was a type of horse soldier who frequently was trained in the use of close weapons, much like the centaur&#39;s spear in MR2 <BR> 057. Bethelgeus &#40;Beaclon/Dragon&#41;: Misspelling of &#39;Betelgeuse&#39;, a bright star in Orion. <BR> 095. Dagon &#40;Golem/Arrowhead&#41;: H.P. Lovecraft also used this name to refer to a terrifying sea monster which is mentioned in several of his stories &#40;and appears personally in one&#41;. <BR> 103. Titan &#40;Golem/Suezo&#41;: In Greek mythology, a powerful and immortal race who ruled before the Gods and were overthrown by them. <BR> 109. Magna &#40;Golem/Worm&#41;: Latin, meaning great or excellent. <BR> 137. Lorica &#40;Durahan/Arrowhead&#41;: Latin again, meaning &#34;armor&#34;.  The typical Roman Legionaire wore a type of plate armor called &#34;lorica segmentata&#34;. <BR> 227. Gigalon &#40;Zilla/Jell&#41;: Similar to &#34;Megalon&#34;, another monster from Godzilla movies, but presumably even stonger &#40;since &#34;giga&#34; is superior to &#34;mega&#34;&#41; <BR> 271. Skull Capped &#40;Jill/Joker&#41;: A skull cap is a small round hat that covers only the very crown of the head, similar to the yarmulke worn by men who are Orthodox Jewish. <BR> 272. Pithecan &#40;Jill/???&#41;: Misspelling of &#34;Pithcairn&#34;.  Taken from &#34;Pithcairn Man&#34;, one of the anthropological discoveries which helped trace the evolution of man. <BR> 323. Ebony &#40;Mock/Joker&#41;: This is not only a type of &#40;very!&#41; hardwood tree, but also means utterly black in color.  I love double meanings!

 Dodongo is also in both the Zelda games on  <BR>the 64... and since it&#39;s colored similarly to the  <BR>Dodongo in the first Zelda game, I&#39;m inclined  <BR>to think they come from the same idea, if not  <BR>both from a mythology in the mideast  <BR>somewhere... <BR> <BR>As for some of the other ones &#40;i.e. Durahan is  <BR>similar to Dullahan, and Oscerot similar to  <BR>Ocelot&#41;, there is one important thing to  <BR>remember about the Japanese language, in  <BR>that it has no &#34;L&#34; sound.

 A few other ones I&#39;ll take a stab at: <BR> <BR>&#42;Selketo &#40;Arrowhead/Joker&#41;: Perhaps derived from &#34;skeleton&#34;? <BR> <BR>&#42;Renocraft &#40;Arrowhead/Henger&#41;: A few different theories my friends have on this one; some say it&#39;s named because it looks like a desert-dweller, and Reno &#40;Nevada&#41; is located in the middle of a desert.  Another says that some early space or sea exploration vehicles &#40;which this would resemble&#41; were either named Renocraft or were manufactured in Nevada&#39;s capital.  I wouldn&#39;t place bets on either of these, though. <BR> <BR>&#42;Ultrarl &#40;Bajarl/???&#41;: Looks like the campy old B-movie action star Ultra Man, who has fought off his share of giant, Power Ranger-esque monsters &#40;or rather, the Rangers copied him&#41; and destroyed Tokyo several times over in the process. <BR> <BR>&#42;Higante &#40;Baku/Golem&#41;: If said out load, it sounds like the Spanish word for &#34;gigantic.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42;Celious &#40;Centaur/Tiger&#41;: So many other names in the series are derived from stars, this shouldn&#39;t be too hard.  Revise the spelling, correct for bad translation, and you get &#34;Sirius,&#34; which I believe is known as the &#34;Dog Star&#34;? <BR> <BR>&#42;Tram &#40;ColorPandora/???&#41;: European slang-term for a subway. <BR> <BR>&#42;Angolmor &#40;Golem/Joker&#41;: I believe &#34;Angol Moa&#34; is some sort of vengeful volcano god in Hawaiian lore.  Eagle Fierce, could you check on this?  I know I&#39;ve heard the name before. <BR> <BR>&#42;Forward &#40;Golem/???&#41;: For those foreign to the American sport of Football &#40;not to be confused with what the rest of the world calls football, which we call soccer&#41;, the Forward is one of the star positions of the team.  Someone who knows more about sports could give more technical details.  &#40;And yes, I felt the need to say this because I know a good chunk of our traffic on the board is international.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;Pong-pong &#40;Jill/Pixie&#41;: The name of some famous gorilla back a few decades ago.  I think it was a present from the Chinese, along with the pandas Ling-ling and Hsing-hsing. <BR> <BR>&#42;Citronie &#40;Kato/Suezo&#41;: Probably derived from citrus, the healthy little vitamin C found in fruits like lemons. <BR> <BR>&#42;Nyankoro &#40;Mocchi/Kato&#41;: &#34;Nyan&#34; is Japanese for &#34;Miaow.&#34;  In fact, the Mew monster was called Nya in the first Monster Rancher. <BR> <BR>&#42;Baum Kuchen &#40;Niton/Mock&#41;: A German pastry that resembles a slice of log. <BR> <BR>&#42;Unico &#40;Pixie/Centuar&#41;: Look at it.  It looks like a Unicorn. <BR> <BR>Janna &#40;Pixie/Durahan&#41;: Possibly derived from Joan D&#39;Arc, a 14-year-old girl who led the French army against the British with visions and advice she claimed to receive from angels.  She was captured by the British and burned at the stake for heresy, then received Sainthood from the Catholic Church. <BR> <BR>Lilim &#40;Pixie/Joker&#41;: Probably comes from Lilith, a name that shows up all over the place in videogames &#40;so I don&#39;t know where it comes from, outside of being Celtic in origin&#41;, but it always refers to an evil woman or female monster. <BR> <BR>Siren &#40;Undine/Joker&#41;: Evil monsters that would lure sailors to their deaths in Greek mythology using their hypnotic voices.  They appear in the Iliad, among other things.

 Actually, as to &#34;Lilith,&#34; the place I&#39;ve heard that it comes from is from religion &#40;not sure if it&#39;s Judaism, Christianity, or both&#41;. Supposedly, in some versions of the story, Eve wasn&#39;t Adam&#39;s first wife. His first wife was Lilith, but because she was too proud and not obediant to Adam, etc., she ended up leaving the Garden &#40;and Eve was later made as Adam&#39;s consort&#41;, and Lilith then went on to take demons as her consorts and became the mother of demons. <BR> <BR>Or something like that.

 Actually, I know that legend well, though not certain whether to believe it or not.  The way that I heard it was that Lilith was originally Lucifer&#39;s partner, but God ordered him to give her up for Adam.  Lilith was a 100% rebellious feminist and God disapproved of it.  Lilith left Adam in disobedience and was trailed by three of God&#39;s highest Archangels.  They warned her that she unless she returned they were going to use some sort of Holy seal on her.  She still refused to go, and the seal was used to bind her to the realm.  The angels thought they&#39;d done their job, but she became the first Succubus, and fed off the souls of the young children born.  Because of this threat, the parents of the child would put a replica of the seal in the crib, and whenever Lilith was in the presence of it, she became helpless.  It&#39;s the equivalent of a vampire to garlic.  Instead, she began to seduce the older men &#40;always a hater of the opposite sex&#41;, and if I remember correctly, she stole their souls either before or after intercourse.  In any case, she WAS the Mother of Demons.

 Okay, here&#39;s what I HAVEN&#39;T found on Angol Moa.  It ISN&#39;T Hawaiian in any sense of the word.  I even checked with my little Brother, and he agrees that Pele is the goddess sealed in the volcano.  So, I ran it through several lists and came up with a very precious few matches. <BR> <BR>-Angol Moa is used once in some Chzek/Zimbabwe document that I can&#39;t make out. <BR> <BR>-Angol Moa is the name of some goddess &#34;traveler&#34; that gave the council powers to change their forms in a story by T-Rex called &#34;Traveler On Trial.&#34;  She was above the supreme elders as the most powerful being in the universe. <BR> <BR>-Angol Moa is one of the bosses in the game &#34;Wild Arms&#34; &#40;I figure that this is where you&#39;ve heard that name before, Nate&#41;.  He is one of the Golems that the team battles, after using Rudy&#39;s &#34;Power Gloves&#34; and obtaining 5 Dulpicator keys, then break out the glass in the arena and jump through.  He appears to have some affinity with the element of ILLUSION.  I wonder if this is the key to the identity to what it means?  I&#39;ve also noticed that every Golem in the &#34;Wild Arms&#34; game is named or paraphrased from gods or deities of destruction. <BR> <BR>1.&#41; Luficer- DUH!  If I have to explain this one, you&#39;re really lost. <BR> <BR>2.&#41; Seto- Unsure, but I&#39;ve seen the name often enough as a hero in Japanese games. <BR> <BR>3.&#41; Diablo- Once again, a no brainer. <BR> <BR>4.&#41; Lolitha- Change &#34;o&#34; to &#34;i&#34; and take out the &#34;a&#34; <BR> <BR>5.&#41; Barbados- I forget where, but I remember when I was reading &#34;Paradise Lost,&#34; one of Lucifer&#39;s lieutenants was named this, and I think it&#39;s yet another name for Lucifer. <BR> <BR>6.&#41; Leviathon- A giant sea creature such as whale, mentioned in the Old Testament &#40;it&#39;s spelled wrong, though&#41;. <BR> <BR>7.&#41; Angol Moa- It&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to find out. <BR> <BR>8.&#41; RaguRala- Oddly enough, this one came out as being foreign code for a boolean expression &#40;if/else statements&#41;; Ragu is if, Rala is else.  Though, I truly think there&#39;s more to this one, one merely needs to dig deeper. <BR> <BR>In conclusion, I can only theorize that  Angol Moa is either the name of a God of the underworld in some middle-eastern religion, or it&#39;s a combination of words meaning &#34;angel and/in devil.&#34;  It&#39;s a bit of a far grasp, but with some translation skills and a little common sense, it works.  Sorry that I couldn&#39;t get discover it for certain, Nate.

 Naga is actually mythical in any sense, it&#39;s been around for as long as one can imagine.  Depending on what you read or hear, it&#39;s any number of things; it&#39;s either snake body, human head; snake body, human torso and head; human body, snake head; sometimes, I&#39;ve seen that the Naga in question can transform between these states, and rarely enough into a pure human form.

 Correction, Punisher: &#34;Moo&#34; comes from the Japanese word &#34;Mu,&#34; which basically means &#34;void,&#34; &#34;nothingness,&#34; etc.

Naga - generally considered to be named for the man-snakes found in the Hindu Vedas. They are reported as having the head or upper body and head of a man. <BR> <BR>Baku - Is known as Tapir in the early design sketches, but was changed, probably to avoid problems with Pokemon comparisons &#40;Drowzee&#41;. <BR> <BR>Dagon - Lovecraft mentioned it, but he stole it whole-cloth from a Middle Eastern religion. <BR> <BR>And the Japanese actually call the big lizard, Gojirah.

 John is correct, and has verifiable references. <BR> <BR>Please cite actual, specific references rather than &#34;an asian language&#34;. Or &#34;where I come from&#34;. All you are doing is creating more work for the moderators who have to edit this unfounded speculation from the thread. <BR> <BR>Also note, deliberately posting incorrect/unverified information is a violation of the posting guidelines for this board.

 Just for sake of clarifying on the &#39;Zilla... <BR>The original name, Gojira, translates from the  <BR>Japanese slang it&#39;s derived from to &#39;Gorilla <BR>Whale&#39;, which the &#39;Zilla resembles more the latter  <BR>half than the former.  I don&#39;t quite know enough  <BR>Japanese to do a full etymology on the word, but <BR>I can at least confirm that much. <BR> <BR>Also, Hercules in the MR context refers more to <BR>the Hercules beetle, who&#39;s prodigious horn is the  <BR>helm decoration for the Durahan/Beaclon cross.  <BR> <BR>From the Japanese mythology I&#39;d studied, Baku  <BR>weren&#39;t necessarily -evil-, though they were  <BR>definitely detrimental to craftsmen and artisans,  <BR>who would find themselves unable to create after a  <BR>Baku devoured their dreams.  I also recall  <BR>something about how the act of catching one would  <BR>lead to an artisan creating their greatest  <BR>masterpiece by using some of the leftover dream- <BR>essence, but I digress.  Just like in MR, though,  <BR>they ARE funny lookin&#39; buggers...

 309: Siren &#91;Undine/Joker&#93; Greek Mythology-said to have been beautiful &#40;sometimes described as bird-like and other times mermaid-like&#41; nymphs who lived on rocks in the ocean and lured sailors to their deaths with their beautiful songs.

 A late confirmation, talking with a friend: <BR> <BR>Selketo: The Egyptian goddess of magic is known as &#39;selket&#39;. She has the ability to talk to scorpions, among many other powers.
