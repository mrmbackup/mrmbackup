 I hope I am not rehashing old info, but I did not see any training methods that were more user friendly.  So, I am posting my normal method. <BR> <BR>Stage 1 <BR>First four months <BR> <BR>·	Light Drill &#40;usually Shoot&#41; <BR>·	Mint Leaf, Light Drill <BR>·	Rest <BR> <BR>Food:	Milk, unless monster doesn’t like them.  <BR>Errantries:	No <BR>Expeditions:	No <BR>Battles:	No <BR> <BR>Stage 2 <BR>From four months to &#43;9~&#43;11 on favorable drills <BR> <BR>·	Candy &#40;if monster is normal or skinnier&#41;, Light Drill <BR>·	Mint Leaf, Light Drill <BR>·	Nuts Oil, Light Drill <BR>·	Mint Leaf, Rest <BR> <BR>Food:	Tablets, unless monster doesn’t like them.  Generally use Meat or Cup Jellies otherwise.  .  I try to feed the monster the same week I give it a Nuts Oil. <BR> <BR>Errantries:	No <BR>Expeditions:	No <BR>Battles:	No <BR> <BR>Stage 3 <BR>From &#43;9~&#43;11 to retirement <BR> <BR>·	Candy &#40;if monster is normal or skinnier&#41;, Heavy Drill <BR>·	Mint Leaf, Heavy Drill <BR>·	Nuts Oil, Heavy Drill <BR>·	Mint Leaf, Rest <BR> <BR>Food:	Tablets, unless monster doesn’t like them.  Generally use Meat or Cup Jellies otherwise.  I try to feed the monster the same week I give it a Nuts Oil. <BR>Errantries:	Strictly for getting new techniques and only when there is a sale.  Make sure monster is well rested.  Mint Leaf before and after Errantry.  Rest two weeks after. <BR>Battles:	Only if you are pretty sure you are going to win.  Then, as often as possible.  I try about every other month or so.  Make sure monster is well rested before the Battle.  Rest after the battle. <BR>Expeditions:	As you desire.  Make sure monster is well rested after expedition.  Mint Leaf after expedition <BR> <BR>Notes: <BR> <BR>Stress and fatigue are two major factors in reducing a monster’s lifespan.  This method tries to keep those levels reduced.  Mint Leaves, Rest, the right Food and Battle can help reduce stress.  Nuts Oil, Rest, and the right Food help reduce fatigue. <BR> <BR>Good vs Evil:  I tend to raise good monsters so, that means no treats and scold when the monster fails.  Praise whenever you are asked.  Etc,. <BR> <BR>The biggest problem with this method is money.  If the monster lives 6y 4m, you will spend 89,040g, not including Errantries or miscellaneous items purchased before and after Battle, Errantries, and Expeditions.  In the first two years, expect to spend about 27,000g with no return on investment.  However, once your monster starts battling, you should easily start to turn a profit.  Official Tourneys alone should net you ~13,000g.  Around your monster’s fourth birthday &#40;give or take six months&#41;, it should reach B-Class and start earning the real money.  At this point, you will have spent &#43;55,000g, however your Official Tourneys will have raked in ~8,100g.  And, with all the other battles, you should have earned ~30,000g, not including all the prizes you could sell.  If you assume eight Disc Chips at 500g a piece, that would give you another 4,000g.  So, by the time your monster reaches B-Class, you will have spent ~55,000g and earned ~ 42,000g.  Now, B-Class has some of the best tourneys around for making money.  And, you can fight in the A-Class tournaments.  If you fight in the three precious metal tournaments &#40;Papas Cup in July, Papas Cup in October, IMa Chariman’s Cup in November&#41;, you will earn &#43;11,000g for the tournaments and get the three metals worth of prizes &#40;approx. ~16,000g&#41;, bringing your earnings up to ~69,000g.  Now, the profit start to build for each B-Class tourney is bringing in &#43;3,000g to &#43;5,000g, then tack on the prize.  By the time the monster retires, it will have earned &#43;10,000g more than it cost to raise.  I’ve cleared 100,000g in profit with monster that have made it to the M-4 tourneys.  &#40;I think I rambled too much here&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, the whole thrust of this document is an easy training method to follow to raise a monster.  The key is to keep stress and fatigue low, and this system tries to do it.  You do not need a checklist, reams of notes, or to waste tons of time flipping between the ranch and the town, or resetting because an item did not work right.  You will need some patience in the beginning and about 30,000g to get the process started, but by the end of your monster’s life, he will have earned that back and much more. <BR> <BR>Please add you comments and such.  I would be glad to hear them. <BR> <BR>Varthlokkur

 Just wanted to add some data.  I am running Woody Hopper &#40;Hopper/Mock&#41; that I got from a CD.  At 3y 3m, Splinter &#40;the Hopper&#41; became B-Class.  Between July and December, it fought in every non-Official Tournament except one.  They were &#40;in order&#41;: <BR> <BR>Tourney             Purse    Prize &#40;value&#41; <BR>Papas Cup &#40;Summer&#41;  4000g    Gold &#40;6000&#41; <BR>Invitational        3000     Dragon Tusk &#40;3000&#41; <BR>Manseitan Cup       3000     Manseitan &#40;1500&#41; <BR>Papas Cup &#40;Autumn&#41;  4000     Silver &#40;4000&#41; <BR>Torble Port Cup     5000     Disc Chip &#40;500&#41; <BR>IMa Chairman Cup    3000     Platina &#40;8000&#41; <BR> <BR>Total:            22,000g    23,000g <BR> <BR>So, in the span of 6 short months, this monster has earned 45,000g, most of it&#39;s raising costs.  At this point, it has at least another year to live.  At this point, I can freeze it and do the July to December money run a couple of times &#40;could squeeze out 90,000 to 180,000g&#41;.  Or, just run it until retirement &#40;which is what I will probably do&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Varthlokkur

 varthlokkur, seems like a workable information - let me know when you are done adding to this thread, then i will move it into the methods folder.

 I was looking for a method that I could teach my friend so he can get back into playing this game. Well, I was looking through some of these old posts the other day and I found this. Needless to say, I gave it to my friend to use. And what he chose to use it on suprised me. So I&#39;m posting his Cawken&#39;s stats which I think are very decent for a Ducken. <BR>Name:Draven <BR>Type:Cawken&#40;Ducken/???&#41; <BR>Age:6yr4mo&#40;still under a Gold peach&#41; <BR>Method:This method&#40;my friend says this kicks a$$.&#41; <BR>Lif:455 <BR>Pow:908 <BR>Int:238 <BR>Ski:551 <BR>Spd:521 <BR>Def:601

 &#40;continuing earlier post&#41; <BR>Well, my friend really seems to enjoy this method so I and my friend would like to extend our thanks and my gratitude&#40;for making a method that&#39;s easily teachable&#41;Varthlokkur.
