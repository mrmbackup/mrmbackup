 You must shop at the item shop a lot, not like every week, just somewhat regularly. Eventually, &#40;i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s on a certaint day&#41; shop owner will give you strange seeds. Colt immediatly plants them, after a few years they grow into a tree. Eventually, Colt says that a tree is blooming. It is the tree you planted, but it seems to have moved &#40;Dun-da-dun&#41;. Later that week, the flowers are gone and the tree is dying. She will ask if you want to water it, i said yes i&#39;m not sure what happens if u say no. After this happens, you&#39;ll need to have a monster die. &#40;suekie sueso comes in handy here.&#41; When you come back from the funeral, Colt says something is weird. &#40;the tree&#39;s gone too&#41; then u will see the Mock come out of your ranch. Pabs tells u a bit about it, then askes if you would like to raise it. I said yes, i don&#39;t know what happens if u say no. Then colt names it Gonzalaz. congrats, u just got a Mock.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s were it needs help. <BR>1. does she give u the seeds on a certaint week? <BR>2. what if you don&#39;t water it? <BR>3. what if you don&#39;t raise it? <BR> <BR>That&#39;s about it. Thanx.

 1. No, not that I&#39;m aware. <BR> <BR>2. You don&#39;t start with an automatic one point of loyalty. <BR> <BR>3. Pabs doesn&#39;t give you any choice. Once you accept it, mocks are unlocked even if you don&#39;t train it.

 Pabs doesn&#39;t really give you a choice. If you try to get rid of it, he stops you and gives you a speech about good breeders raise the hardest creatures or some such. You can not give the Mock away. If you want to get rid of it &#40;NOT recommended&#41;, you&#39;ll have to take it to the market. Mocks have bad beginning stats, but they live so long that everything except DEF comes up to decent levels. Raise INT first. It maxxes easily.

 Okay, this just figures. I&#39;m trying not to read &#34;spoilers&#34; on how to get the different monsters, except I went ahead and let myself do so for Mocks, because I thought they sounded neat, wasn&#39;t really getting any more monster breeds unlocked, and wanted to try to get one. <BR> <BR>So is there &#42;something&#42; I&#39;m missing here? I forget what trainer level I am.. five I think, I&#39;ve had a monster go to S class, but not win any of the Big 4 yet. &#40;My current Kitten is working on it, but is probably gonna start going downhill soon. She&#39;s already over 4 years old.&#41; I&#39;ve been going to the shop on average at least once a month, sometimes as much as 3 times in a month, for the past few game years. Nothing. Is there something I&#39;m missing? Something you need to have unlocked, or to have sold to the shop at one point &#40;I&#39;m thinking maybe either one of the flowers you get, or those weird &#34;clay doll&#34; things your monsters give you that look sorta like trees, or something&#41; or am I just having &#42;really&#42; bad luck?  <BR> <BR>Anyone know? Can anyone guess? <BR> <BR>Oh, and when &#34;Auntie&#34; does get the seeds in the shop, does she just give them to you, or does she say something about them being offered, or do they just get &#34;snuck in&#34; on the list?

 auntie clearly and unequivocally gives you the seeds - theres a whole dialog between her and colt that takes place, which once it begins, you have no control over.

 You just have to water the tree when Colt gives you a choice later.  If you never unlock them, you won&#39;t be the first- several people have complained about it, and personally, I believed that one person who hypothesized that you either get them in your first 20 years, or you never get &#39;em.  I believe I was in the year 1011 when I got the seeds.

 Oh that really really bites. So in other words, if I want to get Mocks at all, I need to start the game over, and re-unlock &#42;everything&#42;, start up from scratch again? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think so. &#42;sigh&#42;

 Heh, thanks. And now just for the record... <BR> <BR>Just about a year or so after I reached fourth trainer rank in my new game, sure enough, I was given the seeds for the Mock. Now I haven&#39;t seen anyone else mention this, and I&#39;d think that they would &#40;but never assume&#41;... but when I got the seeds, it was just as Auntie got in a new item. Magic bananas, in my case. She announced that she got this new item, and then went right into the spiel about the seeds. <BR> <BR>Considering this, and that Auntie also talks about getting the seeds from a merchant basically that sells her new things from time to time, and the fact that apparently people haven&#39;t been getting mocks if they don&#39;t get them within the first 20 years or so, perhaps there is a link between Auntie getting in new items and getting the seeds? Either she does them both at once, or if she tells you about the new item on a week that she&#39;s having a sale, then she gives you the seeds on your next visit? Or was it just a coincidence on my part? <BR> <BR>Thoughts?

 Good call on the theories.  And I guess if you want to stick to your own strict code of ethics and avoid the gameshark, that&#39;s your prerogative.  Still, I wouldn&#39;t look down on anyone who had to fall back on it due to missing a time limit &#40;something that certainly shouldn&#39;t be involved in getting any monsters in MR3&#41;.

 The first time I started a game I didn&#39;t get the seeds until after I had been playing over 20 years, but I was a bad trainer and still at rank four.  This time I got the seeds in year 6, two visits to the store after I got to rank four.  I really think getting the seeds has something to do with being in the fourth rank, has anyone disproven that theory yet?

 Hrm.. I&#39;m pretty positive I was exactly in rank four, if that input helps at all.

 My input is that this may very well be a glitch, rather than a deliberate &#39;time limit&#39; placed on the game. Very possibly, the seeds are supposed to be unlocked at a particular point and time and throughout. However, if you pass that specific point, the game wasn&#39;t programmed to take that into account.  <BR> <BR>In other words: You&#39;re fourth rank. That is &#40;concievably&#41; when you&#39;re supposed to get the seeds. However, you don&#39;t go to the store, and instead go on to fifth rank. Then sixth rank. The game is now programmed &#40;accidently, likely&#41; to accept the fact that you were given the seeds, and doesn&#39;t offer them to you. Either that, or a specific time &#40;20 years, most people have said&#41;, and after that, the unlocking of one thing &#39;locks&#39; the seeds away by accident. <BR> <BR>Just my two-cents, and a little help for poor Tecmo, who might otherwise get a deluge of annoyance. It&#39;s possible that this is a programming error.

 I&#39;m pretty sure I was rank 4 when I got the seeds, too.  The first time I went to the shop after I  <BR>made Rank 4, I got the seeds.  And I had been training more than 20 years, -I think-.

 Well, I didn&#39;t get the seeds till I hit rank 4 in year 1033 &#40;Turns away ashamed&#41;, anyway, I&#39;m positive it&#39;s just easier to get the seeds when you&#39;re rank 4.

<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'kurasu'-!>
I&#39;m a little unclear on this, but &#40;just FYI&#41; I know that I&#39;ve gotten Master rank before 1010, so it IS possible without a Game Shark &#40;My winning Monster, Trixie the Pixie...It was a goof start.  as I&#39;ve stated before, I didn&#39;t keep it.&#41;...just not easy to do for a novice or the like. <BR> <BR>As for the seeds, I agree that all of the times that I&#39;ve restarted &#40;both my Dad and me&#41;, the seeds have came at 4th rank, and usually in Spring.  I doubt the Spring concept has anything to do with it, but I personally believe that a 4th rank trainer is the only key. <BR> <BR>
