just a question to pass the time...  <BR>people sometimes max out stats. me, once i get a monster above 950 i stop, because it can&#39;t go up any more levels. life, it matters. in the other categories, does it? in 2p battles would a 999/999/999/999/999/999 monster have any advantage over a 999/950/950/950/950/950? in breeding, dadge sez the combination is good - do you get any benefit in a category with 999 rather than 950? in expedition, will your peach finding chances increase with int of 999 rather than 950?  <BR> <BR>tough thing to do research on - i realize. i&#39;m sure not going to. just wondering, that&#39;s all...  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, April 15, 2000  <BR> <BR>Answers <BR>It does make a difference but not much. Every time your stat grows a level it increases more than if it doesn&#39;t.

Also, you can&#39;t get the same side goodies from Errantry and Heavy Drills if you max out a stat. And even if stopping too soon means I never get it maxed out...what does it matter? If I have a Golem with only 900 Power and Defense against someone else whose Golem has maxed-out Power and Defense, but MY Golem has 200 points more Skill and Speed, who&#39;s going to win?  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, April 15, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I would only raise you chance to hit alitte from 950 to 999 in skill and similar with speed  <BR> <BR>-- J &#40;<A HREF="mailto:nemesis_7777@yahoo.com">nemesis_7777@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, April 15, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>If you were to get your stats at 950 then after five fights at S class @ &#43;10 points per stat you would max out without any further effort.  <BR> <BR>-- <A HREF="mailto:M@k">M@k</A>@VeLL! &#40;<A HREF="mailto:www.---@whatever.com">www.---@whatever.com</A>&#41;, April 16, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>not quite makavelli&#91;excuse the dropping of the @&#39;s. if you don&#39;t mind&#93;. you only get gains in 3 stats after battle. so if you were at 950 in everything, you would need 49 x 6 = 294 total points to max. assuming ~30 pts stat gain per s level tourney won, and an even distribution as to the stat being gained, it would take 10 s level victories to max out.  <BR>that&#39;s the closest i can get to an rna impersonation, btw.  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, April 16, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Torey, didn&#39;t you once post about semi-controlling your stats gained after combat? &#40;sorry if it was someone else, I&#39;m not sure&#41; Anyway, if that turned out to work, this would be a good instance to try and use it. If that was you, how did it turn out? I tried a small # of time, with no conclusive evidence either way.

 I started that whole Controlling Post-Battle Stat Gains thing, along with the proviso that you almost always get 2 of the 3 stats you &#34;selected.&#34;  It&#39;s worked for me very faithfully.

 For combining purposes, there is deleted evidence that shows that the actual number value of a stat is what changes a combination prospect, not the level value of a stat.

 nate, i use it too sometimes - i think you stay it accurately:  doing it noticeably increases the chances of, but does not guarantee, those stats being among the ones raised postbattle. <BR> <BR>rna, so a 999 is 49 points better than a 950 in combining.  i can see where at the 500 level that would be a significant difference - 549 is almost a 10% increase over 500.  but 999 is only a ~5% increase over 950.  5% of a monster who gets a good score in that stat after combining, say 450, starts that monster with 470 instead.  hmmm, that&#39;s a week of heavy training...

 Except for LIF, the effect of the stats only changes for every 50 pts &#40;1 level&#41; so 1 POW is as effective as 49 POW.  Likewise, 999 POW doesn&#39;t so anymore damage than 950 POW.
