I&#39;ve been raising my monster very well. I fed it mint leaves to take away stress,never went on an errantry, only went to battle twice and I slept when it seems well. It hit 3 yrs old and it died. what really got me mad is that she didn&#39;t tell me that he should retire.  I also noticed that just before my zuum/naga died, it was getting 2,3 and 4 on the light errantries. Before that it was doing at least 10 on each. I wanted to know if there is another way to live longer, and if i am correct about monster stats not raising as high when it is about to die.  <BR> <BR>-- Mike Sugs &#40;<A HREF="mailto:sugan@ibm.net">sugan@ibm.net</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000  <BR> <BR>try 2nd-gen or later-gen monsters. it&#39;s really hard to make a 1st-gen monster live long, so if you can&#39;t get the desired stats for your monster, try finding a fine/good/great combo in the lab and combine. the next monster should be better than your previous one.  <BR> <BR>-- MaJoBeRiDiOmEn!®™ &#40;<A HREF="mailto:organomd@hvisions.com">organomd@hvisions.com</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>she only gives warnings on birthdays  <BR> <BR>-- RaPtOr2157 &#40;<A HREF="mailto:raptor2157@aol.com">raptor2157@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>You are correct about stats decreasing when it is ready to die.  <BR>I have created a thread for rookie trainers that want their monster to live longer, but don&#39;t know how. It is located in the &#34;raising/training section of the board, and is entitled:  <BR>&#34;So you want your monster to live longer?&#34; <BR>I suggest that you read it. It should help you out immensely!  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Actually, wether you get retirement warnings or not depends on how you answered the quiz at the begining. If you said that there was something in life you would die for or once you set a goal you have to achieve it no matter what, you probably won&#39;t get warnings.  <BR> <BR>-- Miss Carrie &#40;<A HREF="mailto:musicality1@earthlink.net">musicality1@earthlink.net</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>i answered the question wrong at the start and didn&#39;t get warnings for more than a 100 years. suddenly, now, my last 3 monsters, right on their birthday, got retirement warnings. i basically blew them off, and went a few more months with each w/o any deaths. wierd!  <BR>&#34;I&#39;ve looked at retirement warnings from both sides now&#34;  <BR>&#34;i really don&#39;t know retirement warnings...at all!&#34;  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, March 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I never get retirement warnings at any time except after birthdays. If you get one, expect your monster to live anywheres from 1 week to 6 months more.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, March 12, 2000.

 Gosamerwings, i belive you were referrign to Miss Carrie, the response below mine.  I was the one talking about the &#34;So you want your monster to live longer?&#34; thread.  It&#39;s a small mistake, could&#39;ve happened to anyone.
