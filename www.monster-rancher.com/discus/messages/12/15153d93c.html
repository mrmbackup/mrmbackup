 Just wanted to ask a few questions that I couldn&#39;t find answers to in the archive, and to state a few little &#34;quirks&#34; some of you may or may not have noticed. <BR> <BR>• What is Resistance? <BR>I know, I know. This has probably been asked HUNDREDS of times before, but I just couldn&#39;t find anything pertaining to it in the archive. <BR> <BR>• Item #0028, The &#34;Genie Lamp&#34;? <BR>This was stated in the Gameshark section as a &#34;Genie Lamp&#34;, but it looks so much more like a potion to me... It seems to function like Troron and Paradoxine, as it adds 25 POW and SKI for every successful drill for a period of one month. However, besides the expected  <BR>life-span hit, there is no stat loss as one would see with Paradoxine. I took a monster with 11 weeks left to live and fed it the item. It did indeed die the next week. So much for hoping that the programmers forgot to program in a lifespan hit. Nonetheless, this item could be considered, but the lifespan hit may actually be greater then that of Paradoxine. <BR> <BR>• What&#39;s with Colt&#39;s face? <BR>If you press the Help button &#40;O&#41; at the Swim drill, Colt does a very strange face... She happens to close her eyes like the face she displays when your monster is &#34;Very Well&#34;, but with a frown instead of a smile. <BR> <BR>• Crazy Hueys <BR>If you&#39;ve seen a Huey &#40;Henger/Metalner&#41;, you know it has a little UFO that follows it around. But that UFO displays a strange glitch when your Huey finally kicks the bucket... It seems to fall off the screen, but when your ranch opens up, you can see it below the ranch. Its hard to explain, so try it for yourself to see. <BR> <BR>•Dang Dirty Apes <BR>As in my other post, I stated that Waranmo, who is the only IMa Ape Opponent, has a special tech, and is in C-Class. He&#39;s the only monster &#40;discounting a few errantry monsters&#41; that has a special teach below B-Class. What a cheater! <BR> <BR>•Toucan Assault <BR>If you&#39;ve ever feel angry at that Joy, you can &#34;hit&#34; her by making your monster play truant on the pull drill. Good for a chuckle. :&#41; <BR> <BR>Well, that&#39;s most of what I&#39;ve seen. Everything else seems to have been posted already.

 Oh, sorry for the double post, but I just remembered something else I would like to ask: <BR> <BR>•What is the &#34;Niton Trick&#34;? <BR>I saw Lisa mention it in a post in another topic &#40;I believe it was My disc changed Monsters&#41;, but it was never explained, and I couldn&#39;t find any other info about it.

 The Niton Trick was discovered by Monster Fenrick. It is a way to get a Niton without having the right CD. Essentially, you go to the shrine and swap discs but open up and re-swap before the game tells you it&#39;s ready.
