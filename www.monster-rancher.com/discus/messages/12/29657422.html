 I am experimenting with the MK 3, and so far, it hasn&#39;t shown any problems with my monsters losing lifespan. If it works out, I&#39;ll post it up within a few weeks &#40;I wanna give it the full run-through, first&#41;. <BR> <BR>My first method was effective for the starting person, what with the minimum number of objects, and the maximum gains for it. However, the one I&#39;m working with, while more item-intensive, is still both simple and easy to remember. <BR> <BR>First stage: LD/LD/LD/rest, ?/ML/NO/ML <BR>The MK 3 method brings the HD into the mix, even at this early age. However, I have yet to discern if this is going to cause lifespan hits, or if it does a lot for the stat-gain. I have a feeling that the LD might be the lesser of two evils, but time shall tell. While the items keep the stress levels down, they aren&#39;t _as_ neccessary at the moment. I mostly use them to keep the &#39;rhythm&#39; going. <BR> <BR>Second stage-Third Stage: HD/LD/HD/rest, ?/ML/NO/ML <BR>This keeps the monster from getting stressed, while losing a minimum of lifespan, from what I can gather &#40;I haven&#39;t done the full math on it, yet&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Errantries: I never send the monster on more than four errantries, if I&#39;m trying to get him to HoF status. Otherwise, I send them every cheap errantry, so as to both save money and gather moves for later breeding. I do it on the first of the month &#40;as I was convinced through the numbers I was getting&#41;, and ML/rest immediately afterwards. NO and LD, then ML/LD, and a final rest. Then, back into the normal pattern.  <BR> <BR>That, in a nutshell, is how the newest of my methods work. The suezo I put up was trained using that method, and you can see how well it works for things like lifespan &#40;yes, I did use both peaches, but didn&#39;t use a banana at all&#41; and stats &#40;no maxxing out, but it gets the numbers where you need &#39;em&#41; <BR> <BR>My wracky is presently being raised with the MK 3 method. I&#39;ll post up how well it works.

 Update on the style MK 3: I killed off a Suezi Suezo to get a Wracky, and started raising it in HD/LD/HD almost from the very first day of its life &#40;I gave it around four months to stop failing so much before I started&#41; He is now my second HoF&#39;er in my new game. His stats: <BR>Lif: 671 <BR>Pow: 324 <BR>Int: 999 <BR>Ski: 404 <BR>Spd: 999 <BR>Def: 582 <BR>Total: 3979 &#40;and with enough time to break 4000, easily&#41; <BR>Age: 10y &#40;and three weeks&#41; <BR> <BR>He went through his first growth at 3y 6m. He didn&#39;t Prime until over 7 years old. He was peached twice, and is not yet showing any lowering in numbers &#40;and has been doing S-class fights for several years, now&#41; <BR> <BR>Needless to say, the adjustment on my raising style doesn&#39;t seem to have lowered the lifespan any. It works best on things where you only have one or two stats that you&#39;re looking for &#40;in this case: speed and intelligence&#41;, but it could be used to round a creature out, as well. <BR> <BR>Please note: they will not be getting _too_ good of numbers, when you start them at this young. However, they&#39;ll be getting 3-5 in _two_ things, rather than just the one. And with the ML the style uses, the stress never seems to get high enough &#40;even as a baby&#41; to hurt their lifestyle overmuch.
