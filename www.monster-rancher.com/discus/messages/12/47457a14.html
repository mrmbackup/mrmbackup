 demonknight, over in the long fenrick tourney thread at m-r.com, posted that, in his experience, the monster in the player 1 position wins more than the monster in the player 2 position.  fenrick, hengersrock, mepersoner, or anyone with more computer ai battling experience than me - have you noticed such an effect?  has anyone ever done a long series, alternating the monsters&#39; positions, to make sure there is no game bias?

 Personally, I think it is just a Myth.  with the Many, Many, Many Tourney Battles I have been doing, I have alternated 1P and 2P and the outcomes on average are always the same.  the underdog STILL gets the occasional Power-up and KO just as he would in 1st player over a series of matches. <BR> <BR>I honestly think it is just an observation that people &#34;try&#34; to look for &#40;1P winning more&#41; and that the majority of those people don&#39;t bother switching them around and trying another 10 fights to see if the overall outcome is about the same.

 This got me thinking.. so I did the following. <BR> <BR>1player Vs 2player: Advantage Player 1? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to do 10 battles, pitting my best monster, Zues against him self. <BR> <BR>Zues: Durahan/Durahan <BR>8 years 9 months <BR>All stats 999 except speed which is 207. <BR> <BR>All 10 bouts will be computer controlled. The results of each fight will be recorded here. <BR> <BR>Fight one:	Player one by a knock out. <BR>Fight two:	Player one by a knock out. <BR>Fight three:	Player two by a knock out. <BR>Fight four:	Player two by a knock out. <BR>Fight five:	Player two by a percentage. <BR>Fight six:	Player one by a knock out. <BR>Fight seven:	Player one by a knock out. <BR>Fight eight:	Player two by a knock out. <BR>Fight nine:	Player one by a percentage. <BR>Fight ten:	Player one by a percentage. <BR> <BR>The count is player one 6 player two 4 <BR>Player one won 60% of the 10 battles. While player two only one 40% of the ten battles. This only a preliminary study, will research more later. <BR> <BR>Now I would like others to perform this same test. Using any monster you fell like and post their results here. <BR> <BR>DemonKnight

 That&#39;s really not a big separation.  If the player  <BR>two had won one more it would&#39;ve been 50-50

 Player 1 Vs Player 2: Continued study <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to use the same format as last time. Only this time I&#39;ll fight 20 times in a row. <BR> <BR>Zues: Durahan/Durahan <BR>All stats maxed, except speed which is 207 <BR>8 years 9 months old. <BR> <BR>Fight one:		Player one by a knock out <BR>Fight two:		Player two by a knock out <BR>fight three:	        Player two by a knock out <BR>Fight four:		Player two by a knock out <BR>Fight five:		Player two by a percentage <BR>Fight six:		Player two by a knock out <BR>Fight seven:	        Player two by a knock out <BR>Fight eight:	        Player one by a percentage <BR>Fight nine:		Player two by a percentage <BR>Fight ten:		Player two by a percentage <BR>Fight eleven:	        player one by a percentage <BR>Fight Twelve:	        Player two by a knock out <BR>Fight Thirteen:	        Player one by a percentage <BR>Fight Fourteen:	        Player two by a knock out <BR>Fight Fifteen:	        Player two by a knock out <BR>Fight Sixteen:     	Player two by a knock out <BR>Fight Seventeen: 	Player two by a percentage <BR>Fight Eighteen:	        Player one by a knock out <BR>Fight Nineteen:	        Player one by a knock out <BR>Fight twenty:	        Player one by a percentage <BR> <BR>Player one, takes 35% of the victorys, while player two takes 65% of the battles. Almost the opposite of what I found yesterday.&#40;player1 took 60% and player 2 took 40% yesterday.&#41;. I shall contiune to do this for at least another 4 sets of 20.

thanx a lot demonknight.  this is good baseline data to have. <BR> <BR>Noted that you mention in chat that the 4 more 20s are done, bringing the total to 100, with exactly 50% for each side.
