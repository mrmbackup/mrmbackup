 Paradoxine, a wonderful drug for long-lived Monsters. Most people know it&#39;s effects: <BR> <BR>-18 Weeks of lifespan <BR>&#43;30 Skill upon successful &#40;drill/errantry&#41; stat-gains for 4 weeks <BR>&#43;30 Power upon successful &#40;drill/errantry&#41; stat-gains for 4 weeks <BR> <BR>But, for me, the problem lies in actually GETTING it. I only ended up getting some ONCE, maybe twice, which was fairly early in the game. Maybe in the first 4-5 years or so... I got a total of 5 Vials of Paraoxine. However, even though I went to the Torles Expedition nearly every year &#40;even soft-resetting to go again, if I didn&#39;t get any the first time&#41;, I never got one again.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m at roughly Year 1046 now, 40 years since the last time I got a Vial of Paradoxine. Is there some method, or perhaps an event that triggers their appearance, that I do not know about? NOBODY is this unlucky.

 I am. 3 seperate monsters with 850 intelligence and in 20 tries I found it a grand total of zero times.  <BR>Just max out the intelligence of a selected monster and hope. After 10 years I finally managed to get 8  <BR>and now I have a wracky with maxxed out skill/power aged 9 months. You basically &#42;need&#42; 950  <BR>intelligence  <BR>though.

 Some items are linked to the monster&#39;s rank. Try getting to B or better. I am not certain that this will solve your problem, but, we have seen it affect a few other items.

 I&#39;m always at B Rank when I go for expeditions, since I end up doing a lot of fighting with 1st Gen monsters &#40;Combining to get more starting moves&#41;, which I&#39;ve only raised Gen 1 stuff so far, except for a Gen 2 Mocchi &#40;Sparticus, and he lived up to that name easily, with 850&#43; in all stats, 8-9 years of life before freezing!&#41;.... but I digress. <BR> <BR>I DID manage to get a few more on one trip recently. It was a Gen 2 Jill, my first Jill ever. =D It ended up snagging 2 Paradoxines on it&#39;s first trip to Papas. I think there may be a connection with the Papas and Kawarea expeditions of some sort. <BR> <BR>In the Kawarea expedition, when you find a God&#39;s Slate, Dr. Talico makes some remarks about it, and the same thing happens in Papas with Rovest when you grab the Paradoxine. I never bothered doing the Kawarea trip a second time, since I grabbed my Mask and Fire Feather the first time.. But I decided to go again, and got junk to sell &#43; 2x Gods Slates. When I had gone to Parepare and got more Gold Peached, Karvo did his little story as well... I finally went back to Papas, I went right to the Cave and found my 2 Paradoxines. :D <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to try again, but it won&#39;t be for a while since I am messin around with a Serenity &#40;Pixie/Plant&#41;. I wonder if anybody wants to take a look into this &#34;Expedition Chain&#34; as well?

 Also, that Jill&#39;s INT was somewhere in the 600&#39;s, I believe. I&#39;m not sure now. =&#40;

 To be honest I think that it&#39;s more luck with expeditions than a &#39;chain&#39; of sorts. As you say, you can  <BR>go years without finding them but I managed to get two paradoxines in one expedition twice off the bat  <BR>after a lot of years of around ten/fifteen attempts each of finding nothing. Having said that, both of  <BR>those times it was with a Jill, whhich obviously is initially unlocked on the same expedition. Again,  <BR>probably chance, but it does make me wonder, seeing as I have Lummox &#40;Jill with maxxed intelligence&#41;  <BR>and Lemming &#40;Oscerot with maxxed intellience&#41;, and Lemming never found anything. They&#39;re matched up for  <BR>a great combo though, so after training the curent wracky family I&#39;m doing I&#39;ll get a Bengal and  <BR>experiment once more :B

 Honestly, I think what we are probably seeing is just the effects of something with a low probability of occurring. Even if an event has a 50/50 probability, such as a coin toss, it&#39;s possible to see 100 consecutive incidents with just one of the results, like 100 tails in a row. <BR> <BR>To get any sort of handle on this, you&#39;d need to start with a thousand or more resets in the same week to the same expedition to possibly see any sort of real pattern.

 I agree, bad luck is prolly the biggest factor here. I&#39;ve gone on 5 expeditions and have found it 5 times. Twice on the first trip and nothing on the last trip. oh fyi... i used a Blue Terror with 800ish INT, he was B-rank i believe.

 What are the chances of it appearing, anyway? Are they indeed like 50/50? Do you have any Data on it to post? Would be one of those &#39;good to know&#39; things, imo. =&#41; <BR> <BR>Also, it sucks that I can find Gold Peaches like every time &#40;at least 2 per trip, too&#41; but NEVER Paradoxines. =&#40;

 Hmmm, i don&#39;t remember seeing any hard evidence as to the actual probabilities, but i would assume they&#39;re low. I just picked up a paradoxine today as a matter of fact. oh and congrats on the Jill =&#41;

 It definitely has a lower percentage chance than any of the other &#39;rare&#39; items. I also can find a peach every  <BR>expedition and sometimes two, and I&#39;ve found the others first time. It does make sense though, seeing as it&#39;s  <BR>by far the best item in the game for certain monsters, i.e Wracky, Niton, Gaboo.
