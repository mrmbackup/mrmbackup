<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>Corpse</B> on <B>Monday, July 23, 2001 - 01:02 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 Recently, I asked someone over at another board to challenge me to raise something rather difficult. I&#39;ll explain that later, but what I have to say now is what&#39;s important. I did this using a really good, no-reloading or resetting method that I came up with.  <BR> <BR>Before I explain the method, I have used all of the other methods out there on the Net, and I have had sucess with all of them. So, just for fun, I thought I&#39;d retool my own method and post it up for the public to view and use. <BR> <BR>For this method you&#39;ll need the following.... <BR>1. A monster that likes Tablets. <BR>2. A lot of money, at least 300,000 <BR>3. A marginal amount of paitence <BR> <BR>Now that you&#39;ve read that, it&#39;s time to start. The first thing is that for the first part of this method, you&#39;ll only be raising your monster on the third and fourth weeks of any given month. This is to allow for the Tablets to be fit into the middle of a month&#39;s worth of items/drills. <BR> <BR>Beginning on the third week of a month, I do... <BR>starting with 0fa,0st&#40;fatigue/stress&#41; <BR>wk3 {0fa,0st} <BR>NO-{0fa,0st} <BR>HD-{15fa,12st} &#40;39&#41; <BR>wk4 {15fa,12st} <BR>ML-{15fa,6st} &#40;27&#41; <BR>HD- {30fa,18st} &#40;66&#41; <BR>TAB-{30fa,3st} &#40;36&#41; <BR>wk3 {30fa,3st} &#40;36&#41; <BR>NO- {2fa,3st} &#40;8&#41; <BR>HD- {17fa,15st} &#40;47&#41; <BR>wk4 {17fa,15st} &#40;47&#41; <BR>ML- {17fa,8st} &#40;37&#41; <BR>LD- {27fa,13st} &#40;53&#41; <BR>TAB- {27fa,0st} &#40;27&#41; <BR>and repeat from the top <BR>wk3 {27fa,0st} &#40;27&#41; <BR>NO- {0fa,0st} &#40;0&#41;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; &#40;repeat from top&#41; <BR>See what I mean. I really apologize for not posting this in a more organized way, but I just cant figure out that formatting stuff to put those boxes up. I did the math correctly, rounding up for the Mint Leaf stress reduction. This was also made assuming that you have nothing more than that stupid Glue in your inventory. <BR> <BR>After you have gotten the 3-stars on all of your hard drills, start this item/drill pattern up. <BR>wk1. {0fa,0st} <BR>NO- {0fa,0st} <BR>LD- {10fa,5st} &#40;20&#41; <BR>wk2. {10fa,5st} &#40;20&#41; <BR>ML- {10fa,3st} &#40;16&#41; <BR>LD- {20fa,8st} &#40;36&#41; <BR>wk3. {20fa,8st} &#40;36&#41; <BR>NO- {0fa,8st} &#40;16&#41; <BR>LD- {10fa,13st} &#40;36&#41; <BR>wk4. {10fa,13st} &#40;36&#41; <BR>ML- {10fa,7st} &#40;24&#41; <BR>LD- {20fa,12st} &#40;44&#41; <BR>TAB- {20fa,0st} &#40;20&#41; <BR> <BR>And repeat this pattern. Virtually no problems with stress/fatigue while doing this. Do this part of the method only after all of the desired hard drills have the 3 stars in them. <BR> <BR>Now that I got the item/drill regimen of the method down, here is what makes this one unique. Whenever your monster cheats or fails, punish them that week, and rest them the following week, feeding Mint Leaves during that week of rest. &#40;I am unable to figure the math on this, due to lack of information that I have concerning cheating and failures&#41; The reason why is because I am just flat-out bored of trying to manipulate the game just to be able to play it. <BR> <BR>As far as battles, errantries, and expeditions go, I&#39;ll stop here and leave it to you on how you decide to further raise your monster. My guidelines here are only after your monster has been fed the Golden &#40;or for really old monsters&#41; or Silver Peach. Below is my most recent example of a monster raised with this method. &#40;hence the challenge I talked about earler in this post&#41; <BR> <BR>Name: Krusty Type: Pink Kato &#40;Kato/Moochi&#41; <BR>Age: 7yr9mo Rank:S  <BR>Lif:543  Ski:999 <BR>Pow:600  Spd:999 <BR>Int:999  Def:420 <BR>Purse:66,500 Wins:33 Losses:0 K.O.&#39;s:24 Techs: &#40;acquired&#41; Licking, Phantom Claw, Tornado Claw, Twister Claw.

 Thanks! I know that there is a die-hard group of people who think you should simply take whatever the game dishes out to you.

 Could you switch this method around, so that you would be doing the light drills while your monster is in it&#39;s earlier stages, and hard drills during it&#39;s prime &#40;so it gets better stat gains&#41;?

 Most definitely. I posted the method like this because I&#39;m used to playing monsters that can get double-digit stat gains during their childhood, like CinderBird, any Mock main, and Centaurs. &#40;these gain the double digit gains on Meditate&#41;  <BR> <BR>But again, you can definitely switch the order of the drilling around. That would be a better case for things like Jokers and other monsters that prosper on things like Shoot and Study drills.

 I was raising up a Tyrant with this the other  <BR>night, and a rather basic thought came to me.  <BR>If you have a monster in your freezer that has  <BR>at least a year or more lifespan left, and it has  <BR>good Int and Lif, &#40;at least 650&#43; in each&#41; send it  <BR>with either Talico or Rovest for their various  <BR>expeditions. If you find enough things &#40;at least  <BR>two Pure Gold, and about $5,000-$6,000 in  <BR>Disk Chips, you can finance this &#40;or any other  <BR>method&#41; for at least a year or more.
