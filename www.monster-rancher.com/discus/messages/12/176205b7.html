<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
My copy of MF2 just came in the mail! wohoo! Keep  <BR>checking the site as I&#39;ll be updating as find out  <BR>new stuff!  <BR>no, I couldn&#39;t wait until it came out here :&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell  <BR> <BR> <BR>Answers <BR> <BR> <BR>Campbell, I want to hear every little detail. By  <BR>the way, can you tell me what I need to play  <BR>import games? I have a Game Shark, but not a mod  <BR>chip or stealth chip &#40;or whatever they care  <BR>called&#41;. I heard somewhere that you can play  <BR>imports with only a game Shark. Do you know if  <BR>this is true? I&#39;m dying to order MF 2, but only if  <BR>I can play it with my playstation as is...  <BR> <BR>-- Eric  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think you can use a Gameshark to play  <BR>imports. I have my PSX chipped. There is a &#39;trick&#39;  <BR>that I&#39;ve heard of though: with some games, what  <BR>you have to do is put in a US game and let the PSX  <BR>title screen come on. Then, you need to switch the  <BR>CD as it loads the game info. To do this, you need  <BR>some way to hold down the button in back of your  <BR>PSX. What this does is use the US CD for the  <BR>country code verification, then it never checks it  <BR>again. I don&#39;t know if it works with all games.  <BR>Here&#39;s what I found out so far:  <BR>I put the Monster Rancher CD in and got a monster  <BR>with a main type &#39;Blob&#39; &#40;that&#39;s just what I&#39;m  <BR>calling it, the names are in Japanese&#41; and a tiger  <BR>sub-type. Not a rare monster, by any means.  <BR>Most of the monsters from the first are still  <BR>there. I&#39;ve seen tigers, dinos &#40;which got a huge  <BR>facelift&#41;, hares, jells, plants, and pixies. The  <BR>new ones I&#39;ve seen are Lemure-looking monsters,  <BR>ones that look like a cross between a dog and  <BR>Eeyore, and the pig guy &#40;he&#39;s a &#39;standard&#39; type  <BR>that you can get in town&#41;. I think Apes are out,  <BR>as the Hare has the farting attack. Some of the  <BR>new attacks are cool... the Jell can turn into a  <BR>cube and &#39;roll&#39; toward the enemy, etc.  <BR>the battle system is very much the same, however  <BR>when you threaten the enemy, it doesn&#39;t  <BR>neccessarily send them all the way back. The hare  <BR>will only send you back to 3rd range, and my blob  <BR>would only send enemies back to the 2nd range.  <BR>There are now 4 different classifications for the  <BR>attacks... the standard damage, %hit, take will  <BR>&#40;now called guts&#41;, and another that I can&#39;t figure  <BR>out. When an attack takes away guts, the amount of  <BR>guts taken is shown on the screen along with the  <BR>damage... Pixies have an attack that does 0 damage  <BR>but takes away guts :&#41;  <BR>In addition to the normal types of round-robin  <BR>battles, you can also enter a single-elimination  <BR>type of battle called a &#39;fresh cup&#39;. Fresh cups  <BR>appear for all classes at once on specific weeks.  <BR>I haven&#39;t figured out their purpose yet. When you  <BR>win a fight, not only do you get money, but your  <BR>monster&#39;s stats go up! I think the stats that go  <BR>up are dependant on what type of monster you have;  <BR>my blob/tiger gets increases to str, spd, and int.  <BR>Working doesn&#39;t give you money anymore, only stat  <BR>increases, but otherwise is the same. it&#39;s now  <BR>just a way to raise loyalty and pass time.  <BR>Training is very different. You monster has 4  <BR>attempts to pass 4 trials, and passing each one  <BR>will give you an increase to two stats. For  <BR>example, I sent my blob to train, and he passed  <BR>the first two trials. He failed the third one on  <BR>his first try, but passed on his second try, and  <BR>then was finished with his 4 weeks of training.  <BR>When you pick training, a &#39;wanted&#39; poster shows  <BR>up, and you can select various monsters from E to  <BR>S-class, which I assume you fight at the end of  <BR>the 4th week.  <BR>Everything&#39;s in 3-D now, the whole ranch, which  <BR>you monster roams about on. The graphics are a bit  <BR>nicer, but not the best, though that&#39;s never where  <BR>the first game&#39;s greatness came from anyway. I&#39;ll  <BR>keep this updated as I find new things.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>Oh man, I can&#39;t wait to hear more. BTW, I&#39;ve seen  <BR>pictures of the Apes in MR2 on at least 2  <BR>websites, so they&#39;re in there.  <BR> <BR>-- Eric  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>Oh, and I thought Hares had the farting attack in  <BR>MR1. I&#39;m almost definate my Evil Hare had it...  <BR> <BR>-- Eric  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>I never really raised too many hares, so maybe  <BR>they did. I&#39;ll let you know as I find other types  <BR>of monsters. I&#39;m also going to attepmt to  <BR>translate the names/types, at least into words I  <BR>can type in here.  <BR>One more thing I forgot: when you win an official  <BR>cup, you don&#39;t always just go up one class. My  <BR>blob entered a D-class cup, and after he won, he  <BR>could compete in C-class and down. It may be that  <BR>winning in ANY battle in a class moves you up, but  <BR>I&#39;m not sure yet.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell  <BR>  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>so is it actually coming out in US or not? I&#39;m not  <BR>about to get a jap game when i can&#39;t speak or read  <BR>jap unless it isn&#39;t coming to america, besides,  <BR>why would i want to buy some creepy chip to run  <BR>the game?  <BR>Anywho... more more more!! I want to know  <BR>everything about the game before i can get it so i  <BR>can have the same title in MR2 that i have in MR.  <BR>So please, gimme more!!  <BR>Oh, and about the Ape thing, even if you did see  <BR>Ape pictures on MR2 sites or pictures of apes  <BR>supposedly in MR2, it coulda been faked.  <BR>oh, and B... Are the Suezo&#39;s really in it? &#40;i know  <BR>the answer but i must ask&#41;, and have they had a  <BR>face lift? Have they got any new attacks? How much  <BR>wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could  <BR>chuck wood?  <BR> <BR>-- Evil McGood  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>If you go to this guys site, he has tonnes of MF2  <BR>screen dumps &#40;Including an Ape&#41;. I&#39;d suppose there  <BR>real, but that is up for debate...  <BR> <BR> <BR>-- Eric  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s another link... this one is to Tecmo&#39;s  <BR>Japanese website. It shows a bunch of the MF2  <BR>monsters &#40;Ape, too!&#41;. BTW, Campbell do you mind if  <BR>I ask how much MF2 cost you? How much was the  <BR>shipping charge and how long did it take?  <BR> <BR>-- Eric  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>OOps, here&#39;s the link  <BR>&#40;Link cannot be shown.&#41; <BR>-- Eric  <BR>&#40;<A HREF="mailto:gausch@cpcuiia.org">gausch@cpcuiia.org</A>&#41;,  <BR>May 14, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>Okay, a few things...  <BR>First, suezos: They are there, but I haven&#39;t seen  <BR>any in battle yet. When you go to training, you  <BR>have to select what monster you want to fight at  <BR>the end. When you select them, you see the picture  <BR>of them as it appears in the breeder&#39;s book. A  <BR>couple were suezos, and in fact, there&#39;s a new  <BR>scorpion-type monster, and I think one of the  <BR>suezos had that monster as a sub-breed because it  <BR>was Suezo with claws! I think the scorpion monster  <BR>is a replacement for the worm, as it has a couple  <BR>worm-like things such as the pierce attack.  <BR>I&#39;m not sure why/when the battles are round-robin  <BR>or single-elim. Some of the normal battles are now  <BR>single-elim as well, which confuses me. I haven&#39;t  <BR>seen an official cup be single-elim yet.  <BR>Training is very interesting now. As I mentione,d  <BR>your monster has 4 week, 4 chances to get through  <BR>4 trials. If it succeeds, it fights the monster  <BR>you chose at the beginning. This is a totally AI  <BR>fight, you con&#39;t control your monster. If your  <BR>monster wins, he gets a new technique and you get  <BR>money. My monster dfeated a D-class opponent after  <BR>one session and earned 2000G, enough to make  <BR>training free!  <BR>A couple things I forgot: I think you can now  <BR>choose the sex of your monster, for the effects of  <BR>messages. When you get a new monster, there is a  <BR>choice you can make &#40;it&#39;s all in Japanese, so I  <BR>have no clue&#41;, and it think it&#39;s M/F. There&#39;s also  <BR>a series of 10 yestions you anser yes or no at the  <BR>begining of a new game, I think the way you answer  <BR>has an efect on your breeding of your monster and  <BR>how they are raised. It would be nice to know what  <BR>they were, though.  <BR>It cost me, all told, about $50. The game itself  <BR>is about $45 &#40;Y4980 &#41; and since my brother shipped  <BR>it over, I just make it an even 50. it took about  <BR>a week.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell  <BR>&#40;<A HREF="mailto:Oriole@capital.net">Oriole@capital.net</A>&#41;,  <BR>May 14, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>Okay, this is the coolest thing ever:  <BR>Your monster will let you know wether it wants to  <BR>work or not. When you select the work and holly  <BR>asks you &#39;do you want to do this work&#39; or  <BR>whatever, the monster will look sad or angry if  <BR>they don&#39;t want to do it! Otherwise, they just  <BR>stand still. I haven&#39;t had them be happy about the  <BR>work yet. If you make them work when they don&#39;t  <BR>want to, chances are you&#39;ll get a worse result.  <BR>There are also various results you can get from  <BR>work. There&#39;s pass and fail, like before, but  <BR>there&#39;s also a &#39;questionable&#39; result, where your  <BR>monster doesn&#39;t quite do it right but still does  <BR>it, and gains a couple points in that stat, and  <BR>&#39;great&#39; result, where you monster does excellently  <BR>and gets a bonus in that stat.  <BR>Also, there are LOTS more CD&#39;s that you need  <BR>permission for. Out of about 10 I&#39;ve tried, 4 have  <BR>been locked. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re all locked in  <BR>the same way they were in the first one, but  <BR>possibly you need to be a certain level breeder to  <BR>unlock some of them.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell  <BR>&#40;<A HREF="mailto:oriole@capital.net">oriole@capital.net</A>&#41;,  <BR>May 15, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>well... it might be that you were just lucky  <BR>enough to have 4 rare monster CD&#39;s  <BR> <BR>-- Evil McGood  <BR>&#40;<A HREF="mailto:Squirdude@aol.com">Squirdude@aol.com</A>&#41;, May  <BR>15, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>checked out tunnel rat&#39;s site&#91;the geocities site&#93;  <BR>and it looks like most of his freezes come from  <BR>the &#34;book&#34;. 408 monsters! b, this is how dense i  <BR>am - is this playable on my existing playstation,  <BR>or am i going to have to get new hardware?  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo  <BR>&#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve <BR>.com</A>&#41;, May  <BR>15, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>Evil: I HOPE I have 4 rare CD&#39;s! That would be  <BR>great! Only downside is figuring out how ot get  <BR>the &#39;rare&#39; monsters in the game! ouch...  <BR>Torey: all you have to do is get your current PSX  <BR>chipped. If done right, you&#39;ll have no harmful  <BR>side effects and it will play imported, copied,  <BR>and normal games just fine.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell  <BR>&#40;<A HREF="mailto:Oriole@capital.net">Oriole@capital.net</A>&#41;,  <BR>May 16, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>So I was looking at Tunnelrat&#39;s screen dumps of  <BR>the monster cards, and I noticed that the monsters  <BR>have a class &#40;E through Any class&#41;. when you  <BR>create monsters in the Shrine, are they always E  <BR>class? Do you need to be a C class breeder to  <BR>generate a C class monster in the Shrine? If that  <BR>is the case, perhaps that&#39;s why so many CDs need  <BR>to be unlocked. What is your Breeder rank now,  <BR>Campbell?  <BR> <BR>-- Eric  <BR>&#40;<A HREF="mailto:gausch@cpcuiia.org">gausch@cpcuiia.org</A>&#41;,  <BR>May 17, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m assuming that that&#39;s right... ATM I&#39;m a &#39;D&#39;  <BR>class breeder, but I&#39;ve only shrined out E-class  <BR>monsters &#40;though I&#39;ve only used about 10 CD&#39;s as  <BR>well&#41;. I&#39;m working on getting a monster up the  <BR>ranks right now to test it out. The game seems to  <BR>be a bit harder now; It&#39;s extremely hard to raise  <BR>the monster&#39;s loyalty. It doesn&#39;t just go up when  <BR>you send them off to work or whatever, it depends  <BR>on how you treat them. Right now my monster&#39;s  <BR>completely spoiled and only has 50 loyalty. I&#39;m  <BR>sure part of this has to do with the fact that I  <BR>can&#39;t read japanese as well. So yes, I&#39;m assuming  <BR>that you have to be a certain rank of breeder to  <BR>unlcok certain, more powerful or rare, monsters.  <BR>There&#39;s another new thing that happened too. once  <BR>in a while, your monster fights YOU. It&#39;s very  <BR>strange... a &#39;warning&#39; flashes on the screen when  <BR>your monster is about to hit you, and if you press  <BR>the right buttons, a &#39;chance&#39; follows where you  <BR>can land a blow yourself. I&#39;m not sure what effect  <BR>winning or losing has yet.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell  <BR>&#40;<A HREF="mailto:oriole@capital.net">oriole@capital.net</A>&#41;,  <BR>May 17, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>Wait until B figures out how to beat it with a  <BR>hammer, it&#39;ll have 100 loyality and win everytime,  <BR>or ELSE !  <BR> <BR>-- Just Alex  <BR>&#40;<A HREF="mailto:aka_cp@hotmail.com">aka_cp@hotmail.com</A>&#41;,  <BR>May 17, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------- <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>ya know.. that sounds exactly like how my son  <BR>would do it... beat it until it obeys...

 this is the &#34;kickoff&#34; post for b campbell&#39;s board, all right, but it was not the first post on the board.  there were several &#34;preseason&#34; posts before this, mostly chatter about the establishment of the board, and how he was going to try to get mf2 from japan.  those were about a month or so before this one.

 Wow. It&#39;s amazing to be able to look back on things this way. Especially with thnigs that are so commonplace now, that were such &#39;amazing&#39; things. Like the &#39;blob/tiger&#39;, whoch I&#39;m assuming is a Frozen Gaboo. And the monster fighting _you_ &#40;playing the &#39;sparring&#39; game&#41;. The question you answer when you get a monster &#40;do you want to keep it?&#41;. Spoiling the monster rotton, and wondering why its loyalty wasn&#39;t going up. <BR> <BR>&#42;starts singing &#39;Those Were The Days&#39;&#42;
