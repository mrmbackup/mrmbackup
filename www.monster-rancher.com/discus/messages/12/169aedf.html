<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
well, last night&#39;s discussion with golem man &#91;you know for all the abuse i gave him i hope he&#39;s truly found something new!&#93; got me thinking about the myths of mr2. nothing has had quite the staying power of the leviathan, wild, or werewolf from mr1, but there have been a few erroneous ideas that crop up regularly, are refuted, then come back again. here are the top 5 that i remember:  <BR>1&#93; you can capture enemy monsters ... this has had the most lives. i just read a post yesterday from someone who insists you can get enemy monsters without a gameshark. somehow, though, the method is never quite revealed...  <BR>2&#93; nuts oil/mint leaf decreases lifespan ... well, you give it to your monster like a drug, and it has a visible effect, like a drug. therefore it must be a drug, and drugs reduce lifespan, right? well, no. everyone who has reported a 10&#43; year old monster they have raised&#91;including golem man, btw&#93; has reported using both of these items in raising that monster. to me, that&#39;s proof enough.  <BR>3&#93; how you answer the alien question at the start of the game affects when/whether you get metalners ... it seemed like it should, and i believed this for awhile, but its clear&#91;as clear as a night in september, in fact&#93; to me now that it didn&#39;t. in fact, i&#39;m wondering, now that i&#39;ve started getting retirement warnings again, whether my answer to the other questions really did have any effect, or if its all just random.  <BR>4&#93; all breeds are unlocked when you become a master no.  <BR>5&#93; the monsters you get off your cds change as you unlock new breeds ... this has not been disproved so much as been abandoned. this one scares me the most, because i catalogued my cd collection when i only had slightly more than half the breeds unlocked, and haven&#39;t gone back to check those that were unlocked since i&#39;ve now unlocked all but beaclon. if enough people say this, my collection will be the proof or disproof, and i&#39;ll hate having to do all the recataloging.  <BR>any others i&#39;ve missed?  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo March 24, 2000  <BR> <BR> <BR>Good Post Torey &#40;as always&#41;. Gator, I agree with number 6, but in my humble opinion they are the best two to train. Perhaps I need to have a more open mind to raising other species...but after I finish MR1!!  <BR> <BR>-- Tony March 24, 2000.  <BR> <BR>How about the Phoenix returning?  <BR> <BR>-- Lisa Shock March 25, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>thanx, lisa - i forgot about that one. after i retired and saved my phoenix, i went back and played him out until he flew away. just as he disappeared over the horizon, a light appeared that put me in mind of the death shooting star. so i guess he doesn&#39;t come back, although i haven&#39;t waited the 100 yrs yet. btw, is it true he does come back in the japanese version?  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo March 25, 2000.  <BR> <BR>It is believed that it does return in the Japanese version. &#40;Maybe it likes cigarettes.&#41; Someone, an early contributer, posted something about his phoenix returning. Check the archives, either he was spreading a rumor &#40;we didn&#39;t hear much from him after this&#41; or it&#39;s true &#40; he posted the announcement pretty early &#91;October&#93; to have gotten the feather and then ranched for 100 years in the US version&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- Lisa Shock March 25, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have to confess to the report of the returning Pheonix. I was very new and was having fun. No, the Pheonix NEVER comes back, and I doubt that it does in the Jap version either. THe thread is in the Pheonix Files and is called &#40;duh!!&#41; MY PHEONIX CAM BACK!! It is TOTAL bull shit. Trust me. I made the whole thing up...  <BR> <BR>-- Jimmy Cooper &#40;<A HREF="mailto:duckman18@hotmail.com">duckman18@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, March 25, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Frikkerfrak-DOES NOT EXIST. This may be somewhat obscure but I&#39;ve seen about five posts about it.  <BR> <BR>-- Zack F March 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR>what is frikkerfrak?  <BR> <BR>-- trey March 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a taunt post put up by a transient; the werewolf of MR2. One person trying to create a rumor of a new monster. I&#39;d rather we all just ignore it, and not waste our time on this person.  <BR> <BR>-- Lisa Shock March 26, 2000.

 got another one for you. i heard lately that if you get a Jill and let it sit for 10 months then send it to errantry for 10 straight months without rest and repeat twice. you can combine your extremely tired Jill with a Golem and get a Sasquatch. Please tell me that this is complete BS. I don&#39;t believe it but hey I&#39;ve been wrong in the past.

 That&#39;s another fictional method for a monster that does not exist!
