GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  <BR> <BR>Your monster must be at least C rank. &#40;with one exception&#41; <BR>Your monster must have at least 50 fame.  <BR>Your monster must be on the ranch on the day that the explorer comes calling. &#91;in other words, if you have an expedition monster, the time to get it out of the freezer is the week before the invitation arrives - the week of is too late; you will not get the chance&#93;  <BR>Your monster must have a certain amount of life points; this varies by expedition.  <BR>You need to go on the first Kawrea adventure to unlock the other ventures. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>THE EXPEDITIONS:  <BR> <BR>October 1 - the place - parepare jungle. the adventurer - kavaro. Kavaro is the least picky of all the adventurers; any lif over 140 is enough for him to show up. You need to go on the first kawrea adventure for this event to be unlocked. marquee items here are the sheath and the gold peach.  <BR> <BR>February 1 - the place - torles mountains. the adventurer - rovest. Rovest may require more than 140 lif; if so, i am not certain whether it is 210 or 280, however. You need to go on the first kawrea adventure for this event to be unlocked. Marquee items here are the strong glue, the big footprint and paradoxine.  <BR> <BR>June 1 - the place - kawrea volcano. the adventurer - dr. talico. This is really two expeditions:  <BR> <BR>1&#41; The first is before the volcano explodes, and is easy to get invited to. &#91;very minimal requirements, you must have a trainer rank of 2, and your monster be at D&#93;. there is only one path to take, and you could find the phoenix feather there. You must go on this adventure to unlock all of the other adventures. <BR> <BR>2&#41; After the volcano explodes, your monster must be at B rank, there is a 280 minimum lif requirement for the invitation to show up. marquee items are the feather and the joker mask.  <BR> <BR>&#91;a more complete list of items available at each expedition is found in the &#34;Schedule of Annual Events&#34;, elsewhere in this FAQ&#93; <BR> <BR>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS:  <BR> <BR>1&#93; The more int you have, in general, the better the items you will find. however, there is randomness, and stupid monsters will find good items occasionally.  <BR> <BR>2&#93; Life points are measured in units of 70. 140 thru 209 will start you with 140 life points; 210-279 will get you 210; 280-349 yields 280, etc.  <BR> <BR>3&#93; Each move you make takes away 1 life point; each trip inside a building takes away ~10; trying to knock over obstacles takes away -5. According to Dark Phoenix, Expedition: &#43;70 Fatigue / &#43;0 Stress &#40;may vary if monster has negative Life Points when it reaches Base Camp. Need to do more research&#41;. You likely lose additional lifespan if you dont get back to the base before your life point meter gets to -10;  it is not known if any stress also occurs. <BR> <BR>4&#93; Your monster should be at very well, and at minimal stress before going on an expedition.  <BR> <BR>5&#93; Unless you dont believe in resetting, save the week before the expedition so, if you dont get anything good, you can reset and try again.  <BR> <BR>6&#93; You only can hold a certain number of items in your cache; it is the same items closet as during the game. so it is a good idea to sell off extraneous matter before an expedition.  NOTE:  If you have a full cache, and find a useless item, you can discard the recently discovered item by pressing the triangle button. <BR> <BR>7&#93; Unlike in mr1, your monster will never get lost inside a building.  <BR> <BR>8&#93; Unlike in mr1, clearing an obstacle does not clear it for future expeditions; just for the one you are on. <BR> <BR>9&#93;  However, if you find a secret path, that path remains open for all future expeditions. <BR> <BR>10&#93;  The expedition screen gives you a x/y coordinate readout of where you are at all times. <BR> <BR>11&#93;  The &#34;O&#34; key allows you to change perspective of the expedition, which can allow you to see things that might otherwise be hidden behind objects. <BR> <BR>12}  As to the significance of the objects, see the items list, or the topic &#34;How to Unlock All 38&#34;, elsewhere in this FAQ.  Just a small reminder:  you will not find the strong glue at Torles unless you have already put together a duck doll from the fun cans. <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="-2"><B>Thanks to: Manfred</B></FONT>
