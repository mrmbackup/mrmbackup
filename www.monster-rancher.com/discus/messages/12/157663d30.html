 So for awhile now my game has been freezing while  <BR>viewing monster cards.The music keeps going,but it  <BR>just continues to show the back of the monsters  <BR>card it stopped on. I can&#39;t pause or back out or  <BR>anything.It&#39;s done this before, but after waiting  <BR>5 minutes or reinserting the disc it would  <BR>work.Ever since last summer i&#39;ve been playing on  <BR>my PS3 so reinserting the disc is different,you  <BR>can&#39;t just open it like the ps1 you have to take  <BR>the disc out.I don&#39;t think it matters about the  <BR>amount of cards, because i have about 80 cards, my  <BR>little brother has 20, and my oldest brother has  <BR>much more, and it freezes for all of us. What is  <BR>also strange is that it always freezes around the  <BR>same spot, Katos,Suezos,and everything in between  <BR>is what i can&#39;t view. Maybe it&#39;s a certain scratch  <BR>on the disc? My real question is Is anyone else  <BR>having this problem? Any solutions of why it&#39;s  <BR>doing it and how to fix it?  I&#39;m looking forward  <BR>to the replies.

 Scratch on the disc is all I can think of. Try holding the disc up in front of a light and looking through it. If you see any spots where light is shining through the disc, that&#39;s a spot with missing aluminum &#40;missing information&#41; and it cannot be repaired. If no light is coming through, then there&#39;s a chance that resurfacing will fix it. A used record shop should be able to resurface it for about $2.

 Alright thanks for the help. While we&#39;re at it  <BR>though i have something else to say. The only  <BR>reason i started playing on my PS3 was because it  <BR>was more convenient and Monster Rancher 2 would  <BR>freeze at the loading screen when playing.Mostly  <BR>in battles or at the 1P vs 2P mode.It&#39;d take 5 to  <BR>10 minutes if it even did end up working.And it  <BR>happened most of the time with a battle containing  <BR>a Jell.However when I played on my PS3 it was just  <BR>fine&#40;besides this card problem&#41;. It wasn&#39;t the PS1  <BR>i don&#39;t think because all the other games were  <BR>fine.So just a little something to say to see if  <BR>anyone has an idea. Thanks again

 I&#39;ve been trying to get the cards to work. My game  <BR>does have a few scratches on the bottom but it&#39;s  <BR>most likely from the game spinning, none of them  <BR>are that deep or even noticeable unless under  <BR>light. However on the top of the disc with the  <BR>graphics and art on, their are a few black and  <BR>blue&#40;the same colors as the monsters on the game  <BR>disc are&#41; speckles on. I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re  <BR>supposed to be their, but i think they&#39;ve been  <BR>their for awhile now even before the problem was  <BR>this bad. I&#39;m going to try and play the game on my  <BR>ps1 and see how things turn out, and then after  <BR>maybe playing on a different power outlet&#40;I really  <BR>doubt that&#39;ll make a difference, but I gotta try  <BR>all the possibilities&#41;.I&#39;ll check with ya guys  <BR>later with an update.

 Idk if you guys want me to edit the posts or not  <BR>but. <BR>UPDATE: I played the game on my PS1 and i can view  <BR>the cards! It lags a little after a couple but it  <BR>works unlike playing on my playstation 3. It&#39;s not  <BR>the same file, it&#39;s a previous less updated one i  <BR>have on my PS3 if that matters, I&#39;ve only gotten  <BR>about 10 more monster cards since. Is it possible  <BR>to  <BR>send memory from my ps3 to a ps3 memory card? Like  <BR>in reverse?

 There&#39;s a device called a memory card reader that lets you use PS1 and PS2 cards on a PS3.
