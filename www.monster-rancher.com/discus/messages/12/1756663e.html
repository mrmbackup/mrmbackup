NOTE:due to the fact that I didn&#39;t save a copy, but printed it, I was FORCED to do a good deed for my friend Nate Railsback to re type it...Nate, you HAD to ask for it.This t= takes a really long time to re-type guys. Damn my scanner for not being able to copy this!!  Nate, you owe me a big one. I would like my payment in cash, no credit cards are excepted. &#40;Just kidding...I think.  Actually, think of this as a late/early birthday present.&#41; Also lisa, I don&#39;t know how to make a table, so please forgive me when I print the stats...I&#39;ll try to print them on one line, if it helps, then you can teach me to make a table. Also, I&#39;ll try to buy MRBC off GameStop when I have the time to pay you back for the space this will take. <BR> <BR>Well, since I&#39;ve never seen anything on Bajarls &#40;except for people asking how to get them, and since you NEVER fight one in the game, I thought I&#39;d give a little rundown of what the little guys are like based on my own Boxer Bajarl, Balrog &#40;since I used a GameShark to turn him into one...he has the statistical set-up of a pure Bajarl, so this is a straight analysis.&#41; <BR> <BR>First off, maybe I shouldn&#39;t have named him Balrog...these things are real pipsqueeks, smaller thatn anything else in the game.  Plus, it uses all the these cute little squeaks and mini groans that don&#39;t sound at ALL characteristic of the SF2 bruiser I named him after.  Bajarls DO pump up in the ring &#40;alot like Ghosts during their punching attacks, but not as big&#41;, and the pot shrinks down to a little belt-clip.  he didn&#39;t take too long to get attached to me, though, which was good &#40;not particularly disobedient, but he was still asking for Grease even when he was Best natured and 6 years old&#41;...but the thing that really took me by surprise was the LIFESPAN!  I&#39;m serious when I say that these things have a comparible lifespanto Kato, and maybe evin in the range of Wracky or Mock when raised really well.  Mine collected all of the teckniques abailible &#40;that ain&#39;t easy...see below. <I>This ain&#39;t easy...see above</I>&#41; and it STILL lived out to seven years &#40;it hasn&#39;t died yet, but it&#39;s in the freezer and fairly close to death.  Exact age:6 years 11 monsths 2 weeks.&#41;  this thing was over 3 years old before it hit maturity! <BR> <BR>As for stats, the Bajarl gets high-quality Guts Regeneration &#40;at about a 7:5 ratio between it and Zuums&#41;.  It&#39;s pretty average in all defensive stats &#40;Defense, Life, and Speed&#41;.  It gets great skill boosts and Power boosts on par with Durahan or Golem &#40;consistant 20&#39;s off Hard Drills&#41;, but its Intelligence is pretty poor.  I used lots of battles&#40;with my own little technique for Controlling Post-Battle Stat Gains&#41; to boost tis up to where it is now...take a look: <BR> <BR>Balrog- Boxer Bajarl &#40;Bajarl/???&#41; <BR> <BR>Life:780, Power:892, Intelligence:463, Skill, 850,  Speed 634, Defense 704 <BR> <BR>&#42;Third generation, descended from a fully raised Beaclon/Bajarl and a brand-new Magic Bajarl slated off MR1 <BR> <BR>Trashed the M4, and got into the Hall of Fame by being my first monster to beat Most &#40;But only by 2%!&#41;.  Of course, he was also my first monster to FACE Most, but I don&#39;t know if my other Hall of Famers could have done it. <BR> <BR>&#42;Learned all techniques. <BR> <BR>And as for the last one...let&#39;s show the people why that a real accomplishment &#40;I will pass up a comment here.  Sorry for the bickering, but a PSYCIC&#39;s gotta do what a PSYCIC&#39;s gotta do. I haven&#39;t lost my PSYCICness&#41;.  You ccan fine the Bajarl&#39;s move list at the Monster Haven, but here&#39;s how the Teck Chains broke down: <BR> <BR>Tech Chains: <BR> <BR>Straight &#40;Heavy&#41;-&#62;Magic punch&#40;Heavy&#41;-&#62;Mystic Punch&#40;Good Special&#41;-. Mystic Combo &#40;Good Special&#41;. <BR> <BR>Straight&#40;Heavy&#41;-&#62;Hook&#40;Heavy&#41;-&#62;1-2 Hook&#40;Heavy&#41;-&#62;1-2 Smash &#40;Good H.&#41; <BR> <BR>Uppercut &#40;Sharp&#41;-&#62;1-2-Uppercut&#40;sharp&#41; <BR> <BR>Magic Pot &#40;Evil Spec.&#41;-&#62;Mystic Pot&#40;Evil Special&#41;-&#62;Miracle Pot &#40;E.S.&#41; <BR> <BR>Left Jab, Right Jab, Bajarl Beam, first to are Basic, third is Special, AHHHHHHH!!!! <BR> <BR>No crossover techniques thank GOD &#40; or I would be typing just that much longer&#41;.  I really wish he would have started with more then 4 moves...oh well.  Finally, on tho the battle strategies &#40;This section was supposed to appear in his next B.S.F.V.M. post&#41;... <BR> <BR>&#42;Bajarl:You have two basic ways to go with this monster:  make it a Good/Best Natured, Power oriented monster...or an Evil, intelligence oriented monster &#40;what the &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; does does oriented mean anyway?&#41; &#40;Nate--which would require a Jaba or a Bajar/Joker, because the pure sucks at Intelligence&#41;.  Both ways are kind of difficult...with the Int-orientation, you&#39;ll only have four moves to work with, and you;ll probably want at least 500 Power to be able to deliver some minor physical attacks.  But trust me, a Bajarl with maxed out int and Skill is NATSTY, considering that Magic Pot DRAINS HP &#40;I.E. steals it from them and adds it to you, for RPG newbies&#41; with a B Rank force and D rank accuracy for only 35 guts, Mystic Pot steals guts themselves with a 45 initial cost, and Miricle Pot steals BOTH for 60 Guts cost &#40;but only with E-rank accuracy, so be careful&#41;.  Plus, Bajarl Beam is good for C Force and Withering, and A Accuracy for 35 Guts.  More likely though, you&#39;ll want to work with a a normal Bajarl &#40;since the Jaba also gets below average, all around defensive stats&#41; that should follow the Path of Good.  Bajarls don&#39;t hget ^#92;ANY withering or Hit Thechs, but the Left and Right Javs should make up for the absense of &#34;true&#34; Hit Tecks.  Uppercut and 1-2-uppercut are its only Sharp moves, too, but they&#39;re very good &#40;the second one C Force and WB accuracy  are good for taking down Speedy enemies...or rather, taking them UP.&#41;  Hook is NASTY, it seems to be alot more powerful and accurate than the game says it is &#40;B Force, E Accuracy&#41;, and it only costs25 Guts...1-2-Hook is is pretty good &#40;ecxept A force for thirty&#41;, but 1-2- Smash &#40;with S force, e accuracy and C Withering for 36 guts. should only be used againdst the slowest, toughest Tanks, if you even want to BOTHER with a move that&#39;s FOURTH in a Tech Chain.  Mafic Punch  and Mystic Pnch are both excellent moves with moderate costs &#40;26 and 34&#41; and awesome graphics, they lead to teh kick @$$ Mystic combo, with stats of B/B/D/C/ 39 cost that is well worth the effoert required to get it.  Tactically, there&#39;s not much to fighting as a well-raised Bajarl.  Its high Power, Skill, and Gust Regen,&#40;paired with inexpensive overall moves&#41; allows it to grind the enemy anyway you see fit.  Use Hea. Techs against Tanks and Sharp Techs against Speed Demons, and you&#39;ll easily tackle them.  The evil little Pot techs can leave any Tank hating your guts, but they really fall apart against Speedsters, so use Bajarl Beam on them ASAP before they pierce your weak defenses.  The normal Bajarl should also have the defensive stats to handle monst attacks moderatly well, so you don&#39;t have to worry about any sort of unusual positioning...but you&#39;re but you&#39;re opponent might want to. The main problem with Bajarls is that until they reach B Rank, or work on their Straight punches, they&#39;re limited to ONLY mid-range attacks, so you can trash any novice by simply staying away from there.  If you&#39;re a Speedster, then remaining right in thier face works well, because they can only try for Hook &#40;WHIFF&#41;  or push you back into far range where they can only tickle you with Bajarl Beam, miss you with the drains, or go for a Mystic Punch &#40;Which is actually something to watch out for&#41;.  With Tanks, your only hope for survival is to keep as far away as possible and hope the Bajarl hasn&#39;t learned Mystic Punch, while trying to stomp it into the ground ASAP.  Since the Bajarl can&#39;t Whither too well, a Guts Miser strategy is pretty workable against it. <BR> <BR>If you have any further questions, feel free to ask! <BR> <BR>--Nate Railsback &#40;ChimeraMan101@aol.com&#41;, February 29, 2000 <BR> <BR>Nate, don&#39;t worry, all those comments are just me trying to be funny, you put a lot of work into this, more than I did, and I came out unscathed except for an hour and a half older and a minor headache, but the most important thing is that I kept my promise to you.  All hail Lays potato chips!
