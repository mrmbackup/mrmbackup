I&#39;ll be re-posting the stat gains of every monster after calculating them myself.  It&#39;ll be on a 1-5 scale. <BR>5= 20 on a HD, 14 or 15 on LD <BR>4= 19 or 20 on HD, 11-14 on LD <BR>3= 14-17 on HD, 8-11 on LD <BR>2= 11-14 on HD, 6-9 on LD <BR>1= 6-10 on HD, 4-7 on LD <BR> <BR><B>PAL players, please note that there is no &#39;Swim Bug&#39; in your game, so ignore the swimgain number.</B> <BR> <BR>Second Prime has the same numbers as prime, only the gain is -1. So a 4 on a LD is 10 - 13 instead of 11 - 14. <BR> <BR>The phase right before prime and right after prime are value -1. So a 5 in power would become a 4 in power. I believe the phases right before and right after those phases are value-1 then gain -1. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know the ranges for the first two and last two phases or when a stat hits a value of 0.

Complete potential of every monster  <BR>Because of the swim drill bug I did some extra work on the defense.  <BR>The best monster is based on stats, lifespan, lifestages &#40;longer prime better&#41;, guts, and my personal opinion. Worst is based on the same thing.  <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Main/Sub</TD><TD>Lif</TD><TD>Pow</TD><TD>Int</TD><TD>Skl</TD><TD>Spd</TD><TD>Def &#40;swim&#41;</TD><TD>Total
