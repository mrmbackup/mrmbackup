<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF='mailto:Darkburner8790@aol.com'>The D</A></B> on <B>Wednesday, May 29, 2002 - 03:24 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
<B>The D’s Method</B> <BR> <BR> <BR><B>REASON FOR THIS METHOD:</B> <BR> <BR>	I wrote this method for people who are having a hard time reaching S-class or the Major-4. This method is for people who have patience and do not mind reloading and saving a lot. Also who do not mind spending close to $175,000 - $250,000 on their monsters. This method is an easy to follow method which only requires you to be a novice to advanced player. <BR> <BR><B>NEEDS FOR THIS METHOD:</B> <BR> <BR>	You will need a sculpture, Gemni Pot, a Lump of Ice, Fire Stone&#42; , and you will need a golden peach. You can also use a Silver Peach &#40;optional&#41;. You will need the will to train your monster to it’s fullest potential. Although you will need around $250,000 dollars to raise your monster to it’s fullest. This method will work at it’s best with a round monster like Pheonix, Durahan, Mocchi, Zuum. But don’t get discouraged if you don’t have these monsters. I just said it will work best with them, but it will work great with any monster. Your monster will also have to either tolerate tablets or like them. These are the basic needs for this method. And just remember you NEED patience because you will probably need to reload a lot depending on your monsters Nature. <BR> <BR>&#42; Fire Stone is optional because when I raised my monster using this method I did not use one. But if you feel that you should use one feel free to. <BR> <BR><B>PARAMETER:</B> <BR> <BR>	This method has a couple of parameters also: <BR> <BR>1.	Do not send your monster on expeditions. <BR>2.	You will not battle until 3rd stage. <BR>3.	Do not send monster to errantry until 2nd stage. <BR>4.	Do not feed your monster Potatoes. &#40; Even if it is it’s favorite food. &#41; <BR>5.	Do not let your monster get injured or KO’d by anyone.&#40;If this happens reload your game&#41; <BR>6.	DO NOT USE DRUGS! <BR> <BR>These are the basic parameters. <BR> <BR><B>WORKINGS:</B> <BR> <BR>	This is how this method will work. You will train your monster only on the 3rd and 4th week of each month. During the 1st and 2nd week you will train a TEST monster. It does not matter what the test monster is as long as you don’t mind that the test monster won’t live long at all. So first go pick a primary monster and a test monster. Go freeze the primary monster and take the test monster to the farm. It does not matter how you train him, just do it. Then on the third week go unfreeze the primary monster. <BR> <BR><B>MATH ON THINGS USED IN THIS METHOD:</B> <BR> <BR>Powder = &#43;5 Fatigue, - 24 form <BR>Candy = -2 Stress, &#43;10 Form, &#43;1 Spoil <BR>Mint Leaf = Stress reduced by 50%, -5 form, -2 Spoil <BR>Nuts Oil = -28 Fatigue, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear <BR>Smoked Snake = -10 Spoil, &#43;20 Fear, - 10 Form <BR>Magic Banana = ? &#40;&#43;1 week of life span or -1 week of life span.&#41; <BR>Tablet =  <BR>Liked : -15 stress, &#43;3 Spoil, &#43;2 Fear, &#43;3 Form <BR>Neutral: -13 stress, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;2 Fear, &#43;3 Form <BR>Rest = -35 Fatigue, -7 stress <BR>Light Drill =  <BR>Success: &#43;10 Fatigue, &#43;5 stress <BR>Great: &#43;5 Fatigue, &#43;9 stress <BR>Cheat: ? <BR>Hard Drill =  <BR>Success: &#43;15 Fatigue, &#43;12 Stress <BR>Great: ? <BR>Cheat: ? <BR>Errantry = &#40;each week&#41; &#43;18 Fatigue, &#43;7 Stress <BR>Battle = ? &#40;From what I’ve heard, Battles take away 3 weeks of lifespan per battle.&#41; <BR> <BR>These are the Items/training/battles that we will be performing. <BR> <BR><B>PROCEDURE:</B> <BR> <BR>	Finally the real method. <BR> <BR><B>Key:</B> <BR> <BR>Powder = Powder <BR>Candy = Candy <BR>Mint Leaf = ML <BR>Nuts Oil = NO <BR>Magic Banana = MB <BR>Tablet = Tablet <BR>Rest = Rest <BR>Light Drill = LD <BR>Hard Drill = HD <BR>Battle = Battle <BR>&#40;Errantry was left out because it won’t be seen as a procedure, it will be seen as an explaining in a paragraph.&#41; <BR> <BR><B>STAGE 1: Baby</B> <BR> <BR>1.	Do not let your monster fail/cheat at any time for any reason. If so then reload. <BR>2.	If your monster get’s to fat or skinny, feed it a Powder or candy in place of none. <BR>3.	Keep your monster at EVEN style with smoked snake in place of none. <BR>4.	Train in skill through out all of stage 1 because there is no hard drill for it later on. <BR>5.	Save every time that you pull out your primary monster for training. <BR>6.	Just follow the method and you’ll be fine. <BR> <BR> <BR><B>NOTE:</B> Works of the Magic Banana: <BR>The Magic Banana is an item that you can buy at the market. It either increases or decreases your life span. If your monsters loyalty decreases by 10 you got an extra week of life. If loyalty increases you will loose one week of lifespan. So what you want is the -10 loyalty. If your loyalty does anything else than decrease by 10, reload. <B>SAVE BEFORE YOU GIVE YOUR MONSTER A MB</B>. Wait until your monsters loyalty is around 80 or higher. Until it’s loyalty is at 80, give it a candy/none in place of MB. Once you do have 80&#43; loyalty, don’t let your monsters loyalty drop below 70. If it does get this low, stop with the MB’s for a little while. Give it a MB every other week. Although this method raises your loyalty pretty fast. <BR> <BR><B>1st month:</B> <BR> <BR>Week 1 = Test monster <BR>Week 2 = Test monster <BR>Week 3 = MB/none, LD&#40;skill&#41;       &#40;&#43;10 Fatigue, &#43;10 Stress&#41; = 10 Fatigue, 10 Stress &#40;no life loss&#41; <BR>Week 4 = NO, LD		&#40;&#43;10 Fatigue, &#43;10 Stress, -28 fatigue&#41; = 0, 20&#40;no life loss&#41; <BR>Feeding = Tablet		&#40;-13/15 stress&#41; = 0, 7/5  &#40;no life loss&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR><B>NOTE:</B> From what I’ve read, I believe that if stress &#40;x 2&#41; &#43; fatigue both add up to 70 or above there is life loss. So as you can see there is no life loss above. From this point on I will stop putting “no life loss” in parenthesis and assume that you know when there is life loss and when there is not. You may notice that I changed the amount of stress that training gives your monster. I multiplied it by 2. &#40; Correction given by Lisa &#41; <BR> <BR><B>Agent = &#40;Fatigue, Stress, other&#41;</B> <BR> <BR><B>2nd month:</B> <BR> <BR>Week 1 = Test monster <BR>Week 2 = Test monster <BR>Week 3 = none&#42;/NO, LD		&#40;&#43;10, &#43;10,&#41; = 10, 17/15 <BR>Week 4 = ML, LD		&#40;&#43;10, &#43;10,- 50% stress&#41; = 20, 12/13 <BR>Feeding = Tablet		&#40;-13/15 stress&#41; = 20, 0 <BR> <BR>&#42; Every other time you come across this, give him a NO. That should take care of the Fatigue build up. <BR> <BR> <BR>Repeat these 2 month until you reach the end of stage 1. If you don’t know when you have reached the end of stage 1, than go look at the thread “Monsters life stages”, or what I usually do is I measure my monsters height. I see how tall he is on the house. Then I make a mark in my head where he is at. Then when he gets bigger I know he is in Stage 2. Also, if your monster just got into stage 2, instead of freezing him on the first week, rest him, so he can be ready for stage 2. Then freeze him and get your test monster for the 2nd week, freeze it again and get your primary monster. Then just follow the method from there. <BR> <BR> <BR><B>STAGE 2: Adolescent</B> <BR> <BR>	This is the stage where you will really start training your monster. Here he will go to errantrys and train in Hard drills.  <BR> <BR>1.	Don’t let your monster fail or cheat at any time. <BR>2.	Keep style at even with smoked snakes in place of none. <BR>3.	If your monster gets to skinny or fat, feed it a candy or powder in place of none. <BR>4.	Work on your best stat because later on in Stage 3 you will be doing your worst stat for best results. <BR>5.	If loyalty drops to low, stop feeding it MB’s until loyalty is at 80&#43; again. <BR>6.	Follow this and you should be fine. <BR> <BR> <BR><B>1st month: MB month</B> <BR> <BR>Week 1: Test monster <BR>Week 2: Test monster <BR>Week 3: MB, HD		&#40;&#43;15, &#43;24&#41; = 15, 24 <BR>Week 4: NO, HD		&#40;&#43;15, &#43;24, - 28 fatigue&#41; = 2, 48 <BR>Feeding: Tablet		&#40;-13/15 stress&#41; = 2, 35/33 <BR> <BR><B>2nd month: Rest month</B> <BR> <BR>Week 1: Test monster <BR>Week 2: Test monster <BR>Week 3: ML, HD		&#40;&#43;15, &#43;24, - 50% stress&#41; = 17, 27/28 <BR>Week 4: none &#42;/ML, rest		&#40;-33 fatigue, -7 stress&#41; = 0, 20/21 <BR>Feeding: Tablet		&#40;-13/15 stress&#41; = 0, 7/5 <BR> <BR>&#42; Every other time this comes around give your monster a ML to reduce stress to minimal.  <BR> <BR>Follow this during stage 2 until Stage 3. You should start errantry here. If you send your monster on an errantry make sure he passes every part of the errantry and he learned a technique. If not reload. Also, only send it on errantrys after the Rest month. Send him right after your feeding, on the 1st week, instead of freezing him.. So basically, you will have your primary monster out for about 2 month straight. &#40; 1.Errantry, 2. Errantry month.&#41; When you come back that month do this: <BR> <BR><B>Errantry month:</B> <BR> <BR>Week 1: NO, rest		&#40;&#43;72, &#43;28, - 33 fatigue, - 7 stress, -28 fatigue&#41; = 11, 21 <BR>Week 2: ML, HD		&#40;&#43;15, &#43;24, - 50% stress&#41; = 26, 22 <BR>Week 3: NO, HD		&#40;&#43;15, &#43;24, - 28 fatigue &#41; = 13, 46 <BR>Week 4: ML, rest		&#40;- 33 fatigue, - 7 stress, - 50% stress&#41; = 0, 16 <BR>Feeding: Tablet		&#40;-13/15 stress&#41; = 0, 3/1 <BR> <BR>Notice that in this month you have a full month to your primary monster. After this follow the regular schedule through out stage 2.  <BR> <BR><B>ALSO:</B> Wait for at least 2 months before sending it back to the errantry. <BR> <BR>Now Stage 3. <BR> <BR><B>STAGE 3: Adult</B> <BR> <BR>This is your monsters prime. This is the most important part of this method. After a year &#40; 12 month &#41; of the prime give your monster a golden peach. This will successfully extend your monsters prime by one more full year, giving you more time to max out stats. You can also give it a Silver Peach once your monster is over 6yrs old because that is when you can get one. I think the Silver Peach sets your monsters life back about 6 month, so you can use it to extend your prime, or use it before he dies. <BR> <BR>1.	Do not fail/cheat on anything. If so reload. <BR>2.	Do not get KO’d in battles. If so reload <BR>3.	Do no errantrys here. <BR>4.	If your monster gets to skinny or fat, feed it a powder or candy in place of none. <BR>5.	Do no errantrys here <BR>6.	Follow the method and you’ll do good. <BR> <BR> <BR><B>1st month: MB month</B> <BR> <BR>Week 1: Test monster <BR>Week 2: Test monster <BR>Week 3: MB, HD		&#40;&#43;15, &#43;24&#41; = 15, 24 <BR>Week 4: NO, HD		&#40;&#43;15, &#43;24, - 28 fatigue&#41; = 2, 48 <BR>Feeding: Tablet		&#40;-13/15 stress&#41; = 2, 35/33 <BR> <BR><B>2nd month: Rest month</B> <BR> <BR>Week 1: Test monster <BR>Week 2: Test monster <BR>Week 3: ML, HD		&#40;&#43;15, &#43;24, - 50% stress&#41; = 17, 27/28 <BR>Week 4: none &#42;/ML, rest		&#40;-33 fatigue, -7 stress&#41; = 0, 20/21 <BR>Feeding: Tablet		&#40;-13/15 stress&#41; = 0, 7/5 <BR> <BR>&#42; every other time you come across this, give him a ML to keep stress at minimal. <BR> <BR>That’s all for that. And if you are battling in this stage follow this method. <BR> <BR><B>Tourney Battle month:</B> <BR> <BR>Week 1: Test monster <BR>Week 2: Test monster <BR>Week 3: NO, HD		&#40;&#43;15, &#43;24, - 28 fatigue&#41; = 0, 24 <BR>Week 4: NO, Battle		&#40;-28 fatigue, ?&#42;&#41; = 0, 12          &#42;? - &#40;- 3 weeks life loss, ? Fatigue, ? Stress&#41; <BR>Feeding: Tablet		&#40;-13/15 stress&#41; = 0, 0 <BR> <BR>After this month, follow this: <BR> <BR><B>After Tourney Battle month:</B> <BR> <BR>Week 1: Test monster <BR>Week 2: Test monster <BR>Week 3: NO, HD		&#40;&#43;15, &#43;24, - 28 fatigue&#41; = 0, 24 <BR>Week 4: ML, rest		&#40;- 33 fatigue, - 7 stress, - 50% stress&#41; = 0, 12 <BR>Feeding: Tablet		&#40;- 13/15 stress&#41; = 0, 0 <BR> <BR><B>Major 4 battle month:</B> <BR> <BR>Week 1: Test monster <BR>Week 2: NO, Battle		&#40;-28 fatigue, ?&#41; = 0?, 0? <BR>Week 3: NO, HD		&#40;&#43;15,&#43; 24, - 28 fatigue&#41; = 0, 24 <BR>Week 4: ML, rest		&#40; - 33 fatigue, - 7 stress, - 50% stress&#41; = 0, 8 <BR>Feeding: Tablet		&#40;- 13/15 stress&#41; = 0, 0 <BR> <BR>Just go on to the MB month from here. <BR> <BR>Well that’s basically all there is to stage 3. If your monster is dropping in stats and you don’t want to train him any more go onto the freezing process.  <BR> <BR><B>FREEZING PROCESS:</B> <BR> <BR>Basically the freezing process is good for things like, gaining lots of money, raising your monster stats in battles, etc. All you do is before each battle take your monster out of the freezer, give him a NO, and go battle. Then go freeze him again and wait for the next one. Thats all. <BR> <BR><B>COMMENTS:</B> <BR> <BR>	That is basically my method there. You may notice that some of the items we did not even use. I put them up there simply for you, if you were going to use them. I also did not know the exact total of a battle but the life loss part. But I do know that it puts some fatigue, and stress, so I just used what seemed to make sense to give your monster after a battle. Using this method your monster should never be tired or stressed.This method should get your monster to a pretty high lifespan and get you really high stats. Also if you are worried about your loyalty dropping to fast, this method let’s you max out you loyalty in about 5 month because of the feeding. So your loyalty should raise pretty fast after you feed it a MB. I hope this method helps anyone out that is trying to beat the Major-4 and become a master.  <BR> <BR>ALSO: I just wanted to say that my 1st version of this method worked just great, but for you people wanting to see the math to just make sure it works, is cool with me. <BR> <BR><B>CREDITS:</B> <BR> <BR>	I credit a lot to &#42;R&#42; who wrote the thread “How to make your own training method. Most of the math I got from him. Also to Lisa Shock who posted “List of Items &amp; Foods and their Effects”   &#40;By: Dark Pheonix&#41;. Another one to Lisa who corrected me in my math. Without this stuff I could not have wrote this. This method was designed to go a bit quicker than DP’s method but still get a high lifespan monster with really high stats.

 here are the comments from the other thread...i am now deleted that one. <BR> <BR>By mepersoner on Tuesday, May 28, 2002 - 10:21 pm: <BR>Pretty good. Let&#39;s see the results.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR>By Lisa Shock on Tuesday, May 28, 2002 - 10:58 pm: <BR>The one problem I see is that he&#39;s not calculating stress correctly. The lifespan index is fatigue plus 2 times stress, not just fatigue and stress added. &#40;referencing the FAQ thread on fatigue and stress&#41; So, the math shown is incorrect.

I was so happy when I realized that I got my monster over the 5000 pt barrier. Especially when using my own method, and another thing, The D was a 1st Gen. I know that I seem a little bit to happy, and I know that you people with your methods have probably done the same, but I feel good now. But anyway, I kept him training in his prime for about 2 ½ years, using both the peaches. I started battling him at about 7yrs, 8 month. He got fed 64 bananas so that would make it, that he had an extra 64 WEEKS OF EXTRA LIFE. That helped out a lot. Also a correction in my method. I said in Stage 3 that there is no errantrys to be done here, but what I should of put is “You can do Special Errantrys here since you could not do them in the other stages, but only do them after your prime peak &#40; When your stats begin to drop a little &#41;.” Well thats about it. If you have any questions post or comments post’em. I wanna see them.

 It seems like an interesting method, but a bit bothersome to people who don&#39;t enjoy switching test monsters back and forth like in the DP method.  However...it might be useful for those market monsters...

 Ok, here I am. To Velo, this method is quite bothersome and long, but I tried to shorten it a bit more than DP&#39;s, while still getting almost the same results. If you want a good monster, than you will have to except that it will take time. This method is for people that are really patient and wanna take the time to get really high stats.  <BR> <BR>Also: For anyone trying this method, send your results. I want to see what this method can do to other monsters besides this Mocchi. I will start this again with a Joker. I want to see if this method is still good on Short life span monsters. I want to see how long I can make him live and how good.

Well This Strat Looks good to me, tho I have a question about it, does it really make a differance if you use to monsters at once or can you do it with just one monster?, also I am abit purplexed at how you got your stats so high through the stages, like stage one you got 700&#43; skill? man all I can get is 3 600&#39;s before my monster even dies, and without reading anything on this website, all I could get were 300, maybe 400 at most if I was lucky, so how did you gain so much so quick? <BR>one more question, you say you do LD and HD&#39;s but what LD&#39;s and HD&#39;s did you do? cause it does make differances depending on what monster you train, a moochi is well rounded but for a monster like ghost how would you get your life, power and defnce up with this method? <BR> <BR>e-mail me the reply if possable please. <BR> <BR>Peace Out <BR>

 You do LD and HD based on the age of the moster, and it&#39;s statgain pattern, like any other method. You can&#39;t necessarily completely max out every monster straight from CD with a method, but with many, like DP&#39;s you can come very close. I maxxed out a Mocchi &#40;all stats over 950&#41; in 5y 3m, by using DP&#39;s method &#40;no bananas&#41; with troron in childhood. It&#39;s all a matter of making sure you don&#39;t lose any more lifespan than absolutely neccessary, through doing the math on stress/fatigue each week.

 To anonymous, It is very low of a chance that you maxxed it out if it was first gen. Also it took me a while to test this method myself.  <BR> <BR>To DewwClaww, you can only use one monster in this method because, the one being trained on the 3rd and 4th week get the tablet feeding, which eliminates the stress. The one on 1st and 2nd week does not get that, so he would not be able to get MB&#39;s if you wanted to train him, because of stress. I got such high skill because a Mocchi gets about 4-7&#39;s on those drills. He went though stage one for 2 yr 4 month, which is an incredible 1st stage. I said in the method to do your best stat using HD&#39;s during 2nd stage. Then in 3rd stage you do your worst stats using HD&#39;s. And in first stage only do LD&#39;s in skill.  <BR> <BR>Well I&#39;m glad you guys liked it, and I hope you try it.

 So would this work, lets say I train a zuum gen 1 from the market. feed him tablets on the second and forth week of the month, feed him mint leaves and on the frist week nuts oil, third week rest feeding him either nothing or Magic bananna. <BR>would this work with your method?

 Well, the key thing about a method is, for people to follow it. Now, no - offense but if you would like to make your own method, go right ahead, but leave this method how it is. Just try it, then start thinking of maybe better ways of making a method.

 Well here is an update on The D. It turned out he lived for about another year or so, with &#40;I think&#41; about 4 more month of life left.

 If you guys are wondering why his stats did not raise to much, was because he only went to about 3 or 4 battles, the rest of the time he went on expedetions and training. He did about 6 or 7 expeditions and then some training and a couple battles.
