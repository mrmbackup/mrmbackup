 Hi! I didn&#39;t know how to add this message on the other topic with the same name so i had to come up with a new one.  <BR>I think i have seen some paterns on the status gains after the tournaments, i was playing with an undine, and i battle a lot, but when the prime came i stopped battling and just trained the spd and int to above 500 and the ski to 600.  <BR>Prime was over in about 7 months! Then i still trained a little on these to about 750, at this time i started battling a lot, and after 850 on the 3 stats i stopped training them and just trained defense and entered tournaments. <BR>I started to feel lucky, because after the battle it would always give me defense &#40;well, almost always&#41;and almost always give lif. Actually it did give me def, lif and any other status 6 times in a row, so i thought it couldn&#39;t be a coincidence, to me it seems as the status were getting to the same pattern as it was when i got it from combination. <BR>i dont remember exactly &#40;only pow and int&#41;but it was like this: <BR>lif 10x <BR>pow 69 <BR>int 207 <BR>ski 16x <BR>spd 15x <BR>def 11x <BR>x=number i dont remember <BR> <BR>now the final status: <BR>Name: Ougi    Race: Mermaid &#40;undine/???&#41; <BR>lif 390 <BR>pow 168 <BR>int 981 <BR>ski 941 <BR>spd 971 <BR>def 565 <BR>4y 2mo &#40;more 2-3 months and it dies&#41; <BR>205W 0L 180Ko <BR>Style:even <BR>Form:normal &#40;started plump&#41; <BR>Likes:Me   &#40;started potato&#41; <BR>Dislikes:milk <BR>Nature:best &#40;started good&#41; <BR>--just to brag-- got in the hall of fame, and beat akirel on the first try &#40;lucky, hit him about 3 times, received a hit that almost killed her and activated POWER, then finishing him with an aqua waves, then cold fog :&#41; &#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;i got in the battles at that time more than 200 lif and about 150-200def, and about 100 for the spd ski int pow&#41; <BR> <BR>So i thought that as the spd, ski and int were almost maxed, the other status tried to keep up with them, in proportion. The only other explanation to getting both lif and def together that many times was that the emulator was bugging, as it does when i try to get something from shrine. <BR>But my theory is that the monster grows in proportion to its initial abilities &#40;just like in a pokemon game&#41;, as now i am training a niton/jell that started with  <BR>170 lif  <BR>130-140pow <BR>about 170 int  <BR>150-160ski <BR>260 spd <BR>200 def <BR>And it is getting a lot of def, lif and spd, it almost always gets def, more than any other... <BR>Also i get the monsters by combining gamesharked monters, in fact you&#39;re wondering how i got the mermaid, i combined an old monster i had when i still had my ps&#40;after turning it from a naga to an undine&#41; with a market monster turned main and sub to the digit &#34;26&#34; monster. &#40;main ??? sub???&#41; <BR> <BR>I just thought i should post it here and it would be a nice addition to the site if confirmed, and if someone also get to the same conclusion as me, please post it here too. <BR>Oh, and i noticed people here often think others are liying or demand proof, i have NO PROOF, i can easily send my save to you but it wouldn&#39;t prove nothing, so unless a lot of peole confirm that they have noticed the same thing as i did this may need some testing.

 Mepersoner would probably be the expert on this, since his method relies on post-battle gains.  <BR> <BR>That said, it&#39;s really difficult to differentiate between random outcomes and a programmed tendency without running a thousand test battles. &#40;or hacking the software&#41; Even with really simple events, like coin flips or dice tosses, you can get streaks where things look predetermined when they aren&#39;t -like getting double sixes 10 times in a row. <BR> <BR>I heard of an amusing test a college professor uses to check people&#39;s ability to spot randomness. He has two small groups each take a coin and go into another room away from the main class. One group tosses the coin a hundred times and writes down each result as it happens: h,t,t,t,h,h,t,h,h,h, etc. The other group just writes down h and t in a random sequence that they feel approximates what would happen in a coin toss. The two charts are then shown to the main class without letting anyone know which sequence is the real flips and which was faked. Invariably, the class chooses the fake set of data as real, because it tends to be more even-handed. The real data will have long streaks of one side of the coin coming up maybe 35&#43; times in a row, and, the over distribution won&#39;t be close to 50-50 for each result -more like 70-30 h-t. &#40;yes, using a &#39;fair coin&#39; a specially balanced coin designed for this purpose&#41; <BR> <BR>In closing, with six different attributes and two slots to fill &#40;and the fact that a stat won&#39;t appear in both slots&#41; that&#39;s a lot of selections for just plain probability to present to the player.

 I didnt know there was a method based on this, it would be cool... i just looked at both Mepersoner methods and no one said nothing about it. <BR>But doesnt anyone have a money maker monster that just battle and doesnt really train? It should be easy to observe if theres any truth to what i just said on one of those. <BR>About probability, i read about the method of chosing three drills, then cancelling and going to battle, then two of them should appear... if you do the math its about 50% chance that it will happen, so it makes the hocus pocus look true. <BR>And on my results, i know it can be a coincidence but it just didnt look like a simple coincidence, but i understand what you said about the coin test. &#40;Even if i was only getting those stats that were almost maxed one of them each battle, there were times when i got 2 or all 3 of them, but it wasnt even 25% of the time, i&#39;m pretty sure.&#41;

 Hmmm, sorry, meep was using an all battle method, I guess he never submitted it for us. I talked to him about it in chat years ago. I&#39;ll try to nudge him to publish it.... <BR> <BR>The thing about probability is that each time you do something &#40;battle&#41; the chance of the outcome is the same as every other instance. So, just because your coin toss was heads for the last twenty flips, the next flip still has a 50% chance either way -there&#39;s no cosmic balance that says once you do a hundred flips you&#39;ll see 50 be heads and 50 be tails. <BR> <BR>You may have discovered something, I am just pointing out how much something can seem real when it&#39;s just the game&#39;s random number generator.
