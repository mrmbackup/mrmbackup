Akirel&#40;Gali/Zuum&#41; is the most powerful computer monster in the game. Holly will randomly choose it to battle you in the Class S IMA-FIMBA meet. &#40;Akirel is green in color&#41;  <BR> <BR>Stats: LIF-855, POW-839, INT-827, SKI-731, SPD-940, DEF-822, TOT-5014.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;RNA@Ribosome.nuc&#41;, December 02, 1999  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>ahh yes that green gali.. i thought it was a gali/suezo but im not sure btw since this is a spoiler i dont think that guy was half as bad as the white suezo ya run into at the legends cup  <BR> <BR>-- Dave &#40;woodehart@aol.com&#41;, December 02, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Nah, the green Gali was a push over. Two lightning bolts and a big bang and he went down. He never landed a blow on Aphrael &#40;3rd generation Angel, 997 spd, third of that name&#41;. Holly&#39;s Suezo wasn&#39;t much of a problem either, But Most, the white Mocchi, was a certified pain in the butt. Like the other computer controlled Mocchi in the game, the little twit never seems to miss, no matter what his percentages are. And he gets GRIT. I only won because Aphrael got power, and toasted him with a lightning bolt. One more hit and it would have been over.  <BR> <BR>-Berge  <BR> <BR>-- Berge &#40;rellis@bigidea.com&#41;, December 02, 1999.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Must have gotten pretty lucky with that Big Bang, then. As I recall, it only does A damage with an E hit%. With Akirel having that much Speed, your chances of landing that move and killing him must have been pretty slim. In addition, one of my &#39;S&#39; force moves only took about 500 on him, so you might have gotten a critical hit on him. Either that or you faced the other Gali in the IMa-FIMBA meet.  <BR> <BR>At any rate, I thought that Akirel was tougher than Most, and I fought them both numerous times. For Akirel, I was forced to use one of my top-of-the-line monsters to win, while Most had his ass handed to him on a silver platter by several of my monsters.  <BR> <BR>-- Sean X. Chang &#40;chang.319@osu.edu&#41;, December 02, 1999.
