 Well, I joked aruond about doing it. And since I just finished raising a tiger critter, I decided that I may as well set up my rating and comments on it. Why? Just &#39;cause I feel like it! Feel free to add your own in as well. Might be interesting to see people&#39;s reactions to hte various creatures. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, MR2 doesn&#39;t seem to have as many Tigers as MR1 has. Either that, or they&#39;re just harder to get. Really too bad, since they&#39;re such fun creatures to play with. They have short lifespans &#40;right down there with nagas and jokers&#41;, but those years aer worth it! <BR> <BR>Tigers aer skill monsters, first and foremost. An infusion of tiger blood into your breeding pool should help most monsters with that &#39;skill&#39; deficit, as long as you don&#39;t mind the fact that they&#39;re also very, very fragile. Without defense and low life, the only thing they have going for them is speed &#40;and even that isn&#39;t as good as some of the things out there, from what I found&#41;. their high intelligence helps some, though they start with power attacks &#40;sound familiar, pixie-trainers?&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Tigers attacks are mostly sharpness-based in one way or another. Their sharp techs, especially, are well worth the getting &#40;ice bomb and blizzard&#41;, especially since they are ingtelligence-based. Another bonus tigers have is that they&#39;re extremely &#39;good&#39; monsters. While the Suezo blood in mine gave me some trouble at first, it quickly settled down and worked like a charm. They do have a habit of bringing yuo lost of useless stuff, though: bones, shoes, galoe nuts, and flowers. <BR> <BR>Since I&#39;m not good at numbers, I can&#39;t give them a numeretical rating. However, I&#39;d like to say that the short lifespan of tigers is _really_ unfortunate. I would have loved to raise the guy for a few more years. Ah well. Guess you&#39;ve gotta have something to ruond them out.

Tigers actually have a little more than Joker...but nice review. They make good subs for durahan and golem too.

 I am a great tiger fan and i&#39;ve found the best way to over come it&#39;s lifespan is to give it golem blood and use plant disc chips.
