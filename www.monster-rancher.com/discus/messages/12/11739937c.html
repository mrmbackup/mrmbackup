 yes, I have. If you find a peach and the Sheath in one expo, you get paid. My dad did it once. Never found the peach again, though.

 of course you get &#34;paid&#34; in that you can sell the materials at the end of the expedition, including the sheath and the peach.  but, to my knowledge, there is no other &#34;payment&#34; possible. <BR> <BR>as for the peaches, i have gotten 3 at one trip.  i have heard credible reports of 4 being possible.  2 is quite common, actually.

 No, Torey, if youd&#39;ve read my post, you would know this. If you find the sheath and GP in one trip, Kavaro says,&#34;Wow! quite a haul!&#34; and gives you a sack of cash when tallying your found items.It was a very meager account, but I imagine more than one peach would net you a larger bank. I&#39;m not sure about getting the&#39;Great!&#39; screen without &#39;maybe&#39; though.

did you do this too?  or did only your dad?  did you see him do this with your own eyes, or is this a second hand account of what he remembers as happening? <BR> <BR>again, this is new knowledge about mr2, so please don&#39;t imagine anything.  would you be so kind as to replicate your results, and walk us through exactly what happens?  how much money?  can you get the sheath every time, or is this a one time deal? <BR> <BR>thanks in advance.

 OK, this is kind of a bad thing because I&#39;m going off of memory, but I&#39;m sure you are to Da_Mullet, and it wasn&#39;t even you that was playing. Irregardless, I got a Gold Peach, Old Sheath, and some other little goodies, and it said Great!&#40;I also recall him saying &#34;Wow! Quite a haul!&#34; Or at least something along those lines&#41;However...I didn&#39;t get any money. I&#39;ve never gotten money on my expeditions, and Kavaro is a cheap SOB who wants to keep all my Gold Peaches.

 Yes, I did see it with my own eyes. He entered the adventure with Gonzales, gen 1 Mock/Mock, 200&#43;lif, 300&#43;pow, 300&#43;int., 200&#43;ski, 150&#43;spd, 50&#43;def. C-grade at the time, full of energy. entered the shriney thing, found Sheath almost immediately, entered Tusk Tower to use up leftover energy. Found peach, went through cinima about Kavaro wanting to keep it. At the end of the expo, they counted the items found: Disk chips&#40;Tiger&#41;, disk chips&#40;Gali&#41;, Half eaten, Old Sheath, Golden Peach, Bag of money. &#34;Great haul. Maybe I&#39;ll see you next time.&#34; Here&#39;s your payment. <BR> <BR>Solid truth, on my honor as a MRM member.

 hm... i came up with the idea that, besides we have to find both peaches and sheath, we also have to find as many items as possible, after i found the sheath and peaches, i continue with life about 400 and went to 3 or 4 dungeons &#40;or whtever u call it&#41; and i found about 20 items which i can&#39;t hold all of that. <BR> <BR>it&#39;s strange that i got paid 500G while Harrabcat only 250G.are there any other get 250G?

 I&#39;ve also got that same &#34;Great! Maybe...&#34; message during the Pare Pare Expedition. Just like everyone who is reporting seeing it, I got both the Gold Peach and the Old Sheath, along other items. I can&#39;t remember how much Kavaro paid me after that, but it was very little. <BR>I&#39;m about to start a new save file on MR2, so maybe I can double-check it when I get to that point.

 so, the requirement for &#34;great! maybe&#34; is gold peach and old sheath. if that&#39;s great!maybe, there must be more succesfull wordds than that &#40;could be &#34;wonderful!&#34; &#34;really great!&#34; &#34;great!&#34; or something like that&#41; i&#39;ll try to find it. also i wonder if other expeditions got this message too.

 Maybe. When Kavaro/Talico/Rovest introduce themselves to you, they all promise to pay money if you help them on their expeditions... <BR>I guess the requirement is to get 2 rare items on one trip.

Now that I remember, I&#39;ve got that same &#34;Great! Maybe&#34; message when going to Rovest&#39;s expedition. I found both the Strong Glue and the Big Footprint that time... <BR>Anyway, I just finished checking this on Pare Pare, yesterday. <BR>Went to the expedition with a 1st gen Suezo &#40;Suezo/Suezo&#41;, slated from a...

Also, had to discard another Larox because I didn&#39;t have enough space in inventory. <BR>After returning to the Base Camp, you get the following speech... <BR> <BR>Kavaro: Well, well, MONSTER still did a great job! <BR>Kavaro: The adventure was a great success because of it. <BR>Colt: A great job indeed! <BR>Kavaro: Let me give you a reward for your hard work.

I&#39;m dead! <BR>Colt: We discovered a rare item. <BR>Colt: ...We did a good job. <BR> <BR>I have a save file right on the 4th week of September, in case you want me to take photos or something like that &#40;I don&#39;t have a Dex Drive...&#41;. <BR>I think the requirement for &#34;Great! Maybe&#34; is to get two rare items &#40;for the first time&#41; on one trip. This means, seeing the animation for them. So it&#39;s a one time deal. <BR>I&#39;ll try to check for the other two expeditions, but that might take a while, since I don&#39;t have a Quack Doll yet, and I got the Fire Feather on the first expedition with Talico...

 great job! now i really left behind, thanks a lot. I still wonder if there&#39;s anything more than great maybe, i think it is impossible to get more than 2 rare items in an expedition isn&#39;t it? since gold peaches doesn&#39;t count as rare items... or more than one gold peaches onnly counted as one...

Just made another save file, on the 4th week of May, to check if you can get the same message on other expeditions. <BR>Well, guess what? It is possible. With the same Suezo &#40;had a little higher stats, of course... But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s important now, is it?&#41; I managed to pick up the Mask, Pure Platina, Half-eaten &#40;x2&#41;, Pure Gold and Gods&#39; Slate on one trip to Kawrea. <BR>At the end of the expedition, got the exact same dialog as with Kavaro when finding the Gold Peach and the Old Sheath, except Dr. Talico gave me 1500G instead of just 500. <BR>I think the way I said it before was somewhat confusing. The requirement for &#34;Great! Maybe&#34; <I>should</I> be getting 2 <B>different</B> rare items on one try. I need to test now if it has to be the first time you get them too. Also, since Kawrea has more than 2 rare items, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more. <BR>I&#39;m starting another new game to test this. Might take another week until I post the results.

 yup, this also proves what Infernus said in the beginning:Kavaro is a cheap SOB who wants to keep all my Gold Peaches.&#34; <BR> <BR>whereas Talico is much more accomodating. I imagine both the footprint and the glue on one Rovest expo nets you either 1000 or 2000.

 Sorry for not updating in a long while. I&#39;ve been having some problems lately and haven&#39;t been able to test about getting 3 different rare items on Kawrea. <BR>However, since New_Nice_guy posted about it, I wonder if you still want me to test it out, since this isn&#39;t exactly the most impressive information about the game.

After all, this adventure was... <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Great!</FONT> <BR> <BR>What Colt said when returning to the Ranch changed too... <BR> <BR>Colt: Phew! I&#39;m dead! <BR>Colt: Well, the adventure ended in success. <BR>Colt: If this is typical I want to go again. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m getting confused about this... People have reported getting 2 Gold Peaches on one trip to Pare Pare, yet they didn&#39;t receive any reward. Has anyone tried to get 2 Gold Peaches <B>and</B> the Old Sheath? <BR>From what I&#39;ve tested, I guess &#34;Great!&#34; is the most you can get. Got the same message when finding the Mask and 2 Gods&#39; Slates, but I didn&#39;t write it down that time because I didn&#39;t expect that. In fact... I almost had to hit my head against a wall after this =/... <BR>I wonder what the requirement for &#34;Great!&#34; is then...
