 I have a question about finding gold peaches. I just  <BR>went on the ParePare expedition and my Mustard Arrow  <BR>&#40;800&#43; INT&#41; found me two gold peaches in one trip.  <BR>Surprised me. I have searched this site and haven&#39;t  <BR>found any mention of being able to obtain 2 in one  <BR>trip. Is this a new finding or have I just been  <BR>unlucky up until now?

 I think a higher intelligence increases the chance of finding items and the quality of items that you find, and  <BR>therefore as you reach higher levels, like 800&#43;, your chance of getting a good item &#40;Paradoxine, peaches etc.&#41; is  <BR>good enough that probability is in your favour for getting more than one of an item. I remember taking a 600 int.  <BR>monster to get paradoxine and not finding one after around 25 attempts, then eventually once its intelligence was  <BR>maxxed out it found 2 first go. I&#39;d say if you&#39;ve been doing expeditions with 800&#43; monsters and not getting  <BR>doubles of rare items you&#39;re probably just unlucky.

 I thought we had talked about it. People have gotten as many as 4 on one trip.

 I&#39;ve taken many maxxed INT monsters to get peaches  <BR>in the past and they only ever found one in a trip,  <BR>sometimes none. I guess I should&#39;ve been retrying to  <BR>see if I could get more this whole time..

 There&#39;s a chance that maxxing other stats as well will help. <BR> <BR>Other than that, we think that some of the hidden characteristics of some monsters may affect this.

 Hmm well I have heard about PeachTreeBugs being good at finding peaches, so maybe Arrowhead breeds or more specifically Suezo subbreeds have an affinity for it as well. One thing I do know for sure; Plants DON&#39;T seem to have an knack for finding peaches. I&#39;ve raised and maxxed many plants INT and LIF with little results except for the usual one peach per go. The one thing that my Mustard Arrow did have that my Plants didn&#39;t was added POW, mainly for helping tank against POW attacks in battle since he was a 1st gen and I wanted to concentrate on his INT techs. I can&#39;t see how POW would have anything to do with finding better items, but who knows.

 All I recall is that all of my totally maxxed monsters were good peach hunters.

 Well perhaps EVERY stat plays its own special role  <BR>in finding items, instead of just mainly INT. I just  <BR>found a PeachTreeBug on a disk and I have never  <BR>raised one before so after I raise a pure first gen  <BR>Durahan to combine with my Mustard Arrow, I&#39;m gonna  <BR>see what this little guy can dig up!

 I&#39;ve taken my most recent Suezo/Zuum on several Parepare trips.  He has maxed INT and SKI.  He only ever found one peach per trip, but he found them pretty reliably.  The nice thing about having high INT is that the monster almost never wastes time searching areas that don&#39;t have items, or re-searching areas he&#39;s already been to,  I just wish there were other useful items in Parepare - once I find the peach, I&#39;ve still got a good 550 or so life points left.  I end up just finding a bunch of disc chips in the other buildings and selling them for profit.

 Actually that pure first gen Durahan that I just raised as combining fodder managed to maxx his INT &#40;oh and DEF obviously&#41; and he found me 3 peaches in one trip! New milestone for me.
