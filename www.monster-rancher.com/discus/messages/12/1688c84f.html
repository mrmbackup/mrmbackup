 Having paged through Nevistar&#39;s numbers in the Stress and Fatigue thread in FAQs &#40;which I urge everyone to do -- they&#39;re great information&#41;, I have an urge to test out something that the numbers seem to suggest: <BR> <BR>Unless rest has some property about it apart from its relationship with stress and fatigue, _it is not needed_ if you&#39;re sticking to light drills and have a large checkbook ready for items. <BR>   <BR>Obviously, any monster worth its salt WILL be going on hard drills, errantries, battles, etc. on occasion, so this is not particularly useful in and of itself... but in the theoretical, I find it very interesting.   <BR> <BR>Test subject A:  A Hare &#40;preferably a Hare/Pixie, since it&#39;d be pink.&#41;  ;&#41;  It&#39;s of Good nature &#40;to minimize cheating&#41; and likes Tablets.  I bring it into the world on the first week of January, and put it right to work.  Feeding it one item per week and light-drilling it continuously, how long can the rabbit stay in equilibrium? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working with the following numbers from Nevistar&#39;s and DP&#39;s input: <BR> <BR>Nuts Oil: -28 Fatigue, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear <BR>Mint Leaf: -1/2 Stress, -2 Spoil, -5 Form <BR>Star Prune: &#43;20 Fame, &#43;5 Spoil, &#43;1 Form <BR>Mango: -10 Fatigue, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear, &#43;1 Form <BR>Tablet &#40;liked&#41;: -15 Stress, &#43;3 Form/Spoil, &#43;2 Fear <BR> <BR>Lifespan Index: &#40;2&#42;Str&#41;&#43;Ftg, lifespan hits at 70 or greater. <BR>Fatigue:  &#34;seems tired&#34; at 40 or greater. <BR> <BR>Colt&#39;s Cake &#40;birthday&#41;: &#43;15 Form.  <BR> <BR>Thus, the target of the exercise is to come up with a twelve-month scheme that leaves the monster as close to the following as possible: <BR> <BR>Spoil = Fear.  Form = -15.  Fatigue never goes over 40.  LI never goes over 70, requiring some stress management.  Light drill every week, Tablet every month, NO REST.   <BR> <BR>On paper... and only on paper, so far... it&#39;s not that difficult to do.  Mangoes are used more weeks than not, with Nuts Oils as needed to erase fatigue, one Mint Leaf per month to minimize stress to where the Tablet will erase the rest of it each month.  Star Prunes at irregular intervals to keep Spoil in balance.  The Tablet &#40;&#43;3 Form, &#43;3 Spoil&#41; helps keep the Mint Leaves &#40;-5 Form, -2 Spoil&#41; in balance.  Nuts Oils replace Mangoes more often as the end of the year progresses, so as to keep the Form down, and an extra Mint Leaf here or there should produce the -15 at end-of-year when needed. <BR> <BR>My random variables are the effects of cheating and drill failures.  I do not have the numbers for how those events &#40;and scolding/not scolding&#41; affect stress and fatigue, but I assume that for light drills they&#39;d be minimal enough that some judgement in item use would keep everything pretty steady.  Greats would only enhance results, as they&#39;d reduce fatigue slightly.   <BR> <BR>On paper, I&#39;ve got it worked out almost perfectly over a year&#39;s time.  In the game?  I&#39;ll experiment when I have time, but preliminary results &#40;playing around with a late-prime Jill&#41; were promising... <BR> <BR>Can the rabbit keep going, and going, and going until the shooting star comes along?  We&#39;ll see. <BR>&#40;Or am I on crack?&#41;

 Sounds like an interesting premise.  How do you track the numbers? Are you just estimating based on what&#39;s known, or will you use a gameshark when you do the experiment?

 I use a Gameshark Pro and Nevistar uses an Xplorer FX  to view the contents of the memory locations directly.

 Locke, I&#39;m tracking numbers by hand &#40;or by Excel when I take the time to enter them in, for convenience&#41;... but basing them on DP&#39;s and Nevistar&#39;s research.  Without their hard numbers to work from, I&#39;d be guessing at quite a bit. <BR> <BR>The nice thing about this particular experiment is that, as far as I see, there is very little randomness involved.  Drills cause a predictable amount of stress and fatigue &#40;though I&#39;d still love to know for sure what cheating, failures and/or scolding do to the mix&#41;, there&#39;s no random factor from rest &#40;since we&#39;re skipping rest entirely&#41;, and the items have predictable results, so in theory it&#39;s just an exercise in optimizing the monster&#39;s work cycle. <BR> <BR>Again, this is no way anyone would ever want to raise a REAL contender, but it will be fun to try. It could have applications for late-prime contenders that want to built stats steadily without risking failure from three-star hard drills -- a steady diet of points from light drills with no lifespan hits, perhaps resting before or after high-level battles.   <BR> <BR>Now, here&#39;s another point to ponder.  Under this system, the test subject does nothing but light drills.  No battles, no errantries, no expeditions, no nuthin&#39;, just sucking up items and tablets and doing the drills as assigned, with no lifespan hits from fatigue or stress.  Normal body type, high loyalty and good nature are maintained. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s to stop him from living the full potential lifespan?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going away this weekend and will be busy this week, so I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;ll have the time to make the experiment.  I&#39;ll follow up on this when I have time...

 First experiment: <BR> <BR>I slated over a pure Hare from MR1 last night, who turned out to be everything I was looking for -- good nature, liked tablets, disliked potatoes, nothing else unusual about him.  Saved him at his birth week &#40;4th week January&#41; while I was waiting for my fiancee to get home from work, for something to do.   <BR> <BR>Initial responses... were GOOD.  Going by intuition rather than by on-paper system, he went from 4th week January to mid-June &#40;when my fiancee got home, and I turned the game off&#41; without once getting tired or resting.  This was just playing around and keeping totals in my head; had I gone with a more structured test, I&#39;d be even more confident about the results.   <BR> <BR>However... the variable that I was worried about did creep up on me.  The hare did fail twice and get one Great in the first four months, and since I was unsure to what extent scolding and/or lack-of-praise would affect its stress, I took the easy way out and spoiled it.  End result: it never got tired, but it did go to &#34;Fond&#34; in a hurry.   <BR> <BR>Obviously, scolding it when necessary would have prevented this, and the problem will largely evaporate as time goes by &#40;as Spoil and Fear points both pile up, so that one praise-or-scold incident will affect the difference between them less&#41;.  Or a Smoked Snake in the early going, but &#40;again&#41; since I was just playing around, I wasn&#39;t sure in which week I could throw that in without stressing/fatiguing the critter.   <BR> <BR>More as time allows, and if anyone has the numbers on how praise and scolding &#40;or lack of either&#41; affect stress and loyalty, I&#39;d be quite interested.  &#40;Not scolding must make Spoil go up like a rocket!&#41;

 Okay, I ran my Hare through a bit of a formal test tonight, and if these results are at all typical, it can safely be said that the Energizer Bunny experiment is a rather smashing success. <BR> <BR>My Hare just celebrated his second birthday, has been &#34;well&#34; every week of his life, has light-drilled &#40;skipping around from drill to drill a bit&#41; every week of his life, has never been &#34;stressed out&#34;, been spoiled, or had any other ill effects...  AND HAS NEVER RESTED.  Not even once. <BR> <BR>The training method: <BR> <BR>One Tablet every month. <BR>Light Drill every week. <BR>Most months:  Mango/Mango/Mint Leaf/Nuts Oil. <BR>Another item can be substituted in place of the first Mango on occasion -- say, a Candy for fattening or a Smoked Snake for discipline -- but don&#39;t make a habit of it, as doing it more than one or two months in a row might put him over the edge to stress or &#34;tired.&#34; <BR> <BR>On its first failure, I scolded it.  I&#39;ve been going about 50/50 on failures since &#40;he&#39;s only had about 3-5 total in two years&#41;.  The one time he tried to cheat, he was scolded.  He&#39;s been praised  every time when finding Galoe Nuts or getting a Great. <BR> <BR>Some further notes: <BR> <BR>&#42;  Keeping him at a &#34;Normal&#34; body type has been more of a chore than anticipated.  By my calculations, the form bonus from Tablets &#40;&#43;3&#41; and two Mangoes &#40;&#43;1 each&#41; should be keeping pace with the one Mint Leaf &#40;-5&#41; per month... but it isn&#39;t, as the monster is consistently slipping towards Slim.  I&#39;ve been working an occasional Candy into the mix in Week 1 to counteract this, with success. <BR> <BR>&#42;  Not to question the man with the numbers, but Colt&#39;s birthday cake CAN&#39;T be that fattening!  I&#39;ve had this Hare wavering between Slim and Normal for the last few months of its second year -- one month I won&#39;t give it a Candy and it&#39;ll be Slim, the next it&#39;ll get a Candy and be Normal.  Its birthday arrived, it ate the &#43;15 Cake and stayed Slim!  Something&#39;s not adding up there. <BR> <BR>&#42;  I suspect that drills, the passage of months, the growth process, SOMETHING is thus lowering Form besides the Mint Leaves.  It only makes sense that if the monster&#39;s continuously working and never resting, it _should_ be keeping thin, no?  It&#39;s not lowering it by much -- say, -1 or -2 a month at most -- but it is staying at &#34;Thin&#34; when I didn&#39;t expect it to be.  Wouldn&#39;t it be a kick if certain drills &#40;say, &#34;Run,&#34; &#34;Endure,&#34; or such physical drills&#41; had a -1 Form attached to them, while sedentary drills like Study did not &#40;or added &#43;1 Form, since the monster&#39;s sitting on its butt that week&#41;? <BR> <BR>&#42;  With the praise and lack of failures to scold, the hare&#39;s Loyalty stabilized at around 85 for many months with a &#34;Soft&#34; style.  I finally broke down and gave it a Smoked Snake &#40;dreading that extra -10 Form, but oh well&#41; to turn it around, and it went right up to ~95-100 Loyalty in a month or two.  This was not unexpected. <BR> <BR>&#42;  The monster&#39;s Loyalty does seem to skip around a little bit, growing a bit faster than expected over its first year or so, sometimes going up or down when the item it&#39;s being fed doesn&#39;t completely explain it.  &#40;No more than a point or two at a time, but...&#41;  Is there any chance of a hidden Spoil/Fear boost going on here, i.e. if the  monster&#39;s staying at &#34;Well&#34; or better and is happy with its surroundings, its Loyalty grows automatically up to a point &#40;with its training style affecting how high it can go without item aids&#41;? <BR> <BR>This Hare&#39;s Loyalty started around 7 or so &#40;it was Slated, that might have something to do with that&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42;  The monster hit Stage 2 after precisely 80 weeks of drilling.  This did excite me, as it&#39;s a nice round number &#40;exactly one-fifth of its predicted 400 week lifespan&#41;.  I&#39;ll be keeping a careful eye out to see when it Primes, to see if it&#39;s at a similar week multiple &#40;say, 160 or 200&#41;. <BR>If this works out as I hope it will, it&#39;ll reinforce that a non-stressful, active, non-fatigued lifestyle like this will produce a MAXIMUM lifespan.  It makes logical sense, but this is a videogame -- you can&#39;t always expect that to happen.  ;&#41;  RNA has noted that different monsters tend to have different lengths for their stages, and I can note that I had a Jill/Kato that went LD-LD-LD-Rest throughout childhood that grew at exactly three years of age.  &#40;Crossbreeds are funny though.&#41;  Anyone had a pure Hare hit Stage 2 later than 1 year, 8 months without peaches? <BR> <BR>&#42;  The monster has asked for items exactly twice, both in the fourth week of the month when its stress would be at its peak for that month &#40;at 10 -- not in a danger zone yet, but right before the fourth drill of the month would put it at 15 Stress / 10 Fatigue / 40 LI, its highest point in the month&#41;.  I refused to give it the item each time, with no visible effect on stress.   <BR> <BR>&#40;It&#39;s been noted that monsters usually ask for items when they feel a little stressed.  I can&#39;t verify that LI&#39;s not hitting the 70 mark after the light drill without a Game Shark or something similar, as this is happening just as a Tablet should be wiping out all of its remaining stress. So even if it was at 70 at the month&#39;s beginning, let&#39;s say, the Tablet would wipe out the stress before I&#39;d get a &#34;Monster is stressed out&#34; message.  However, if my numbers are correct, it should _not_ be hitting LI 70 &#40;or within 20 points of it&#41; at any point... it&#39;ll be interesting to see just how close to 400 weeks this creature lives.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;  More to come as the monster approaches Prime.  In the meantime, I&#39;m gonna go watch South Park now.  ;&#41;

 Second update: <BR> <BR>The test Hare just Primed, at 4 years, 2 months of age.  Not too shabby for a Hare! <BR> <BR>Especially when you consider that he primed after exactly 200 weeks of drilling.  His predicted base lifespan is 400 weeks.  I sense a pattern here.  :&#41; <BR> <BR>Stats aren&#39;t too bad -- ~650 POW, ~600 SPD, ~500 SKI, ~250 LIF, ~100 DEF and INT, not earthshaking, but not terrible for a nothing-special monster that started with nothing over 150 and has never seen a Hard Drill.  Of course, it has only 1-2-Punch and Gas, so it&#39;s not exactly going to challenge Most when it&#39;s done... <BR> <BR>Still no stress or fatigue problems, he&#39;s at a perfect 100 Loyalty &#40;bouncing down to 98 and back up as the weeks roll by&#41;, and still NO REST. <BR> <BR>The trick is going to be figuring out when he&#39;s _leaving_ pure Prime -- I&#39;ll keep a close eye out at 300 and 320 weeks &#40;childhood lasted 80 weeks for this breed, perhaps old age will too&#41; for signs of a decline.  There&#39;s no obvious size change to telegraph senility, so I&#39;ll have to wing it. <BR> <BR>He&#39;s still tending to slip down to Slim at intervals; mixing in Candy fixes this, but it leaves me in doubt as to whether I can do this plan with a Tablet-neutral monster.  &#40;On the other hand, Spoil seems to have increased fast enough with this one that I might not need the Prunes I&#39;d anticipated with a neutral critter.&#41; <BR> <BR>Next stop: 6 years 8 months, my prediction for when he&#39;ll start slowing down.  But definitely not stopping...

 And the final verdict is... IT WORKED. <BR> <BR>The test Hare successfully lasted through 400 consecutive weeks of light drills: NO REST, no &#34;tired&#34;, no &#34;stressed&#34;, and &#40;from the fact that it lasted all 400 weeks&#41; no LI over 70 at any time.  I have him saved in Week 400 right now; in the next week, no matter what I do next, he goes to a VERY-well-deserved rest at age 8 years, 4 months.  <BR> <BR>No Peaches were used.  I had a Fire Stone in the inventory, which would act as a Gemini Pot and Sculpture during the winter months, but since Fatigue never went over 30 and Stress never went over 15 &#40;and it never rested&#41;, it had no effect.  A Hero Badge was the only other thing in the inventory apart from Peaches, Disc Chips, the Old Sheath, etc. <BR> <BR>The Tablet/Mango/Mango/Mint Leaf/Nuts Oil system was used throughout, with an occasional Candy in place of the first Mango when he needed the calories.  A Smoked Snake was used once, well into the training process, when he was at Soft Style, 85 Loyalty and holding.  The fact that he liked tablets knocked off an extra 2 Stress per month, and I&#39;m not sure I could have done it without liking them and kept the monster at Normal form, but maybe I&#39;ll try it sometime. <BR> <BR>Final stats: <BR>LIF 710 POW 999 INT 100 SKI 752 SPD 999 DEF 125 <BR>Total: 3685.  Hell, I&#39;ve had NORMALLY-treated  monsters end with less than that.  ;&#41;  I was a little surprised that even in Prime, he was getting cruddy gains in DEF -- perhaps Hares and Endure drills just don&#39;t mix?  &#40;Obviously, I never tried him in Swim.&#41;  I didn&#39;t bother maxxing out POW and SPD until he was on his stat downswing in the end, leaving them at ~950 until then.  At that point it didn&#39;t really matter any more. <BR> <BR>He cost about 100K to raise over his 8 years -- that was a LOT of items.  &#40;100 Mint Leaves, 99 Nuts Oils, one Smoked Snake, probably a couple dozen Candies and the rest was all Mangoes, plus the cost of 100 Tablets.&#41;  Needless to say, since he didn&#39;t do anything but drill, he didn&#39;t exactly earn his keep &#40;though he did find a boatload of Galoe Nuts and Flowers, of course&#41;.   <BR> <BR>The monster spent 80 weeks in Stage 1, 120 weeks in Stage 2, 120 weeks in Prime, and 80 weeks in Old Age -- the latter part of Prime had a slight drop-off in stats &#40;as was expected, as RNA and others have reported stat-gain fluctuations within the main three stages&#41;, but Week 321 was the first with a noticeable drop &#40;he started pulling 4s in Lif drills and 3s in Skill at that point&#41;.   I am intrigued that these stages worked out so nicely numbers-wise... and may repeat the experiment with a longer-lived or shorter-lived monster &#40;say, a Jill and a Monol&#41; to see if different lifespan classes have different lengths for stages, as I suspect.  Either that or my Jill/Kato that hit Stage 2 at 3 Years, 0 Months was a genetic freak.  ;&#41;  &#40;I know RNA reported that Wrackies &#40;the longest lived of all&#41; have very long childhoods.&#41; <BR> <BR>At any rate, I saved him on a different memory card at exactly one year to go in his lifespan -- just to see if I can make him the most improbable Big 4 winner that ever was.  I know it&#39;ll probably be the first E-Class monster to win the Elders&#39; Cup, and with one move &#40;1-2 Punch&#41; at that! <BR> <BR>This was a silly experiment, but I&#39;m happy to have been proven right about the rest issue.  It could have applications as an expensive but effective way to raise contenders through childhood -- if anyone else figures getting an extra 20 light drills out of an 80 week childhood is worth all that hassle, that is.  Hey, it couldn&#39;t hurt anything but the bank balance, as it&#39;s demonstrably not bad for the monster&#39;s lifespan! <BR> <BR>Next up: optimizing it further, and trying to sneak an occasional Hard Drill into Week 2s.  :&#41;
