<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'steven_morton'-!>
Ever wonder what those little white flowers do, besides take up space in your inventory?  Some of you may have heard rumours that they relieve stress if held in the inventory. Well, guess what? <BR> <BR><B>They&#39;re true!</B> <BR> <BR>The question now is, &#34;How much stress does it cure, and how much would it help my monster?&#34; <BR> <BR>The answer is, unfortunately, not much. <BR> <BR>The flowers relieve stress in much the same manner as a Gemini Pot, only not as effective.  The effects are determined at the beginning of each month, before you are asked to feed your monster .  The amount of stress relieved depends on the monsters stress level at that time. <BR> <BR>0-49 stress  = no effect <BR>50 - 99 stress = -1 to Stress <BR>100 stress = -2 to Stress <BR> <BR>Are the effects of the flowers culmulative? <BR> <BR>Yes, but as with the Gemini Pots, there is a catch.  The effect of each additional flower is determined in succession, not all to once.  To explain it better, here in example: <BR> <BR>Say the rancher has 10 flowers in his/her inventory at the beginning of the month and his/her monster&#39;s stress is at 52.  After the effects of the flowers are determined,  the monster will have a stress of 49. <BR> <BR>Only 49?  Why?  Because the effect of each flower is determined one at a time, not all to once. <BR> <BR>1st flower:  52 Stress, -1 Stress <BR>2nd flower:  51 Stress, -1 Stress <BR>3rd flower:  50 Stress, -1 Stress <BR>4th flower:  49 Stress, no effect <BR>5th flower:  49 Stress, no effect <BR>6th flower:  49 Stress, no effect <BR>7th flower:  49 Stress, no effect <BR>8th flower:  49 Stress, no effect <BR>9th flower:  49 Stress, no effect <BR>10th flower: 49 Stress, no effect <BR> <BR>Get the picture? <BR> <BR>My conclusions:  Since the monster is already well into the realm of lifespan loss before the flowers kick in, and by their nature CANNOT take the stress down out of the danger zone,  my conclusion is that they, like the Gemini Pots, are worthless.  Keep &#39;em if you want, but I suggest selling them to make room in your inventory.

 one more question.  my jilt asks for them, about twice a month.  if i give it to her, do i get a -1 stress on the spot?  or do they only have an effect if held in inventory?

 The flowers you give to her will drop her stress by 1.

 Hey, great work, DP! My compliments to the coder! Well, wasn&#39;t as helpful as I might have hoped, but at least we know what they do, now. And you have to admit: for something that your monster just happens to bring you, it at least does _something_ in your inventory.
