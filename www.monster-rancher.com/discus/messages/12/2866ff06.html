 I noticed someone asking about raising monols. And just below, I noticed another somone &#40;boy, we sure have a lot of Anonymous folks here!&#41; saying they had a thing against Monols. Well, being the lover of unloved monsters, I figure that _someone_ has to stand up for the Monols! <BR> <BR>Alright, alright. So there isn&#39;t as much to stand up for as I&#39;d like. Monols are hideously slow, for one thing, with one of the worst speed gains in the entire game &#40;possibly the worst, I&#39;m not sure&#41;. Also, they have very short lifespans, making them generally an undesirable type with that, alone. However, as defense critters, you won&#39;t get any better. They take miniscule damage from physical attacks, and their defense gains are incredible all the way along. Also, they have very good intelligence, so they can keep their defense up in that area, as well as being good intelligence attackers. All in all, they&#39;re tanks. You build &#39;em up, and take the hits while dealing out your own.  <BR> <BR>The best thing, i find, to do with a Monol is to go for their &#39;Sonic attack&#39;. Not only is it a long-range attack, meaning you can hit stuff long before it can hit you, but it&#39;s a &#39;hit&#39; tech, so you can concentrate more on their intelligence and defense, without having to be concerned about getting Skill up as high. Also, it&#39;s an intelligence attack, so you&#39;ll be able to pick away at the enemy for a lot of damage, even if the damage category is low. For my monols, this was always the god tech. In a fight, I generally suggest taking things in the &#39;tank&#39; method: take the hits, while dishing out your own damage as much as you can. In the later levels, it&#39;ll take its toll, but you can generally deal enmough to keep up with the creatures, if not doing better.  <BR> <BR>Combination-wise, it depends on what you want to go with. A Monol/Jell is one of the best, however, thanks to the plusses given in Defense &#40;which is a Monol&#39;s best stat, anyway&#41; as well as giving it a good base for intelligence. Monol/Pixie works well as well, although you&#39;ll find the defense won&#39;t be as strong, so go for the intelligence _big_ time.

 Simple: each different sub-breed brings their own look into the mix, as well as stats.  <BR> <BR>Besides, not everyone has the CD that makes Galaxies.

 Try raising an Obelisk.   Man, that&#39;s hell.   One of the  <BR>only time i hated this game was because of Monols. <BR> <BR>You know,if you want to stick up for an unloved  <BR>monster, try Knight Mocchi.  I know I want to strangle  <BR>one each time i see one.
