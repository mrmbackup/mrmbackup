 JLRs Method &#40;probably fixed&#41; <BR> <BR>STEP 1. Are you strapped with about $240,000? Are you some of those people who are not caring about reloading or saving a lot? And are you not caring about form that much? <BR>           If you picked yes for these 3 questions then this is the method for you!!! <BR> <BR>   For best results your monster must like Meat and Tablets! <BR>  <BR> NOTE : How the Magic Banana Works! The Magic Banana works by gaining 1 week  and losing  1 week. If you lose 10 loyalty you just got 1 week of life, but if you gain 10 loyalty you lose 1 week of life.                                                                                    <BR>    KEY: Mint Leaf - ML <BR>    Nuts Oil - NO                                                                                                            Magic banana - MB                                                                                                   Smocked Snake - SM   <BR>     None - candy, SM, Powder, MB. In place of none. <BR>    Light Drill - LD <BR>    Hard Drill - HD <BR>    Meat - Meat <BR>    Tablet - Tablet <BR>    Rest - Rest                                                                                                             STEP 2. You may need a couple of items like a Lump Of Ice, Gemni Pot, Sculpture, Golden Peach, Silver Peach&#42;, Fire Stone&#42;. And For sure you will NEED patience, And to RELOAD a lot. <BR> <BR>NOTE : A Golden Peach is found in ParePare Expedition, Silver Peach is found in Elders Cup, and Fire Stone and Silver peach are optional. <BR> <BR>STEP 3.
