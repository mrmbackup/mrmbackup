 Maxxed Monster Method &#40;revised&#41; <BR> <BR>Note:  This is not so much a new method as it is a compilation of all the things previously known. <BR>Many of the expert trainers will not need to read this as they already know.  This is mostly for  <BR>newer players with a lot of money. <BR> <BR>First off, this method is for people willing to spend some time on their monsters &#40;not TOO much <BR>a la DP&#39;s method&#41;. <BR> <BR>This is also for people who have plenty of spare cash, you&#39;ll be making it back, no worries there. <BR> <BR>This method requires multiple generations, if you&#39;re not down with that, catch up with the times. <BR> <BR>Train a wracky/mock &#40;preferably&#41;.  Get its life up to 750 and intelligence to 950.  Power is also  <BR>preferable.  Train the monster until 6 years 3 months.  Skill is also important.  Use it to get peaches from elder&#39;s cup.  Use it to get peaches on expeditions.  Use it to get 6 paradoxines from expeditions. <BR> <BR>Monster #1:  This monster will be trained using HD, LD, HD, LD for his entire life.  Always feed Tablet &#40;must be liked or at least tolerated, if not liked it will result in lifespan loss&#41;.  Numbers shown here, assumes NO relieves at least 25 fatigue, ML 1/2&#39;s stress round up the amount left and Tablet takes away 12 stress.  If number in brackets is over 70 lifespan is lost.  Hard drills &#40;HD&#41; add 15 fatigue and 12 stress and light drills &#40;LD&#41; <BR>add 10 fatigue and 5 stress.   <BR> <BR>HD 15/12 &#40;39&#41; <BR>ML LD 25/11 &#40;47&#41; <BR>NO HD 15/23 &#40;61&#41; <BR>ML LD 25/17 &#40;59&#41; <BR>Tablet  <BR>NO HD 15/17 &#40;49&#41; <BR>ML LD 25/14 &#40;53&#41; <BR>NO HD 15/26 &#40;67&#41; <BR>ML LD 25/18 &#40;61&#41; <BR>Tablet <BR>NO HD 15/18 &#40;51&#41; <BR>ML LD 25/14 &#40;53&#41;---- Same as last month. <BR> <BR>The stats will now start to repeat.  At the end of prime you will stop training this monster with this method. <BR>The new method will be: <BR> <BR>Tablet <BR>Rest <BR>NO, HD <BR>ML, HD <BR>ML, Rest <BR>Tablet <BR>Errantry <BR> <BR>Repeat. <BR> <BR>At this point you are no longer trying to preserve lifespan you are just trying to gain techs.  It&#39;s best to choose <BR>which techs you would like to have and get those.  This will help filter out the weaker moves.  Occassionally you <BR>may want to stop this method and do battle and freeze in order to unlock techs. &#40;thread = MR2, tech/tech chains,  <BR>technique chains version 3&#41; <BR> <BR>Monster #2 <BR>This monster you want to HD, LD, HD, LD its entire life.  Make the stats match up so that you are able to get a great combo. <BR>Make sure the stats are as high as possible.  Then combine, with the monster who has the techs first.  &#40;thread = MR2, breeding/combining, <BR>Look! Up in the sky...&#41; <BR> <BR>Monster #3 <BR> <BR>If you take the time to combine this monster should come out with high stats and all the techs you want, the most errantries you want to send this monster on is 2 and that is at the end of its life.  It is also preferable it has a type 3 lifespan or a longer lifespan, but not required... just watch for prime to be coming up. &#40;thread = MR2, FAQ: The most important game data, Monster Life Stages The Real Scoop!&#41; <BR> <BR>First six months of this monsters life will go: <BR> <BR>Tablet <BR>Paradox LD 10/5 &#40;20&#41; <BR>NO LD 10/10 &#40;30&#41; <BR>ML LD 20/10 &#40;40&#41; <BR>NO LD 10/15 &#40;40&#41; <BR>Tablet <BR>Paradox LD 20/8 &#40;36&#41; <BR>NO LD 10/13 &#40;36&#41; <BR>ML LD 20/12 &#40;44&#41; <BR>NO LD 10/17 &#40;44&#41; <BR>Tablet <BR>Paradox LD 20/10 &#40;40&#41; <BR>NO LD 10/15 &#40;40&#41; <BR>ML LD 20/13 &#40;46&#41; <BR>NO LD 10/18 &#40;46&#41; <BR>Tablet <BR>Paradox LD 20/11 <BR>NO LD 10/16 <BR>ML LD 20/13... repeating <BR> <BR>The method will then begin to loop.  You may want to use troron if A: your monster starts with high speed and/or defense or B: you&#39;re to lazy to get the paradoxine from expeditions.   <BR> <BR>After this use the standard HD, LD, HD, LD method outlined in the first monster.  Try to avearge the stats out.  When the monster gets out of prime, peach him &#40;or her&#41; to put him &#40;or her&#41; back into prime THE WEEK he &#40;or she&#41; gets out, but makes sure he&#39;s out.  Then continue with the method.  When both peaches have been used and  <BR>the monster is out of prime go for any techs you want to get that he didn&#39;t start with, try to keep the number of techs down.  After that do battle/freeze.   <BR> <BR>This is done by freezing your monster and only bringing it out to battle.  Get the monster to S class &#40;it should be strong enough&#41; as quickly as possible. Then beat S class and battle in the M4 tournies and Legends cup.  If you would like you can battle in the S class officials, but these are more time consuming &#40;in real life&#41; and seem to give slightly lower gains.  Give nuts oil after every tourney and freeze the monster.  After every battle the monster should get at least 30 total points up.  If not reset, you may set your number higher or lower depending on your level of patients.  Do this until the monster is maxxed &#40;950 in all stats and 999 in life&#41; or until it dies.  If the monster does not max, train another #2 monster to match it and try again. <BR> <BR>The method works even better with anything main or sub-type durahan, henger, or arrowhead.  Anything /wracky or kato&#40;including pure wracky and kato&#41;would also be good for this method.   <BR> <BR>Sorry if this post looks strange, but it was written in microsoft word.  I fixed what I could. <BR> <BR>Comments anyone?  Did I mess up on numbers anywhere?  Please feel free to post below to improve or add advice.

 I&#39;d recommend referring to the thread &#34;Correcting and combining, a hypothesis&#34; when it comes to combining.  That thread includes critical info on what it takes to make a great combo. <BR> <BR>I apologize if the thread seems confusing, but even I have a hard time keeping things straight sometimes.  Combining two monsters with similar attributes will save you a LOT of grief &#40;and quite a bit of boring math as well :P&#41; <BR> <BR>DP

 Oh!  Sorry, I thought I remembered that being the correct thread, guess I should&#39;ve read through it all again.

Oh, a simplified method for newer trainers.   <BR> <BR>HD = Hard Drill <BR>LD = Light Drill <BR>ML = Mint Leaf <BR>NO = Nuts Oil <BR> <BR>Week 1 NO, HD <BR>Week 2 ML, LD <BR>Week 3 NO, HD <BR>Week 4 ML, LD <BR>Tablet <BR>Repeat
