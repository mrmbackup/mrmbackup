 After burning myself a Skeleton disc, I tried it out, and it worked. Labeling the CD &#34;Skeleton&#34;, I put it away for later. After raising a few Naga, I decided to try Skeleton. I put it in the PlayStation, and out popped Purple Hare &#40;Hare/Naga&#41;! I quickly checked the CD; there is very little dust on it, but I &#34;cleaned&#34; it anyways with a soft cloth. I tried it again, and out came Skeleton!  <BR> <BR>Is Skeleton a more &#34;delicate&#34; monster than others? <BR>I&#39;ve used CDs in worse condition and gotten the same monster before....

Are you sure that you did not burn more data onto the CD? We have heard rumors of this before, but it always turns out to be a brother playing a trick, or a mislabeled disc. Does anyone else have access to your stuff at all? Another possiblity is that either the CD is old and the center hole is worn &amp; large so the CD slips in the drive, or that you PSX is old and all the discs slip because they are not held tighly on the center hub.  <BR> <BR>Knowing the way the shrine works, it isn&#39;t possible to have a CD change what monsters it makes under normal circumstances. <BR> <BR>What you should do is scan the disc with cloneCD, and look at the code it now makes, in the image.CCD file, and compare that code to the code for Skeleton.

 Actually things like this have happened to me before, I have a CD that makes a Tropical Ape half the time, and a pure Ape the other, but they have the same stats. also I burned a copy of the same CD and it only makes pure Apes, but the same stats

 Post the subcode and we will test it. <BR> <BR>But, first, try reading the Laboratory so you are thoroughly familiar with the shrine process. <BR> <BR>I have years of experience looking into these hoaxes, and researching the shrine itself. 0027, be aware that claims like this are grounds for being banned from this site. Before you put yourself out as an expert on a topic, you need to make sure you know something about that topic. It also helps to have done as much/more research on the topic as the person whom you have decided to correct.

 Also, would scratches cause the CD to be read differently?  or would it occur the same way every time with the scratch?

 Scratches do not affect the TOC. The only thing about scratches is that a disc can become so scratched the disc is unreadable, and two things will happen, either the machine wont read it, or it will do the &#34;Niton Trick&#34;. <BR> <BR>The Laboratory section outlines how to post the subcode, and why just copying a CD with a CD burner does not work.

 OK, as soon as I can figure it out I will do my best to post the subcode.  I wasn&#39;t trying to start a hoax or anything like that, or get banned, just added my 2 cents.  Sorry for any trouble again.

 Hey lisa, its been a while, but i, too, have had dusty CDs give off different monsters. My playstation was a little screwed up at the time, and it wouldn&#39;t read about 5% of the discs; it would make scratching noises when i put them in. Anyway, once or twice, it would make the scratching noise, and then start to read, and give me a monster. I took it out, cleaned it off, and tried again, and, IIRC, it didn&#39;t make the scratching noise the second time, but i would get a differnt monster. I never had that happen with the rares i burned, though

 djinn, the problem is that hundreds of people have shrined tens of thousands of cds during the 5 years that the 3 mr games have been around.  it is kind of late in the day for us to give credence to &#34;well, i kind of remember&#34; stories that are not specific to the cd involved, the monsters generated, or the timeframe involved.  i do not take pristine care of my discs or my ps or ps2, yet this sort of thing has never happened to me.  it has never been discussed by any credible poster for years and years either.

 ...Djinmaster, would the screen stop at the &#34;reading data now&#34; part and then in order to get the monter you&#39;d have to put in the MR2 disc at that point?

 Here&#39;s what I remember from actually BURNING my Skeleton CD. <BR> <BR>1. It was burning for 56 minutes when I stopped it. <BR>2. CloneCD froze up at &#34;4%&#34;. <BR>3. It&#39;s taking over half an hour to &#39;upload&#39; the CD. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll re-post in a few minutes, with the .CCD file.

 The playstation would pause for a much longer time than normal for the searching for CD data, or whatever it was, and then it would finally go through. The second time, however, it read at a normal speed. But, like i said previously, my playstation was having many problems at this time, especially with reading CDs &#40;Some PS games and all DVDs wouldn&#39;t play on my playstation&#41; so this reading problem may be the cause of it, i honestly don&#39;t know.

No. It is up to you to post the subcode for that particular pressing.  <BR> <BR>You might want to note that the other 2 people making this claim, in this thread, have not been able to post any sobcode for their supposed discs. Yet, we have years of research, and hundreds of thousands of discs shrined by tens of thousands of other players which proves these people to be incorrect. Until someone can prove our research wrong, we aren&#39;t going to simply trust newbies who can provide absolutely no proof. And, apparently from their other posts, have very little ranching experience. <BR> <BR>The rules are pretty simple, if you want to claim that the game does something which is completely contrary to years of research, it is up to you to prove the research wrong. If you keep insisting things which you cannot prove to us, you will be banned.  <BR> <BR>So, rather than expecting us to believe a story which could easily be based on a faulty memory, post the code now.

 For some reason, the sub-code isn&#39;t reading, I&#39;ll just sent you the CD, Ms. Shock. Would that be OK? I&#39;ll wait for permission before sending it. I am many things, but a liar isn&#39;t one of them.

 You can send it to me, my address is in the Parental Consent Form, in the Privacy Policy part of the Office Of The Mayor. <BR> <BR>AgMasamu, you have been a reliable poster in the past, and I suspect that in your case it was simply a case of faulty memory, or some other explainable mistake. But, I would be very interested in seeing the CD, and will either return it to you, or pay you for it.

 Please, keep the CD. It&#39;s a simple CD-R, with the Skeleton sub-code from this site burned onto it. Oddly enough tho, it says it has multiple songs on it when inserted in a CD player &#40;it even says there is over an hour of audio on it&#41;, but only plays one song, labeled simply number fifteen &#40;and refuses to change song number&#41;. Simply put, there is no need to send it back, or pay me for it.

Ok, I will look into it. <BR> <BR>8/10/2002 Update: I have receieved the disc, it is very densely covered with white lint. It makes a skeleton every time for me. I have shrined it over 100 times in each my PSX and PS2.
