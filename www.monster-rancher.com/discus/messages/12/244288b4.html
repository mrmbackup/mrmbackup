 This occured to me as I was raising my Worm for the last Battle Strategies post, but I wanted to see if anyone else had thought of this... <BR> <BR>We all know how a Worm can hatch into an different main-type, right?  And that its techniques change appropriately, giving you the same number of moves in its new form as in the old?  Well, a Worm has a total of 15 moves, and only 3 of them need Tech Chains to be acquired.  You can probably see where I&#39;m heading with this- there are several monsters in the game who are a pain to fill out their move lists &#40;Pixie, Gali, Zuum, Golem, etc.&#41;.  If you have a Worm metamorphose into one of those main-types, you can get several chained &#40;or possibly even Type-specific&#41; moves without the hassle of all the battles involved!  Furthermore, if it turns into something like a Pixie or Tiger, whose stat-gains are almost the opposite of the Worm&#39;s, you have probably the best Combining fodder in the game! <BR> <BR>Any thoughts?

 hmmmm,... all I know is that in raising the beaclon I have from worms on this brand new game,.. I am indeed having secind thoughts on a worm as one of the greats,...  I still have yet to try to make it hatch into something else,..   but  I was trying to raise a beaclon to be of near perfect status,.. and so I started raising a line of Rock worms,.. adn they seemed to do wonders,..  it takes a while to get them going as monsters,..  but once they begin a rollin&#39;,... get out of the way,...  but i do agree with you on teh possible conversions, so I am looking forward to others&#39; input on having the worms hatch into diefferent mains,..  but has anyone figured out what decides what main they will hatch into???   or example if you start out with a worm/worm???    <BR> <BR>oh well,  i will look again soon

 There doesn&#39;t seem to be any real link to the main. Slim Shady tried it, and saved and reset &#40;I was completely caught off-guard by my worm&#39;s cocooning!&#41; and got several different mains by just resetting. As I recall, he got Naga, Gali, and Pixie...but, please check his comments on the topic!
