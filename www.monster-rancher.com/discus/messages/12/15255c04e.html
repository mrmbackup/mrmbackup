 Okay okay. Most of us have read the lifespan theories on here, and it was concluded that Lifespan is percent based, and giving a monster a peach will turn its clock back. Therefore, giving a monster a Peach at Week 1 wouldn&#39;t do anything, right? Apparently, thats wrong. <BR> <BR>&#34;What?&#34; you may ask. Well, according to the results I have, its true. &#34;But, how can you tell it has an effect?&#34; It&#39;d be hard to raise a monster EXACTLY the same twice in a row, and Sueki Suezos won&#39;t accept items. But I stumbled onto a way to test it: Non-Existant monsters. <BR> <BR>In short, a monster that doesn&#39;t &#34;exist&#34; in the game. Basically, a mosnter that has a sub-type it shouldn&#39;t have. Like, a Mew/Dragon, or a Phoenix/Mocchi. To obtain on of these, use a Gameshark or similar cheating device and put in codes to auto-change the monster&#39;s main and sub. Then just create a new monster &#40;Via Market, Shrine, or combining.&#41; The resulting monster will be mostly invisible... besides a few pixels that outline what it should look like. <BR> <BR>These non-existant monsters have no programming, so they start with base stats of 1, gains of 1, a lifespan of 1 week, and strangely, ALL of their main&#39;s possible techs. Now whats the point of all this? To create a monster that NATURALLY only will live one, single week. <BR> <BR>Giving the Monster a peach WILL increase its Lifespan accordingly, so it seems that peaches either DO add 25/50 weeks to lifespan totals... Or they subtract the Current Week value... Meaning you&#39;d be in negative weeks if used early. <BR> <BR>Once again, we have a mystery about lifespan.

 I never tried feeding a monster a peach at day 1... <BR> <BR>That said, it&#39;s only sort of percent based.  At birth the monster&#39;s lifespan, and lifestages are calculated.  However, lifespan hits only affect the current lifestage.  For example, I always do errantries when young... or old, so that the monster&#39;s prime doesn&#39;t lose any time.  I always feed peaches half a year and a year after the monster enters prime &#40;depending on if it&#39;s a silver or gold&#41; to go back to the beginning of the monster&#39;s prime.

 I was always under the impression that the peach just took you back 25/50 weeks, and if for example a Gold  <BR>Peach was taken at 7 weeks old you would just have to put up with another 43 weeks of Stage 1, going into   <BR>negatives didn&#39;t negate the effect. Can&#39;t find that written down anywhere, but that was the impression that I  <BR>got.

 I know, but what I&#39;m saying here is that its something new that &#40;I think&#41; we didn&#39;t know before. <BR>And its also been observed that if you battle enough during prime &#40;why you&#39;d do so is beyond me&#41; that a peach will almost always shrink you. <BR> <BR>All I&#39;m saying is that peaches don&#39;t exactly work the way we think.

 I&#39;m currently battling all of the way through prime with my Cinder Bird &#40;it&#39;s a moneymaker, about the only  <BR>explanation I can think of&#41;. No other reasons why you should though, unless you&#39;re short on cash. <BR> <BR>On a separate moneymaker notice, at B rank with the FIMBA meet you just gotta love those 3 B&#39;s in 3 weeks.

 Haha! Yes, when you have 3 straight weeks of battling in B class. Isn&#39;t there another month that does that too? I think it involved to Dragon Tusk Cup.

 Yeah, the Dragon tourney&#39;s part of it &#40;Aug 2,3 and 4&#41;. Still, I think we&#39;re sort of drifting away from the  <BR>topic here...
