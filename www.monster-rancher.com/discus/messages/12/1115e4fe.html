Ever wonder what your effect your actions and the items have on your monster?  With the help of a Gameshark Pro and Xianaix&#39;s code guide, I located the memory locations that govern your monster&#39;s fatigue, stress, loyalty, form and nature.  Using these tools an info, I have begun a project to discover just exactly what effect certains actions and items have on a monster. <BR> <BR>Before beginning, I&#39;ll explain some things about the values themselves. <BR> <BR>STRESS AND FATIGUE <BR> <BR>Stress and Fatigue are rated on a scale of 0 - 100. 0 = no stress/fatigue  100 = max stress/fatigue.  This value is altered by items that you give your monster, your actions while raising the monster, stable size, and certain items in your possession.  Here are some scales to illustrate. <BR> <BR>Stress <BR> <BR>0 &#40;no stress&#41; -&#40;===================&#41;-100 &#40;runaway&#41; <BR> <BR>Fatigue <BR> <BR>0 &#40;very well&#41; -&#40;===================&#41;-100 &#40;sickness&#41; <BR> <BR>The closer the stress and fatigue values are to the high end of the spectrum, the greater the danger of the monster running away/getting sick. <BR> <BR>LOYALTY AND RAISING STYLE <BR> <BR>Loyalty in Monster Rancher 2 is actually determined by two values, Spoil and Fear.  Both of these values are rated from 0 - 100 and loyalty is calculated by determining the average of these two values.  Raising style is also influenced by these values.  The relationship of these two values determine your raising style, as shown by this chart. <BR> <BR>Spoil much greater than Fear = Doting <BR>Spoil somewhat greater than Fear = Fond <BR>Spoil slightly greater than Fear = Soft <BR>Spoil and Fear are roughly equal = Even <BR>Fear slightly greater than Spoil = Strict <BR>Fear somewhat greater than Spoil = Harsh <BR>Fear much greater than Spoil = Spartan <BR> <BR>Note that this dual loyalty system is why trainers that spoil their monsters have trouble getting their monster&#39;s loyalty much beyond 50. <BR> <BR>FORM <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know much yet on how form affect your monster&#39;s performance &#40; I&#39;ll do some experiments on this in the future&#41;,  but I do know that Form is rated on a scale of -100 to &#43;100,  illustrated here. <BR> <BR>&#40;-100,  Skinny&#41;-&#40;======&#40;0,  Normal&#41;========&#41;-&#40;&#43;100, Plump&#41; <BR> <BR>NATURE <BR> <BR>The monster&#39;s nature is also rated on a scale form -100 to &#43;100, shown here. <BR> <BR>&#40;-100, Worst&#41;-&#40;=========&#40;0, Neutral&#41;===========&#41;-&#40;&#43;100, Best&#41; <BR> <BR>This value, naturally, determines your monster&#39;s general attitude. <BR> <BR>Well, now to the list... <BR> <BR>ITEMS <BR> <BR>Using the info above, this list shows the effects of various items on your monster.  <BR> <BR>Mango   -10 Fatigue, &#43;1 Form, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear <BR>Candy  -  -2 Stress, &#43;10 Form, &#43;1 Spoil <BR>Smoked Snake  -  -10 Spoil, &#43;20 Fear, -10 Form <BR>Apple Cake  - &#43;10 Spoil, -5 Fear, &#43;10 Form <BR>Mint Leaf  - Stress reduced by 50%, -5 Form, -2 Spoil <BR>Powder  - &#43;5 Fatigue, -24 Form <BR>Sweet Jelly  -  &#43;5 Form, -33 &#40;?&#41;&#42; <BR>Sour Jelly   - &#43;5 Form, &#43;33 &#40;?&#41; &#42; <BR>Nuts Oil  -  -28 Fatigue, &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear <BR>Star Prune  -  &#43;20 Fame, &#43;5 Spoil, &#43;1 Form <BR>Half Eaten  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Irritator  -  &#43;5 Fatigue,  &#43;15 Stress, -1 Form <BR>Griever  -  &#43;10 Fatigue, Stress reduced by 40%, -1 Form <BR>Bay Shrimp  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Incense  -  -1 Stress <BR>Shoes  -  -1 Stress <BR>Rice Cracker  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Olive Oil  -  -1 Stress, &#43;1 Form <BR>Kaleidoscope  -  -1 Stress <BR>Torles Water  -  -1 Stress <BR>Perfume  -  -1 Stress <BR>Stick  -  -1 Stress <BR>Bone  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Perfume Oil  -  -2 Stress, &#43;5 Form <BR>Wool Ball  -  -1 Stress <BR>Cedar Log  -  -1 Stress <BR>Pile of Meat  -  &#43;12 Form <BR>Soil  -  -1 Stress <BR>Rock Candy  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Dummy  -  -1 Stress <BR>Ice of Papas  -  -1 Stress <BR>Grease  -  -1 Stress <BR>Parepare Tea  -  -1 Stress, &#43;1 Form <BR>Match  -  -1 Stress <BR>Toothpick  -  -1 Stress <BR>Playmate  -  -1 Stress <BR>Polish  -  -1 Stress <BR>Silk Cloth  -  -1 Stress <BR>Disc Dish  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Gramophone  -  -1 Stress <BR>Steamed Bun  -  &#43;2 Form <BR>Razor Blade  -  -1 Stress <BR>Ice Candy  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Sun Lamp  -  -1 Stress <BR>Silk Hat  -  -1 Stress <BR>Half Cake  -  &#43;5 Spoil, -2 Fear, &#43;5 Form <BR>Shaved Ice  -  -12 Stress, &#43;1 Form <BR>Sweet Potato  -  -5 Stress, &#43;10 Form <BR>Colart Tea  -  -5 Stress, &#43;5 Form <BR>Galoe Nut  -  -1 Form <BR>Stick of Ice  -  -1 Stress <BR>Clay Doll  -  -1 Stress <BR>Mock Nut  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Fish Bone  -  &#43;1 Form <BR>Colt&#39;s Cake  -  &#43;15 Form <BR> <BR>Larox: &#43;10 Pow, &#43;10 Def, -10 Lif. -4 weeks lifespan total <BR>Manseitan: &#43;10 Lif, &#43;10 Ski, -10 Spd. -5 weeks lifespan total <BR>Troron: &#43;10 Pow, &#43;5 Ski. -10 weeks lifespan <BR>Paradoxine: &#43;30 Pow, &#43;30 Ski, -10% Spd, -10% Def. -18 weeks lifespan <BR>Nageel: &#43;50% Ski, &#43;50% Def. -20 weeks lifespan <BR>Kasseitan: &#43;50% Pow, &#43;50% Spd. -20 weeks lifespan <BR>Teromeann: &#43;50% Pow, &#43;100% Spd. -20 weeks lifespan <BR> <BR>&#42;  -  This is weird,  while examines the effects of these items,  I found that, contrary to popular belief,  Sweet and Sour Jellies do NOT directly affect the monster&#39;s nature.  Instead, I found that it influenced ANOTHER value that I didn&#39;t know existed until I started this project.  I don&#39;t know exacly what it does, but what I do know that Sweet Jellies drop this value by 33,  while Sour Jellies raise it by 33.  Any ideas as to this value might represent? <BR> <BR> This list is not complete but I&#39;ll be adding to this as I gather more info.  Check back here from time to time for updates.  Hope this guide helps you:&#41;

 this is a great list, dark phoenix!  one omission i notice right away is seaweed - my undines were always finding it, and i was always feeding it right back to them just to get it out of my &#91;typically bursting at the seams&#93; item closet.

 Fantastic!!!! I was wondering about Seaweed myself. <BR> <BR>I do have to differ with you on the Sweet/Sour Jellies. They have got to effect the nature. I can&#39;t see any other way around it. When I feed them, I get the effect I want on nature, and the effect I typically don&#39;t want on Form.

 Maybe B&#39;s Conclusion#3 on jellies was the closest.Jellies sometimes seem to trigger a cheat/great on drills.Nature is then affected by the trainers decision. It seems like 5 jellies plus 1 or 2 events move one position in nature.Without an event,it takes up to 10.In that case,something else must be happening. <BR> <BR> This one gets printed for the folder.Thanks again,DP!

 I&#39;ve found that altering the mystery value affects nature as well.  Adding to it shifts it towards Good and lowering it shifts it to Bad.  It&#39;s also interesting to note that some breeds can only get so good or so bad.  In other words, if you&#39;re trying to make your Joker into a saint, forget it:&#41;

 Why do smoked snakes always lower the loyalty of my monsters? The item list here shows smoked snake as plus 20 fear, minus 10 spoil. That should lead to an increase of 5 loyalty. Or is the formula for loyalty more complicated than just a simple average? On the other hand, mint leaf always lowers the loyalty of my monsters by 1, as would be expected if its the average of fear and spoil.

 It should increase loyalty, and I have seen it work at least once with much better results than 5 points &#40;almost 15 as I recall&#41;. In attempting to get a Beaclon, early on before a lot was known about the game, people had a lot of trouble with the loyalty requirement. Now we know to just feed a few snakes to fix the problem.

 Actually, I have to go with Mr. Horrible &#40;love the name, BTW ^_-&#41; on this one. I&#39;ve had a few times where a Smoked Snake lowered the loyalty of my monster, without turning it from Easy to Even. I figured that it was because the hit to fear was making it less-loyal as well. Of course, it was never a huge hit &#40;that I can ermember&#41; but it&#39;s almost always a hit, if the monster doesn&#39;t adjust its attitude.

 It depends of factors I don&#39;t really know. I raise almost exclusively evil monsters so I use a lot of Smoked Snakes. Sometimes it lowers loyalty, sometimes it increases it.

 I&#39;m guessing that it depends on a lot of factors for loyalty. I would say that Age &amp; nature of monster would have a lot to do with it

 So is it the affects of the smoked snake that vary, or the is the formula for loyalty more complicated than just &#40;spoil &#43; fear&#41;/2 ? It seems to me that its the snakes that vary, as the results from other items seem much more consistent. Most of my monsters are good, and range from even to doting in raising style &#40;doting are older ones I raised before I found this site&#41;. The results I&#39;ve seen range from no change to a drop of 10 points. It doesn&#39;t seem to correlate simply with raising style, but my guess would be that smoked snakes are similar to the affects of scolding. &#40;Somewhere on these boards is a post showing that the affects of scolding vary by style.&#41; Is anyone interested in doing some more research for accurate numbers on this item?

 You must also remember, Mr. Horrible, that both Spoil and Fear cannot go above 100 or below zero.  If your spoil is at or close to zero, the loyalty can&#39;t go anywhere but up because the spoil factor can&#39;t be below zero, so only the &#43;20 Fear is counted.  Likewise, if Fear is close to 100, the loyalty will go down because most or all of the &#43;20 Fear is not counted because it can&#39;t go above 100, so only the -10 Spoil shows any affect.  I hope that makes sense.

 It does make sense. I tried thinking of it that way, but what I&#39;ve seen &#40;multiple times&#41; is smoked snake lowering the loyalty of monsters who are at doting by 10. Doting is Spoil much greater than Fear, right? If spoil starts at even as small a number as 10 more than fear, and you add 20 fear and subtract 10 spoil, the worst that can happen is no change &#40;100 spoil, 90 fear&#41;. If doting represents a greater difference than 10, you can&#39;t even break even, it has to go up!  <BR> <BR>Ok, it&#39;s been a number of years since I took multivariate calculus, so maybe I am counting wrong. But the only set of numbers I can think of where a smoked snake would lower loyalty require fear to be greater than 80, and spoil less than or equal to fear. But I&#39;m seeing loyalty lowered when spoil is greater than fear, which just doesn&#39;t add up.
