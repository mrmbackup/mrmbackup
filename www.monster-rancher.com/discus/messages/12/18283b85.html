PART THREE:  General Raising Styles  <BR> <BR>The methods I use are based on the stress/fatigue numbers generated by Nevistar and Dark Phoenix, and are designed to maximize drills while avoiding Rest and lifespan hits.  Sounds logical, right?  Well, the advantage I had was having those numbers at my disposal.  There’s nothing <BR>WRONG with any of the other methods here per se, but some may need some tweaking to get around the lifespan problems.  RNA &#40;among others&#41; has ventured that all methods will end up looking about the same eventually, as there are only so many ways to raise a monster efficiently. <BR> <BR>Which methods you choose to use at any given point will depend on several variables -- which stats you need to raise, how well your monster is responding to Hard Drills, which stats are going up faster than others, etc.  Some general ideas based on the monsters’ life stages follow. <BR> <BR>&#42; General concepts <BR> <BR>A steady diet of items &#40;Mangoes, Nuts Oils, Tablets, etc.&#41; will tend to build Loyalty, as they add to both Spoil and Fear.  In general, your monster should be getting one item every week of its life.  Try to keep your monster as close to Even as possible, though you don’t need to be a total <BR>fanatic about it -- if it gets to Fond, give it a Smoked Snake.  Strict will tend to slip down to Even naturally if you treat your monster right. <BR> <BR>As far as behavior goes, I tend to respond to everything my monster does. If it gives me an opportunity to praise it &#40;a Great, finding an item, learning a tech, winning a battle&#41;, I praise it.  If it cheats, I scold it every time.  If it fails, unless I’m really worried about its stress <BR>at that point in a work cycle, I scold it.  This tends to keep its style around Even in the long run.  It’ll skew towards Soft at first, and Smoked Snakes can fix this if it gets out of hand. <BR> <BR>I try to keep Form at Normal as much as possible -- if it gets to Slim or Fat, it’s usually not that hard to correct it and keep your regular training schedules going.  In a worst-case scenario, there are usually times when you can slip in an extra Candy or Mint Leaf to push Form in the <BR>right direction.   <BR> <BR>&#42; Stage 1: Childhood <BR> <BR>Your monster will tend to be pretty terrible at raising any stats here, though after a couple of months its failure rate should drop quite a bit. Your main objective here is to raise Loyalty, so that it’ll be better behaved when it’s a little older and the serious drilling begins. <BR> <BR>My usual choice here is to train in SKI &#40;Shoot drills&#41; and nothing else. You won’t be fighting for quite some time, so you’ll have plenty of time to raise stats like LIF and POW/INT later on.  SKI has no Hard Drill of its own, and has only one HD where it’s a subtype &#40;where LIF has two of those&#41;. Plus, EVERY monster needs SKI.  Insufficient SKI means that your attacks whiff, which means you do no damage, which means you lose your battles. High SKI lets you get away with harder-hitting attacks.    <BR> <BR>At this point in your monster’s life, it won’t be building ANY stat up very efficiently.  So why not focus everything on the one stat you need the most AND you’ll have the hardest time raising later? <BR> <BR>Once your monster has stopped failing regularly and has a little Loyalty built up, there are a couple of things to consider here: <BR> <BR>1&#41;  This is often a very good time for Errantries.  It’s not as likely that your monster will have four successes in a row and fight a monster at the end &#40;much less be able to beat that monster if it DOES make it through&#41;, but the lifespan you’re losing from Errantries due to stress <BR>and fatigue is Stage 1 lifespan, which is the lowest stat-gain period and is a period you can AFFORD to lose.  If your stats are high enough -- and keep in mind that many attacks require minimum values, usu. multiples of 150 or close to them, to obtain them on errantry -- don’t be afraid to get as many attacks as you need in this period.  Specials will have to wait until B-Class, of course, but between the errantries and the attacks your monster started with &#40;if it was a combined monster, anyway&#41;, you should <BR>have nearly a full moveset before your monster reaches Prime, and have many of them in Childhood. <BR> <BR>2&#41;  Troron can be a good idea, under certain circumstances.  If your monster has a reasonably long lifespan, has POW attacks you’ll want to use and is <BR>not very good at raising POW in general &#40;think Mews, ColorPandoras, Wrackies, Metalners, Jells, Katos&#41;, doses of Troron in childhood can be very effective. <BR> <BR>Troron gives you &#43;10 POW and &#43;5 SKI for four weeks for each successful drill, at the cost of six penalty weeks of lifespan.  This means that if you’re not gaining ten points per week in drills, you’re coming out AHEAD using Troron.  If your monster is naturally good at raising POW, <BR>or if you’re raising an INT-monster and don’t care much about POW, don’t bother with Troron. <BR> <BR>Keep hammering away on SKI for as long as childhood lasts.  When you reach a point in childhood where your stat gains go up but your monster hasn’t grown yet, you can start mixing in an occasional hard drill.   <BR> <BR>&#42; Stage 2: Adolescence. <BR> <BR>This is the stage where you want to start hard-drilling regularly, as well as getting any remaining easily-obtainable attacks from errantries that you need.  &#40;Again, if you don’t NEED an attack, don’t waste the lifespan getting it, but if you do need it better to get it here than in Prime.&#41; <BR> <BR>Play around with the hard drills, and look at the stat-gains you’re getting. The odds are good that one drill will be returning higher gains than the others.  You should focus on that drill all through Adolescence and push it up just as high as you can get it, no matter what you’re doing to the stat the HD is slowly draining. <BR> <BR>The idea here is to take advantage of the “better” drills while there’s still a noticeable difference in the output.  If you’re getting 18s in Pull drills in Adolescence, you won’t be doing much better in Prime &#40;20s, of course&#41;.  But the same monster might be getting 11-12s in Leap in Adolescence where it would get 16-18s in Prime.  To maximize the effectiveness of drilling, therefore, pump up the drills that work the best in Adolescence and save your REAL peak training period &#40;Prime&#41; for the stats that are important but are a bit harder to raise. You’ll have plenty of time to max out your best stats later on. <BR> <BR>If you can take time out to beat the D-Class tournament here, do it; you’re not losing much in terms of training time to do so.  If you’re looking forward to your Special attacks and can beat the C-Class or B-Class tournaments, do it and go on the errantries NOW before you get to Prime, <BR>else save them for when your training peak is over. <BR> <BR>&#42; Stage 3: Prime. <BR> <BR>THE stage for stat-building.  By now you should have your fastest-growing stat very high, have at least 1500-2000 points overall, and have a regular training cycle in motion.  <BR> <BR>What stats you raise now are up to you: <BR> <BR>1&#41;  Your main attack stat, if it’s high enough &#40;700-800&#41; can wait.  You can fill it to max with light drills once you’ve gotten your other stats up. <BR> <BR>2&#41;  The Bunny methods have light drills in every work cycle.  These can be used to pump SKI up into the 800s, or &#40;once that’s done&#41; to add points to wherever they’re needed.  You can use them to offset the losses from HDs, <BR>for example, or to pump MORE points into the stat you’re trying to raise with HDs to make it go up that much faster.  Focus on SKI until it’s way up there, however -- you’ll thank yourself later.  <BR> <BR>3&#41;  It’s a rare monster that can get high SPD _and_ DEF -- but you need some of both, and definitely want to max out one or the other.  <BR> <BR>SPD will help keep you alive -- the opponents can’t KO what they can’t &#40;often&#41; hit.  They do get lucky now and then, of course.  DEF is more powerful in some ways, as it lets you go toe-to-toe and absorb hits as needed, but unless you’ve got it at 800-900&#43; you’ll be vulnerable to attacks based on your off-stat &#40;e.g. a monster with low INT can be <BR>nailed regardless of its DEF&#41;.  You can build both at once by mixing up Swim and Meditate drills, but one stat at 400 and one at 900 is better &#40;IMHO&#41; than both at 650.   <BR> <BR>4&#41;  LIF will tend to go up automatically thanks to Swim and Pull drills. If you’re really worried about it, you can use your light drills on Run once your SKI is high enough. <BR> <BR>In short, I try to build my main attack stat, SKI and either SPD or DEF up into the 800s at the very least.  Once you’re there, you can start focusing on the other defensive stat &#40;SPD or DEF&#41;, as any monster with all four of those attributes high will be nigh-unstoppable. <BR> <BR>Peaches should be used during this period.  I make a note of what month my monster grew to Prime in, then apply a Silver Peach six months later to warp it back to the beginning of Prime.  One year after THAT &#40;18 months after the beginning of Prime&#41;, I hit it with a Golden Peach to  <BR>warp it back again, giving you a full two and a half years of a peak training period.  That’s 15 repetitions of my two-month work cycles, which should have just about any stat you desire close to the top. <BR> <BR>&#42; Stage 4: Aging. <BR> <BR>Once you’ve gotten your monster’s stats built appropriately, it’s time to start shooting up the ranks.  If you haven’t beaten the B-Class tournament yet, do it, and get whatever Specials you need soon after.  Beat the <BR>S-Class tournament and then start racking up the Big 4 victories. <BR> <BR>At this point, you should be done with all your main HDs -- the stats should be thoroughly raised and the drills should be at three-stars. <BR>Use this time to HD the off-stats and use LDs to offset the losses, or to add levels to critical stats &#40;pumping POW/INT, SKI and SPD/DEF up 50 points at a time&#41;.  The bonuses for beating Big 4 tournaments will help significantly.  Ideally, you want your attack stat, SKI and either SPD or DEF at 900&#43;, hopefully 950&#43;, by the time you challenge the Legend Cup. <BR> <BR>If the HDs aren’t working out at this point &#40;i.e. if you’re not gaining enough points to make them worthwhile -- some monsters just won’t ever build their bad stats up high enough to make a difference&#41;, you can switch back to one of my more LD-intensive methods to pump the points <BR>wherever they’ll do the most good, i.e. into your stats where you can’t use HDs any more. <BR> <BR>Roll through the Big 4 until you reach the Legends Cup you want &#40;odd for Poritoka, even for Most&#41;, beat it, then keep pounding on the Big 4 to refill your bank account until it’s old and worn out.   <BR> <BR>The actual work cycles/training schedules are next...
