<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'torey_luvullo'-!>
Well I must say, I&#39;m glad that at least someone is successful at this horridly difficult game. Here are a few questions, thoughts, and some tips from an individual who has played this game more than he should have:  <BR> <BR>First with the questions: Bad monsters! Do the questions at the beginning of the game affect your ability to raise bad monsters. After some time playing MR2, i noticed that the opponents in the higher level classes tend to be &#34;bad&#34; monsters complete with their own move sets. For example, Ordorf the Gaboo has totally different techniques than Regretti the Gaboo, except that Ordorf is the &#34;evil&#34; monster. Right now all of my monsters have been &#34;best&#34; natured, and I would just like to see what it is like to be on the other side.  <BR>Side note: I think you can tell if a technique is exclusive to good/bad by examining it. It will look like a happy face if its a &#34;good&#34; technique and it will look demonic if its a &#34;evil&#34; technique. Im not sure if thats all together true, its just what I am guessing.  <BR>Thoughts: This game can really piss people off. I would just snap when I miss with 80% and the cpu hits with 15%. @#%@#%. Sorry folks, it has happened way too often...  <BR>Tips: here are some tips that have brought me some success.  <BR>When fighting an enemy, sometimes the best way to learn how to beat it is to actually use it, that way you will know what type of techniques are heavily damaging, accurate, withering, etc.  <BR>So once you know what your enemy is capable of, you can devise a strategy that revolves around the enemy using weaker attacks.  <BR>I&#39;ve noticed that the enemy usually attacks once its guts is 45&#43;. anything below that, they will stall until they have enough in which the AI thinks is wise to attack with. So either you can wither constantly to keep them from attacking or you can use a strategy that has brought me decent success, which is the following.  <BR>Try to find enemy techniques that require tons of guts and not accurate at the same time and try to provoke the enemy into using that technique. I know, it still may connect, but its an easy way to force the enemy into wasting guts.  <BR>If the enemy has high skill, always find its weakest attack and stay there. High guts moves are usually VERY devastating, so its best that you stay in the range of the &#34;weaker&#34; moves.  <BR>On big tourneys, dont be afraid to use Kasseitan or Nageel. Both work wonders...  <BR>I find saving guts is very effective. The damage difference between launching an attack at 30 guts and 99 guts is quite significant. Just make sure the opponent is a withering specialist  <BR>Flame me if you want, but any monster who lacks a &#34;A&#34; force move isnt worth raising... well, maybe &#34;B&#34; force is adequate as well.  <BR>final meaningless tip: The invitationals are very tough and each contain 3 superpowered monsters compared to the single high powered monster found in MR1. So be prepared.  <BR>Well just my observations, tell me what you think.  <BR>keep up the good work MR2 fans, I appreciate what you are doing for the MR2 community, who knows, in time the mystery to success will be made known to all  <BR> <BR>-- Zoinks &#40;<A HREF="mailto:kboi513@icqmail.com">kboi513@icqmail.com</A>&#41;, September 27, 1999  <BR>Answers <BR>Just another tip that came to mind:  <BR>Fight as much as you can, especially in C, B, or A class. Fighting often will not only add gold to your ranch&#39;s coffers, but its also an excellent way to train your monster. The bonuses gained from successful fights in the C, B, A classes are quite nice and they are an excellent way to round out your monsters since the bonuses don&#39;t seem to be affected by a monster&#39;s intrinsic attributes.  <BR> <BR>-- Zoinks &#40;<A HREF="mailto:kboi513@icqmail.com">kboi513@icqmail.com</A>&#41;, September 27, 1999.  <BR> <BR>As for the fighting strategies... it really varies depending not only on what you&#39;re facing, but what you&#39;re using. I generally tend to build will and try to keep my opponent attacking me with weak techs so I have a better advantage, but with some monsters, going all out, staying totally out of range of the enemy, and other strategies may work better.  <BR>I totally agree that using a mosnter is the best way to find how to beat it. raise as many monsters as you can! Not only will you learn the tricks to each breed, but you&#39;ll gain more experience with the game as well.  <BR>I often use Kasseitan outside of tourneys too. It will boost training results for a full year.  <BR>I have to disagree about the &#39;A&#39; force opinion. My Henger ran through the M4 using only Slash Dash and Charge, both of which are C force. They are A and S to hit, repsectively.  <BR>Thanks for the tips, it&#39;s always nice to have other people&#39;s opinions.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell &#40;<A HREF="mailto:oriole@capital.net">oriole@capital.net</A>&#41;, September 27, 1999.  <BR> <BR>The only problem I find with using the Kasseitan or Nageel is that if the rules follow along with MR1, then using drugs decreases your monster&#39;s lifespan. Also, it will reduce the lifespan of a monster created from that monster. So, any time I get any kind of drug, I just sell it. Hell, being a fan of Pixie&#39;s and Dragon&#39;s, I need my monsters to live as long as possible. That&#39;s just my two cents worth.  <BR> <BR>-- Suji Sato &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Suji_Sato@yahoo.com">Suji_Sato@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, September 27, 1999.  <BR> <BR>&#42;blink-blink&#42; If it ain&#39;t the mad, fat, chick-killer himself. I gotta admit, I still avoid drugs like the plague. I can&#39;t help it, too many bad MR1 flashbacks.  <BR>Although...A friend of mine took one of his better monsters from the first game, and drugged it up until it was nearly maxed out. He then brought it over to MR2. As I remember, he suffered no ill effects. Something to try if you have the time and want a good head start.  <BR> <BR>-- Dr. Jovis &#40;<A HREF="mailto:jovis219@hotmail.com">jovis219@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, September 28, 1999.  <BR> <BR>I think alot of people are so worried about having a long living monster that they ignore what bonuses they can get from drugs. I have yet to test the drugs to see the exact penalties, but I&#39;ve had monsters use Kasseitan and live for over 5 years, so it can&#39;t be that bad. And look at what you get: &#43;1 to &#43;5 in each training. If you train 3 weeks out of a month, that&#39;s 36 weeks a year. that averages an extra 108 points. Okay, lets say Kasseitan drops your life span by... 3 months. That&#39;s a pretty big hit. But can you get 108 points in anything in three months? Oh, you say you&#39;re going to do the tough drills repeatedly? Sure, you can get alot of points, but the fatigue and stress those cause lowers life too.  <BR>Really, ruling something out just because it might lower your monster&#39;s life span is short-sighted. I did the same thing until I tried the Kasseitan... now I love it, because I know what it does. Really, we don&#39;t even know the exact life loss from the drugs... what if it was one week? They might have a good use then.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell &#40;<A HREF="mailto:oriole@capital.net">oriole@capital.net</A>&#41;, September 28, 1999.  <BR> <BR>So are you saying that these training drugs affect a year&#39;s worth of training, and not for just one errantry &#40;like in MR1&#41;? How often do you give them then to your monsters, once a year or once a lifetime?  <BR> <BR>-- The Souledgemaster &#40;<A HREF="mailto:souledgemaster@yahoo.com">souledgemaster@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, September 28, 1999.  <BR> <BR>I had a bad experience with a monster croaking at the age of 1yr 10mo , this was the first time I used drugs to enhance his performance, and they worked really well....so I&#39;m not certain if it was drugs or just the monster itself or the monsters I used to breed it...has anyone else noticed a dramatically early death. The monster was a purple worm &#40;worm/naga&#41;, and he was treated well &#40;ended up with an even rating&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- Skullplate &#40;<A HREF="mailto:mirus_prod@hotmail.com">mirus_prod@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, September 28, 1999.  <BR> <BR>Yes, Kasseitan has a year effect on your monster&#39;s training &#40;drills and errantry&#41;. I only use it once per lifetime, and not on every monster. I haven&#39;t tried any of the others.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell &#40;<A HREF="mailto:oriole@capital.net">oriole@capital.net</A>&#41;, September 28, 1999.
