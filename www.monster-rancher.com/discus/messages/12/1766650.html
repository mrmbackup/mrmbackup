Does battling affect your life span after your monster is an infant?  <BR> <BR>-- Harasta &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Necromancer11@aol.com">Necromancer11@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 02, 2000  <BR> <BR>Yes, it can improve it by removing stress before it even sets in. Some monsters have to fight every month to be stress-free, others can go for half a year without crawling into the ring. Regardless, regular combat experience will boost your monster&#39;s stats and prevent stress, and less stress = more lifespan. Just don&#39;t let your monster get KO&#39;d if you can possibly help it, and if it gets injured in battle, DEFINITELY reset.  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Tournaments shorten lifespan by 1-3 weeks, RNA can back me up on that one. You would be better off using mint leaves instead. It is more costly, but makes for a longer life.  <BR> <BR>-- Zack &#40;<A HREF="mailto:belgrath16@aol.com">belgrath16@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Mint Leaves, at least in my experience, can never PREVENT stress, they can only HEAL it once it happens &#40;usually on the first of the month&#41;. If I give my monster a Mint Leaf on the 4th of a month, no matter WHAT I feed him at the beginning of the next, he&#39;ll still get stressed out if he hasn&#39;t fought recently. And if they hurt lifespans so much....why did I get my first-generation Antares out to 5 years, 6 months &#40;not when he died, just when I combined him&#41; with him getting into more brawls than a drunken sailor? I believe some games are just programmed differently...  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>If you want the proof of battles affecting lifespan, then I&#39;ve got it.  <BR>1&#41; Read &#34;how do you ppl do it...&#34; in the &#34;raising/training&#34; category. Look at the very bottom, I have one case study and one science styled experiment in which results favoured my theory. Coincidentally, my testing was for a monster in its infant stage.  <BR>2&#41; I will use dark phoenix&#39;s wracky and mine for another example &#40;Good example&#41;. It is found under &#34;monster&#39;s life stages&#34; in the raising/training category.&#34; His wracky got to stage 2 at 3yrs 10 m. Mine got to stage 2 at 3yrs 8m. His lived for 9yrs 3m. mine lived for 10yrs 5m. The difference between the two? His has a record: 138W 2L 98KO. My wracky&#39;s record: 41W 0L 32KO  <BR>3&#41; Nate, the lifespan of your centaur is not as high as you think it is. Most monsters can get lifespans way past that if you battle less. The typical lifespans of my 1st gen monsters range from 5 - 10 yrs. 5yrs only happen to those monster that really suck at lifespan such as undine. Joker would probably be the same if I trained it. I have never heard of a centaur having crappy lifespan. However, I will eventually train them and find out anyways. My average monster lifespans are usually 6.5 years.  <BR>By the way, lifespan decreases 1 - 3 weeks in addition to the the week at tourney.  <BR>As for battling, my battling record usually averages around 80 wins. That should get you an idea of how much battling should get your lifespan average to 6.5 years.  <BR>I had a 1st gen Durahan who had a record of 220W 0L 171KO. He only lived for 5yrs 6m old. He should&#39;ve lived for 8 years, as durahan&#39;s lifespans predict.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.

 No, no, no. That theory is wrong. When your monster gets really weakened in the battle then its life span drops. Not just from battling. You have to battle, thats the point of the game.

 l am gonna have to disagree with you about the more damage you have done to you decreases lifespan,...   the only way it does anything to you, is if you get wounded too much,...then you have to go to the hospital,... and that just turns into loss of weeks,.   but goign to battle itself costs you l think the total was three additional weeks

 Anonymous, you don&#39;t have to battle at all! It&#39;s not necessarily the point of the game. I&#39;ve raised monsters who never battled, and many who only battled twice - to get high enough rank to access all the errantries. If you&#39;re trying to get as much lifespan as possible, to raise a monster with high stats, battling wastes precious lifespan.

 Of course, if you&#39;re trying to see what every monster can do in terms of abilities &#40;like me&#41;, then frequent battling is a must for most monsters.  Sure, the ranching aspect of the game is great, but one of the biggest advantages MR has over Pokemon and any of its clones is the graphical detail, including the attack animations.  When I play a game, I like to see everything it has to offer, and hence, I&#39;ll sit through 50 Brow Smashes, Bangs, or Two Knocks to get the full experience.
