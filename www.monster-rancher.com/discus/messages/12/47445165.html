 First of all, I like numbers.  That&#39;s in answer to your probable first question:  &#34;Why the hell did you do this?&#34;  I saw all the numbers that are used in raising a critter, and I wanted to come up with an optimim method of raising a creature. <BR> <BR>Btw, feel free to nitpick, criticize, correct, or, more aptly, actually &#42;TEST&#42; this theory out.  My freezer&#39;s full of creatures, so I don&#39;t have a critter &#40;yet&#41; I can test this out on. <BR> <BR>Premise: <BR>I wanted to find a method that would be the most efficient overall without any unnecessary loss of life for a creature.  Further, I wanted to eliminate the requirement that the creature must like items &#40;such as tabs&#41;. <BR> <BR>Basic Detail: <BR>This method is actually a 2-month period of training.  Its life index peaks at month1week2 &#40;m1w2&#41;;  however, at that time, the life index still does not exceed the value of 70. <BR> <BR>Month 1: <BR>&#40;any food&#41; <BR>week 1:  &#40;any item that does not increase stress or fatigue;  you may want Nuts Oil if you&#39;ve done any activity not on this chart that increased fatigue&#41;, Hard Drill <BR>week 2:  Nuts Oil, HD <BR>week 3:  mint leaves, Rest <BR>week 4:  ML, HD <BR> <BR>Month 2: <BR>tabs <BR>week 1:  NO, HD <BR>week 2:  ML, Rest <BR>week 3:  &#40;any item that does not increase stress or fatigue&#41;, Light Drill <BR>week 4:  &#40;any item that does not increase stress or fatigue&#41; <BR> <BR>...And repeat. <BR> <BR>Advantages: <BR>This method is a bit less cost-heavy than other methods;  rather than relying on tabs every month &#40;at $500 a shot&#41;, it requires tabs every other month.  You could even substitute potatoes or an item the creature likes for the beginning of the cycle.  The calculated cost per month is $750/month &#40;as opposed to some methods, which may cost up to $1300/month&#41;. <BR> <BR>Disadvantages: <BR>This is a bit more complex than the other methods, since it requires a 2-month cycle, not a 1-month cycle.  Further, a simple mistake &#40;such as feeding the wrong item at the wrong date&#41; could result in life loss.  Also, events such as expeditions and tournaments are not calculated into this. <BR> <BR>Specific Details: <BR>Much of this was designed by available data.  Note that it is possible that this data is not accurate, or is out-of-date.  However, given the assumptions that the following items have the following minimal effects&#40;1&#41;: <BR> <BR>  Tabs:  -10s&#40;tress&#41; <BR>  Rest:  -33f&#40;atigue&#41;, -5s <BR>  Hard Drill:  &#43;15f, &#43;12s <BR>  Light Drill:  &#43;10f, &#43;5s <BR>  Mint Leaf:  -50%s <BR>  Nuts Oil:  -28f <BR> <BR>and that Life Index is calculated by &#91;&#40;fatigue&#41; &#43; 2 &#42; stress&#93;, each week would have the following calculations: <BR> <BR>month 1: <BR>&#40;fatigue = 0, stress = 0&#41;, -$0 <BR>&#40;any food&#41;, 0f/0s, -$0&#40;2&#41; <BR>week 1: <BR>&#40;any item&#41;, 0f/0s, -$0 <BR>HD, 15f/12s <BR>Life Index = 39 <BR> <BR>week 2: <BR>NO, 0f/12s, $-200 <BR>HD, 15f/12s <BR>Life Index = 63 &#40;highest peak&#41; <BR> <BR>week 3: <BR>ML, 15f/12s, $-400 <BR>Rest, 0f/7s <BR>LI = 14 <BR> <BR>week 4: <BR>ML, 0f/3s, $-600 <BR>HD, 15f/15s <BR>LI = 45 <BR> <BR>Month 2: <BR>&#40;15f/15s&#41; <BR>tabs, 15f/5s&#40;3&#41;, -$1100 <BR> <BR>Week 1: <BR>NO, 0f/5s, -$1300 <BR>HD, 15f/17s <BR>LI = 49 <BR> <BR>Week 2: <BR>ML, 15f/8s, $-1500 <BR>Rest, 0f/3s <BR>LI = 6 <BR> <BR>Week 3: <BR>&#40;any item&#41;, 0f/3s, $-1500 <BR>LD, 10f/8s <BR>LI = 26 <BR> <BR>Week 4: <BR>&#40;any item&#41;, 10f/8s, -$1500 <BR>Rest, 0f/0s <BR>LI = 0 <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41;  Recall that the premise is to use worst-case scenario;  thus, some items may have a stronger effect than listed. <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41;  I did not add this into the cost, simply because it is a variable amount;  you &#42;must&#42; feed your creature, and the lowest-cost food is Potatoes. <BR> <BR>&#40;3&#41;  I had noted a slight error in my math;  thus, I just now corrected the values, which lead to the removal of the need of a mint leaves.  I may need to review these values to see if I can optimize it even more. <BR> <BR>Effectiveness of Heavy Drills <BR>I am not actively aware of the exact details of the benefits and drawbacks between emphasis on Heavy and Light Drills, in respect to stats gain.  However, it has been my experience that HDs tend to give a higher stat boost in creatures whose &#34;specialities&#34; are in that drill.  Thus, the overall gain is better in HD.  This theory, though, has yet to be tested in relation to this raising method. <BR> <BR> <BR>--Cats

 Corrections already...!!! <BR> <BR>1&#41;  The basic notes, the last week, should be: <BR> <BR>week 4: &#40;any item that does not increase stress or fatigue&#41;, Rest <BR> <BR>2&#41;  I copied m1w2 incorrectly;  it should have read: <BR> <BR>week 2:  <BR>NO, 0f/12s, $-200  <BR>HD, 15f/24s  <BR>Life Index = 63 &#40;highest peak&#41;  <BR> <BR>  &#40;Note that still makes the following math correct&#41; <BR> <BR>--Cats

 Slight Update:  I was mistaken;  I had a critter I could test this on.  10 months, and raised very well.  I&#39;m collecting whatever stats I need while I&#39;m going along on him.  &#40;It&#39;s a Gaboo/Jell, who dislikes tabs and potatoes&#41;. <BR> <BR>I just made room in my freezer, so I hope to test this on other breeds. <BR> <BR>--Cats

 CatsGoDot, there is no reason why not to do that great raising method. I belive that this site should go on for as long as possible, with people like DP,Torey,Nate and you adding all the time to it. I have acctually been watching this site grow since it was established &#40;sad lil me&#41; and I have never seen such a dedicated and interesting bunch of people.yes, I know i`ve never met you people in my life, I just thought it would be a nice thing to say&#41;

 1&#41;  &#40;And realizing I&#39;m trying to say this as politely as possible--I realize that tone is not always conveyed over the &#39;Net&#41;:  It&#39;s &#34;Godot&#34;.  As in the Beckett play.  Not &#34;GoDot&#34;. <BR> <BR>  2&#41;  Yes, I&#39;ve been trying it out on my stubborn Gaboo with great results.  I&#39;ve written down as many stats as possible--each drill&#39;s result, etc.  And I&#39;m sure if this critter wasn&#39;t first-generation, he didn&#39;t hate tabs, I wasn&#39;t so focused on getting techs, and he wasn&#39;t the first batch raised this way &#40;I screwed up in a few spots that cost me life&#41;, he might have done better. <BR> <BR>  Good enough for Mr. Fenrick&#39;s tourney?  No.  But definately good enough to win a silver peach. I&#39;m still raising him, and at 6y3m&#43; he&#39;s just entering his adult/final stage.  &#40;he&#39;s pulling good stats from drills, but not as good as in his prime&#41;. <BR> <BR>  Once I raise a few more &#40;I&#39;ve got 3 ready to test out&#41;, I&#39;ll post the results. <BR> <BR>  If you want, Mr. Bean, try this out and let us know how it works.  It&#39;s the cheapest monster I&#39;ve raised since I got into the $50k bracket a long time ago.   <BR> <BR>  3&#41;  Btw, thank you for the kind words &#40;since I &#42;am&#42; including in them&#41;.  Yes, Lisa and the gang work hard here, and is the shining gem of the Monster Rancher community.   <BR> <BR>  4&#41;  I&#39;m also glad that someone responded to this!!  I&#39;ve gotten NO feedback, but I assume that&#39;s because everyone has their own raising method.  Whatever.   <BR> <BR>--Cats

 ya, cats - i take &#91;4&#93; to heart.  i should have congratulated you on a well thought-out and useful method.  i am afraid i am a little burned out on methods right now, tho...actually, done to a crisp.  i&#39;m glad there are still people willing to try the new ones, tho.

 Hey, don&#39;t sweat it, torey.  I do appreciate the thought.  I wasn&#39;t that surprised by the lack of feedback--I believe it was said here several times that there are as many training methods are their are trainers.  Thus, this is little more than additional firewood to add to the pyre. <BR> <BR>  And, in all honesty, I deserve no congrats at all--not until this provides useful.  Yes, 1 critter has done well, and has been very low cost &#40;although he&#39;s at the point where I need to fight him, so my testing is over for him&#41;.  But until this method actually does show merit--if it provides a use for someone--this is nothing more than a complete waste of time on my part. <BR> <BR>--Cats

 Tell ya what, I&#39;ve got a test game where I sharked maximum cash specifically for testing training methods.  So, with cash not being a factor, I&#39;ll do a thorough test of this method tonight and post my findings tomorrow or the next day. <BR> <BR>Now, which one of my freezy pops to turn into the test subject, hmmm.....

 First Creature Result: <BR> <BR>Okay, the idea of charting out DeadLock &#40;Jelly Gaboo, a Gaboo/Jell&#41; didn&#39;t come to me until a little later in his raising, but early enough to write about.  I will spare you all the raising stats &#40;unless you really want to know, or find it useful for research&#41;. <BR> <BR>  Mind you, he didn&#39;t just disliked tabs...it was his STRONGEST dislike.  Also, I took him on &#42;a lot&#42; of errantries, and also messed up in the first 3 years &#40;I shouldn&#39;t have fed him potatos--raised stress, and it took its toll&#41;. <BR> <BR>  Year 0 Month 08:  161-132-96-97-138-118 <BR>  Year 1 Month 08:  206-146-127-144-182-156 <BR>  Year 1 Month 10:  211-155-134-151-189-168 <BR>  Year 2 Month 09:  267-236-189-195-215-239 <BR>  Year 3 Month 10:  368-336-206-265-299-398 <BR>  Year 4 Month 10:  426-390-205-307-306-558 <BR>  Year 6 Month 01:  504-434-204-343-410-713 <BR> <BR>  Hall of Fame material?  No.  And, mind you, it still had a few years left.  &#40;I needed it to fight now to make some money--it had just left it&#39;s prime in 6y2m, so it was still getting good stats in drills&#41;.  However, it was really good--rarely did I have to worry about it being spoiled, I had 3 slots every 2 months to feed it a peach/candy/snake/whatever &#40;without any loss&#41;.  And it easily won the Elder&#39;s Cup.  &#40;Which, I should note, he didn&#39;t take a silver peach until he won it for himself&#41;.  And, once again, a 2nd generation, combined with 2 1st generation straight-from-CD not raised critters. <BR> <BR>  I&#39;m going to make a worksheet to help myself out in raising and collecting stats &#40;for drills--helps out in identifying the creature&#39;s life&#41;.  If you would like a copy, email me and we can arrange something. <BR> <BR>--Cats

 I think I may have found a problem... <BR> <BR>Now, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but when I originally read your post, I figured you were going for as little item useage and cost as possible, while still getting a decent amount of drills in and controlling stress and fatigue so that no lifespan lost was incurred.  I also figured that you were operating on absolute worst case scenario...minimum restoration from rest, monster hates tablets, etc. <BR> <BR>Now, unless I missed something, here&#39;s your technique.  Please correct me if I misread it: <BR> <BR>Even Months:  Feed any food &#40;say, Fish, on average&#41; <BR>Week 1:  Any item, Heavy Drill <BR>Week 2:  Nuts Oil, Heavy Drill <BR>Week 3:  Mint Leaf, Rest <BR>Week 4:  Mint Leaf, Heavy Drill <BR> <BR>Odd Months:  Feed Tablets <BR>Week 1:  Nuts Oil, Heavy Drill <BR>Week 2:  Mint Leaf, Rest <BR>Week 3:  Any item, Light Drill <BR>Week 4:  Any item, Rest <BR> <BR>Repeat, repeat, repeat... <BR> <BR>I sat down this morning, just getting ready to raise a Zuum with this method to test it out.  I decided before I started to mathematically work out what his stress/fatigue levels were.  Here&#39;s what I got <BR> <BR>Assuming rest takes off ~30F and 5S <BR>Assuming Tabs takes off 10S <BR>Assuming ML takes off 1/2S, stress lost rounded down <BR>Assuming &#40;worst case&#41; food other than tabs reduces no fatigue/stress <BR> <BR>Month 1, 0/0, feed anything, 0/0 <BR>0/0    --  0/0   HD  15/12  LI= 39 <BR>15/12  NO  0/12  HD  15/24  LI= 63 <BR>15/24  ML  15/12 RT  0/7    LI= 14 <BR>0/7    ML  0/4   HD  15/16  LI= 47 <BR> <BR>Month 2, 15/16, feed Tablet, 15/6 <BR>15/6   NO  0/6   HD  15/18  LI= 51 <BR>15/18  ML  15/9  RT  0/4    LI= 8 <BR>0/4    --  0/4   LD  10/9   LI= 28 <BR>10/9   --  10/9  RT  0/4    LI= 8 <BR> <BR>Month 3, 0/4, feed anything, 0/4 <BR>0/4    --  0/4   HD  15/16  LI= 47 <BR>15/16  NO  0/16  HD  15/28  &#42;&#42;&#42;LI= 71!&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>15/28  ML  15/14 RT  0/9    LI= 18 <BR>0/9    ML  0/5   HD  15/17  LI= 49 <BR> <BR>Month 4, 15/17, feed Tabs, 15/7 <BR>15/7   NO  0/7   HD  15/19  LI= 53 <BR>15/19  ML  15/10 RT  0/5    LI= 10 <BR>0/5    --  0/5   LD  10/10  LI= 30 <BR>10/10  --  10/10 RT  0/5    LI= 10 <BR> <BR>Month 5, 0/5, feed anything, 0/5 <BR>0/5    --  0/5   HD  15/17  LI= 49 <BR>15/17  NO  0/17  HD  15/29  &#42;&#42;&#42;LI= 73!&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>15/29  ML  15/15 RT  0/10   LI= 20 <BR>0/10   ML  0/5   HD  15/17  LI= 49 <BR>&#40;pattern stabilizes after month 5&#41; <BR> <BR>Every other month, your monster takes a 1 week lifespan hit at the beginning of week 3. <BR> <BR>Granted, this isn&#39;t a very big loss.  Every year you&#39;ll lose 6 weeks of life due to lifespan hits, which amounts to a little more than a year if your monster lives 10 years.  But that&#39;s a year of training that could boost your monster considerably. <BR> <BR>The good thing is, your method keeps the costs down.  It averages out to be about 800 bucks a month, compared to 1300 a month for the method I usually use.  And, there&#39;s a simple quick fix that won&#39;t jack your costs up that much.  Stick in a mint leaf on the 4th week of every even month, and the stress problem is controlled, eliminating the lifespan hits.  Average cost raises to 900 a month, and your monster gets roundabouts an extra year of life. <BR> <BR>Now, all of this is assuming I read your method correctly to begin with, and assuming worst case scenario.  Since rest won&#39;t always reduce only 5 stress, it&#39;s entirely possible that you&#39;ll never take the lifespan hits, but if you wanna fix it so that, worst case scenario, LI never exceeds 70, might wanna stick in that other mint leaf. <BR> <BR>Unless you have a lump of ice, or a fire stone, of course.  In which case, this method works absolutely perfectly, no extra mint leaf needed. <BR> <BR>The save game that I have that I&#39;m gonna test it on does have a lump of ice for the held affect, so I&#39;ll try your method as-is tonight and post my monster results tomorrow. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps ya!

When I had read the mint leaves reduce stress by half, rounding down, I had assumed that it meant that it would round the value &#42;down&#42; &#40;and it all depends on programming implementation;  my guess is that it would, but if they threw in a ::round&#40;&#41; or even a ::ceil&#40;&#41;, well...&#41; <BR> <BR>And since I&#39;ve got all the stress reducers &#40;even the Dinos Tail--sorry, I&#39;m gonna wait a little longer until the known research is established&#41;, it never would have shown up on my test case. <BR> <BR>So, the real question is:  for the quality of your monster, would $800/month reasonable?  Do you think a beginning &#40;or a cash-strapped&#41; trainer would find this useful? <BR> <BR>Btw, DarkPhoenix or anyone who&#39;s more familiar with the effects of mint leaves, would you care to answer this?  Is it rounded &#42;up&#42; or rounded &#42;down&#42;? <BR> <BR>And as I&#39;ve posted, I&#39;ve got 3 others waiting to be trained &#40;at least 2--I don&#39;t remember which one the 3rd was, but I&#39;ve got a Ghost &#40;nth-generation, long ancestory, started off well&#41; and a Bronze Suezo &#40;off &#34;subcode&#34; here&#41;&#41;.  I wanted to do some raising last night, but, as I said in chat, my life kinda picked up right now.  And I hope to raise these guys into their twilight years &#40;as opposed to raising them until they&#39;re out of their prime, and then fighting &amp; making $$&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW, Lisa:  Would it be best if this &#40;or other people&#39;s raising techniques&#41; is later posted into the MR2 section?  I know there&#39;s a subthread in there, but since this is  ...well...  new, and from a relatively-new comer, I wasn&#39;t sure if this should be posted in the cafe or in MR2. <BR> <BR>--Cats

 Well originally when I began developing my methods I was told to round down... 15/2 = 7. <BR> <BR>But Richard Ryle told me it meant round down the amount taken away... 15/2 = 15 - 7.5 = 15 -7 = 8 <BR> <BR>I still don&#39;t know what&#39;s right...

 Me either, and that&#39;s our big hangup.  If it rounds down remaining, there&#39;s no flaw with this method as is.  If it rounds off the amount taken away, then it has a slight, easily correctable, flaw. <BR> <BR>Either way, Cats, I&#39;m training a worst-case monster right now &#40;Gaboo....&#42;shudder&#42;&#41; and he looks like he&#39;s turning out pretty good.  I think your method definitely has merit, and the lower cost makes it perfect for a trainer who&#39;s on a fairly tight budget.  Definitely worth keeping.
