 OK so I know that whatever test I did here is very inconclusive for the fact that I have had it only happen around 10 times. Just thought I&#39;d share, and may spark a bit of those researcher vibes back for some people here lol? <BR> <BR>Let me first start by stating that, in the in-depth game mechanics research of Pokemon, I don&#39;t think any other game has ever been researched than that; the RNG manipulation to obtain perfect Pokemon consistently just goes to show that, where people can actually now control the exact stats/natures/whatever of a Pokemon they hatch/encounter when it is normally a process deemed &#39;random&#39;. <BR> <BR>ever since I learned of that, every game I&#39;ve been playing now that has an insane amount of randomness, I&#39;ve been trying out methods to try and mess with the RNG of the game in hopes of finding a somewhat wild method of getting better results more consistently than just being &#39;random&#39;. I won&#39;t cover the exact details. <BR> <BR>In this case with MR2, it just happened to me now, for 10 straight weeks of training; for some odd reason my Colorpandora at its prime was just continuously FAILING his Swim drills, or Cheating it, no matter how many reloads I do. It was stupid. It even came to a point I was reloading for 30 minutes just to get that Success. &#34;What gives?&#34; obviously I asked... <BR> <BR>Then the next few weeks I was getting so frustrated and bored reloading again so much that I actually began pressing Triangle on stuff rather than X, and repeatedly selecting drills and whatnot, random stuff. Then boom, in the week I did that, he received a Great. <BR> <BR>I was like &#34;...nah, coincidence.&#34; <BR> <BR>But it happened again the next week where he was failing his Swim drills like mad, even if the colorpandora was jumping when I selected the Swim Drill! <BR> <BR>What I then did was that I selected Swim Drill, pressed No, selected it again... until I pressed No on it 3 times. Then went on the Swim Drill for the 4th selection, and he ends up with a success or a great. <BR> <BR>Take note that for all 10 weeks, he was excessively failing his Swim Drills, making sure he failed at least 30 times for each week &#40;reloading&#41;, then doing the Select-No-Select-No-Select-No-Select-Yes rotation, immediately giving me a success for all 10 straight times. <BR> <BR>Yeah this is all a very outrageous claim. Again, I just wanted to share. But take note of my first paragraph above, where a game like Pokemon actually had researchers who were able to crack and manipulate the &#39;random&#39; number generator at will! &#40;using various factors like: frame activity, initial seed, system clock and date, system&#39;s MAC Address for DS version Pokemon&#41;

 heh, heh, heh....the game messes with your head like that! I usually won&#39;t look at something unless a member can get results 100 times. -Then I test it by doing 500-1000 times.
