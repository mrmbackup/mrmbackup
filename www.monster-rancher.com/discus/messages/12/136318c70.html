 When MR1 came out, I became a very popular girl among the powergamer friends who suddenly wanted to go through the game fast, but not so fast that it was pointless.  Not because I&#39;m a coder &#40;I wasn&#39;t at the time, and I don&#39;t do straight hex now&#41;, but because I understood parameters and could do hex conversions without a pad and paper. :-J <BR> <BR>One thing I determined very quickly about codes that affect stats, in pretty much any game, is that the coders aren&#39;t usually very precise about things; as long as what&#39;s on the screen is what they want, usually maxed, they don&#39;t worry too much about fallout.  In practice, this means that usually, they find the appropriate bit of code, and fill it with F&#39;s.  In games without a lot going on under the surface, that works fine. <BR> <BR>Not so much in MR, but there&#39;s an easy fix; rather than needing to shark the monster, train it once in each area, etc., just correct the codes.  Instead of leaving the last four digits &#40;the quantity part&#41; as FFFF, set them to whatever you actually want the stat to be.  If you want a maxed stat, that&#39;s 3E7 for 999.  No repairs required, the game doesn&#39;t notice a thing once you save and reset, and the monsters slate perfectly. <BR> <BR>It also gives you the option of &#34;boosting&#34; monsters a bit if you&#39;re not in the mood to raise six generations to get to the monster you want- or perhaps repairing monsters that you _thought_ you had balanced right for combining, but you screwed up the math somewhere.  Also good for when you only have one CD that gives you a certain breed, and it&#39;s pathetic stat-wise.  Personally, I only &#34;raise&#34; monsters that I have gotten their stats legitimately from CD forward, running them through the S-class battles and so on, but it&#39;s really nice _not_ to have to spend four game years raising a peach-getter.  Your Mileage May Vary. <BR> <BR>If anyone is interested in this form of micromanagement, most calculators will display in hex, or you can just do it as sort of a 16 times-table.  For benchmarks, these are the four-digit versions of common stat milestones.  <BR> <BR>999= 03E7 <BR>750= 02EE <BR>500= 01F4 <BR>250= 00FA <BR> <BR>Just thought that might be a useful contribution to the discussion about combinations of slating and sharking and so on. :-J <BR> <BR>FF

 Wow. This is actually very precise and very good information for those who want to work out exact numbers on monsters for combining experiments. It&#39;s possible that, using this, we could actually work out the precise numbers that come out with combinations. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have a Gameshark of my own or I would _love_ to experiment with this data some more. I may have to try and get a Gameshark and see if I can crack more of the combining code at some point. It&#39;d be nice to know how numbers are averaged out in a &#39;great&#39; combo with a few tests.
