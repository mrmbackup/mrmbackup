<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:Darkburner8790@aol.com>The D</A></B> on <B>Thursday, June 6, 2002 - 06:07 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
I got to this idea because the reading is not quite accurate on the thread in the archive. Well here is the Accurate version: <BR> <BR>I used 2 Mocchis. One from the market to test LD&#39;s and their affect on fatigue, and I used my other S-Class Mocchis &#40;The D&#41; for the HD part. I took each of them out on the 4th week and rested them. I gave them a ML every week of training but nothing for Fatigue. I&#39;m using the Math posted on this site for the math on LD&#39;s and HD&#39;s. I first started with the market Mocchi to test LD&#39;s and here are the results: <BR> <BR>LD Results: <BR> <BR>F = Fatigue <BR> <BR><B>F = 0 monster is &#34;very well&#34; <BR>F = 1 - 11 monster is &#34;well&#34; <BR>F = 11 - 21 monster &#34;seems well&#34; <BR>F = 21 - 31 monster &#34;seems well&#34; <BR>F = 31 - 41 monster &#34;seems well&#34; <BR>F = 41 - 51 monster &#34;seems tired&#34; <BR>F = 51 - 61 monster &#34;seems tired&#34;</B> &#40;He becomes visibly tired here&#41; <BR><B>F = 61 - 71 monster &#34;seems pretty tired. Give it some rest&#34; <BR>F = 71 - 81 monster &#34;Oh.... Monster seems very tired&#34;</B> <BR>&#40;Here is the critical point in fatigue. he begins to fail and play truant here. You will also be asked to rest your monster instead of drill him. <BR><B>F = 81 - 91 monster &#34;seems pretty tired. Give it some rest&#34;</B> <BR>&#40;Notice that for some reason it went back to this message. I don&#39;t know if Failure alters this.&#41; <BR><B>F = 91 - 101&#43; monster &#34;you are to hard on it... monster will pass out&#34;</B> <BR> <BR>NOTE: On all of these, he had a Success up until the 71 - 81 part. He had a very hard time passing, so I did not reset if he failed or played truant. I did not scold it, and fed him tablets at the end of each month. <BR> <BR>Here are the HD results: <BR> <BR><B>F = 0 monster &#34;Very well&#34; <BR>F = 1 - 16 monster &#34;is well&#34; <BR>F = 16 - 31 monster &#34;Seems well&#34; <BR>F = 31 - 46 monster &#34;Seems tired&#34; <BR>F = 46 - 61 monster &#34;Seems tired&#34;</B>&#40;Became visibly tired here.&#41; <BR><B>F = 61 - 76 monster &#34;Seems pretty tired. Give it some rest&#34;</B> <BR>&#40;Here is the critical point in fatigue. Asks for rest before drill and starts playing truant and fails&#41; <BR><B>F = 76 - 91 monster &#34;Oh... Monster seems very tired&#34; <BR>F = 91 - 106&#43; monster &#34;you are to hard on it... Monster will pass out&#34;</B> <BR> <BR><B>NOTE:</B> My mocchi had 3 stars in every drill and I do not know if that effects any extra fatigue. Also, he had success&#39;s on all the drill up to the 76 - 91 part. I did not scold him for Failing or Truancy nor did I reset it when he had one of them. It was already his critical point and would be hard for him to success. He was fed tablets at the end of each month. <BR> <BR><B>NOTE TO ALL OF THE ABOVE:</B> <BR> <BR>I did not know if feeding messes with the fatigue earned when drilling, and did not know about fails and truancy. I just followed the cycle of fatigue given. I hope that this is a bit more accurate in fatigue. This helps me out when creating a method and helps me under stand about the math. Hope this helps others out as well.
