 I just thought I&#39;d start a thread to post all the little tips for beginners that often get overlooked once more advanced projects get started. My first tip is, don&#39;t be too eager to go into battle! Raise your monster a bit, gain some loyalty and some stats before heading into the Official D Tourney! &#40;You probably won&#39;t beat A class and head into the Hall of Fame with your first monster. Use it, instead, to learn about the game and earn some money.&#41; If you keep your monster at lower levels a bit longer, you can enter several tournaments and build up a cash reserve. &#40;If you barely squeek by and win an official tourney, the unofficial tourneys at the next level will be tough! You&#39;ll be a year or so away from getting more cash in battle.&#41;

 well, i did know this, but only by sheer luck.  even if it seems like you are not succeeding, try everything the moment you get the chance.  that means the shop, the lab, the market, the errantries, the expeditions - everything. the game seems to reward the player who partakes of the most opportunities, even if it seems you are not getting anywhere on the screen.

Save early on, and save often! Save every week during the infancy, if you want the opportunity to reset the game and correct mistakes. You&#39;ll mostly be saving over your old data, but it&#39;s also useful to start new game saves right before or after major events. That way you can re-visit events like Alien encounters, or start branching off your game trying different styles of raising on various saves. It also helps to pick up an extra memory card to use as a backup. Transfer a few key saves, and update your progress on this card once a week or so. That way, if your regular card dies, or a family member erases your 100&#43; year save, you can salvage some part of your progress! <BR> <BR>Another useful tip is: Take Notes! Keep a small notebook handy for writing down your CD list, and keeping track of your monster&#39;s stats and dates of accomplishments. This way, after 50&#43; years of ranching you&#39;ll be able to compare your&#39;s and your monster&#39;s progress! &#40;And if things go wrong, you&#39;ll be better able to describe the problem, and get some help here!&#41; <BR> <BR>Try every CD you can find! Take those free AOL disks at the local computer shop, try that disc that came with the boring magazine! You never know what they might make, I have gotten very rare monsters off of free CDs. I also save them, all of them, just in case they make a good monster in the NEXT Monster Rancher game. &#40;I got my first Mew off a free CD from a couple of years ago, I saved it from my MR1 days.&#41;

 Don&#39;t look at the monsters you see talked about here and freak out about your monster not being as good. A lot of the people here have been Ranching for many, many game-years, and have had a LOT of practice and money to get our monsters up. Don&#39;t worry that you can&#39;t max out a monster&#39;s stats. Instead, worry about getting those stats up to a &#39;fight-beating&#39; level. You&#39;d be surprised at how low that number can be, at times. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t be afraid to do a lot of fighting and a lot of errantry with your first few monsters. It&#39;ll trim their lifespan a lot, true, but at the same time, you&#39;ll make money, get items, and make them good breeders with the extra moves. Remember: a first-gen monster will almost _never_ be as good as even the &#39;weakest&#39; bred monster, because of those extra moves and possible stat-boosts.

 The tournament monsters are all much faster, tougher, more skilled, and powerful than their stats reveal! Be careful! <BR> <BR>And although many of the Official Tournament monsters also appear in the unofficial tournaments, the game makes them more difficult to beat in the official battles!  Some monsters will give up in future battles, including the Official Tournaments and give you the win, if you KO&#39;d them in an unofficial battle. The exceptions are the toughest opponents in the official battles &#40;The boss monster, if you will, who is not always the last monster you fight!&#41; and  Golems. <BR> <BR>Overall, the unofficial battles are very useful. They can earn you more money, rare items, and give you the opportunity to KO certain monsters, who will then never bother you again!

Managing Stress is very important!  <BR>If you get a stress warning, you have already lost lifespan to excess stress! Your goal should be to never get the warning. <BR> <BR>Feed Tablets all the time, no other food is worth the effort. &#40;Unless you&#39;re trying for the Beaclon!&#41; Make sure to rest your monster on the second &#39;seems well&#39;; don&#39;t ever let it become very tired. &#40;Try reading the FAQ post entitled, &#34;List Of Items &amp; Foods and Their Effects by Dark Phoenix&#34; for instructions about stress, fatigue and other factors affected by rest, and feeding.&#41; Try to feed Mint at least twice a month. Nuts Oil reduces fatigue, careful use of it can reduce the number of weeks your monster needs to rest. Be careful, though, rest also helps reduce stress! <BR>Errantries decrease your monster&#39;s lifespan, and increase stress and fatigue. What errantries can do is give you more techniques that can be used in battle. This is useful, and I recommend taking advantage of errantries when the price is reduced to $1,000. I always go to errantry on week 1 of a month. This way, I can feed the moster directly before &amp; after. &#40;Feeding Tabs is really the only way.&#41; Nuts Oil on week one, just before heading to the errantry. I feed Mint on the week one following and make certain the monster rests. <BR> <BR>Too much stress is the most common cause of short lifespans, careful use of items and foods can help you get the most out of your monster. <BR> <BR>If a monster asks for an item, look up its effects, it may be worthwhile to feed the item, to help balance your method.

 As far as keeping stress down, I found battling to be a much better way than Mint Leaves for early in one&#39;s career- after all, it&#39;s making money versus losing money, and while you may not like what it does to your monster&#39;s lifespan, that&#39;s not your primary concern as a beginner.  In fact, it&#39;s best in this case- it lets you unlock techs, so that your next-gen monsters can start off with lots of moves.

 i wish i had known how to change moves during battle.... i played the game about ten years before i found that out. so, BTW, i think u use the R1 &amp; R2 button to select range, and the square &#40;?&#41; button to select the move

 Also, in the early going, even if not necessarily on your first monster or two, when going to  <BR>go after the huge cash reserve, try to do it with a B-Class monster.  B-class is where the  <BR>money is.  Even if it doesn&#39;t have the highest prizes, all of the winnings are respectable, you  <BR>get a couple things &#40;Pure Gold &amp; Silver, for example&#41; that are worth serious bank, and there&#39;s  <BR>FAR more battles in B-class than in any higher &#40;and if I&#39;m right, than in ANY rank&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Also, don&#39;t think that just because a monster on Errantry is E-class and yours is &#34;D&#34; that your  <BR>monster can take it.  Errantry monsters are pretty much always tougher than tournament  <BR>monsters of the same class.  And don&#39;t get cocky in early battles.  E-class is one of the  <BR>toughest levels, because monsters haven&#39;t had the time to expand their number advantages.   <BR>Therefore, even if you have double the speed and skill of Harikicks, remember that you&#39;re  <BR>only about 100 points up on him.  And don&#39;t get into fights your monster can&#39;t win.  If the  <BR>monster&#39;s getting his butt handed to him, train for awhile longer before sending him back. <BR> <BR>And always remember that all the monsters are different.  Some age faster, some are power  <BR>monsters, some are smart, some are fast, some are tough.  Find out what your monster is  <BR>good at and focus on that.  I remember trying to make my first 4 or 5 monsters all well  <BR>rounded... quite a feat if you&#39;re trying to build the POW, LIF, &amp; DEF  of a Kato and a Bowwow,  <BR>who all have natural SPD, INT, SKI dispositions. <BR> <BR>Most importantly, have fun.  It&#39;s a game.  Enjoy it! <BR> <BR>PezCat <BR> <BR>=^..^=   =

 and the final reason to stay in b class, pezcat, is that A level tourneys are also accessible when in b class.

 One of the things I did not understand fully when first starting out is that some techs had to be unlocked.  Like some of them you had to use a certain move for fifty times, and others still required that, AND being good/bad natured.

 Mangos give my monsters an extra day of drills, so that I can get them back on schedule. They also prevent monsters from getting too thin from all the mints that I give them. And, at times increases loyolty.

 Mangos are pretty useful for ranchers on a tight budget &#40;I like to call them the Poor Man&#39;s Nuts Oil&#41;, but as you advance &#40;and get richer&#41; you&#39;ll find yourself using more expensive and potent items later.

 This may sound obvious, but don&#39;t let your monsters just die unless there&#39;s a good reason to do so.  One of the reasons you hear &#34;save, save, save&#34; preached constantly is that death comes suddenly in MR2; from the moment your monster is born, the clock is ticking, and when time&#39;s up it&#39;s all over.  Keep an eye on your monster&#39;s age, and when it&#39;s near death, freeze it!  Keep it on ice, and when you get a second near-death monster, combine the two.  The high stats and extra battle techniques of the parents will often result in exceptional offspring.  It&#39;s not uncommon for Master Trainers to train two specific types of monster to the brink of death for the sole purpose of combining them into a powerful specimen of a particular, desired sub-breed. <BR> <BR>The exception to this, of course, is that some types of monster - the Mock, the Wracky, the Ghost - can only be unlocked by having a monster die on the Ranch.  The easiest way to do this is to summon a Sueki Suezo from the MR1 disk &#40;if you have it!&#41;.  If you don&#39;t, try to sacrifice one of your weaker &#34;money-maker&#34; or &#34;explorer&#34; monsters.  Don&#39;t let a Hall of Fame-caliber monster go gentle into that good night!  Not when you could make a killer crossbreed out of it...

 just because you become good at raising one type of monsters doesn&#39;t mean you know how to raise them all. different monsters require different training. a great example is a pixie trainer trying to switch over to golem training. this also means that while you can be a master at raising one type of monster you are still a novice in raising another
