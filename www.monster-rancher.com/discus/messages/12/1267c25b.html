 Well, Over the weekend I bit the bullet and raised a Hopper.  I admit it, I raised it for 2 reasons:   <BR>1&#41;  I have decided that I will try every primary monster breed at least once, and 2&#41; I wanted the  <BR>Undine Slate.  I was not looking forward to raising this little guy <BR> <BR>However, Lemming, &#40;a Springer... Hopper/Metalner&#41; surprised the hell out of me.  The little  <BR>runt made S-Class and went undefeated &#40;53-0, 31 KO&#39;s&#41;.  Through some miracle he K.O.&#39;d his  <BR>way through B-Class, and with the exception of Arculon, did the same in A-Class.  His speed  <BR>didn&#39;t go up like I would have liked &#40;only made like 650&#43; with it&#41;, but his power was decent  <BR>for a Hopper &#40;450&#43;&#41;, and his skill did max out.  Not bad for a first-genner off a CD. <BR> <BR>This does redeem the little runt in my eyes, as I dreaded actually trying to raise one for much  <BR>of his life.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll keep the Hopper line going on my game &#40;I got every move except  <BR>Flick Combo, I think, if that&#39;s the right move&#41;, but he was very worthy... Thank God for 3 Jump  <BR>Blows! <BR> <BR>PezCat <BR> <BR>=^..^=   =^..^=   =^..^= <BR>=^..^=   =^..^=   =^..^= <BR>=^..^=   =^..^=

 Raise a Hopper/Mock, early in the game, and it wouldn&#39;t die... it lived for 6 years!! and i did everything to kill it, after i got the hot springs, he was about 3 years old, and after that he stats went up only 3 or 4 on a good stat, but he wouldn&#39;t die. i made him stresed and skinny, he got sick, injured and run away but he still wouldn&#39;t die!! it turns that he was the longest living monster i&#39;ve ever had

 To get Flick Combo your Hopper has to be evil and have used Rapid Flick 50&#43; times.  Congratulations on raising a steller Hopper!  By the way, the reason its speed wasn&#39;t as good as other Hoppers was because Metalners are horrible at that stat.  But I bet Defense went up pretty well on him. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m glad to see someone else knows what a lemur is.  I called my champion Snow Hopper Lemuri, and no one seemed to know where I got that name...
