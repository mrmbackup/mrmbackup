<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
Recently I did some test using a Gameshark and a memory editor in order to understand the dynamics of MR2. During this search, I discovered the memory location governing lifespan and I decided to check various breeds of monsters to see how long they may live. LIFESPAN: I found that the potential lifespan of each monster is determined by a preset value which varies depending on type and sub-type. Depending on events and the trainer&#39;s actions, this value may go up or down &#40;mostly&#41;. If not affected by excess stress, fatigue, injury or items, this value wiil decrease at a rate of one per week. In essence, it&#39;s your monster&#39;s biological clock. When that clock hits zero it is...you guessed it... shooting star time. What I&#39;m presenting are the maximum potential lifespan of all 38 purebreed monsters. Note that these values do NOT take into account life altering items such a Magic Bananas, Peaches, Disk Chips, and Drugs. The lifespan of the crossbreds can be determined by averaging the values of the main and sub breeds and rounding up to the nearest ten. The lifespans will be expressed in weeks. Note that this shows POTENTIAL lifespan, not how long the monster will live. Long natural lifespans are no substitute for good raising. I hope you will find this useful. <BR>Pixie - 400 <BR>Dragon - 350 <BR>Centaur - 400 <BR>ColorPandora - 500 <BR>Beaclon - 400 <BR>Henger - 400 <BR>Wracky - 600 <BR>Golem - 450 <BR>Zuum - 450 <BR>Durahan - 500 <BR>Arrowhead - 500 <BR>Tiger - 400 <BR>Hopper - 400 <BR>Hare - 400 <BR>Baku - 500 <BR>Gali - 350 <BR>Kato - 550 <BR>Zilla - 450 <BR>Bajarl - 450 <BR>Mew - 500 <BR>Phoenix - 450 <BR>Ghost - 400 <BR>Metalner - 450 <BR>Suezo - 450 <BR>Jill - 450 <BR>Mocchi - 450 <BR>Joker - 350 <BR>Gaboo - 450 <BR>Jell - 450 <BR>Undine - 400 <BR>Niton - 450 <BR>Mock - 550 <BR>Ducken - 400 <BR>Plant - 550 <BR>Monol - 350 <BR>Ape - 500 <BR>Worm - 400 <BR>Naga - 350 <BR> <BR>A game year is 48 weeks. <BR> <BR>Good luck and may your monsters live long!  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 26, 2000  <BR> <BR>Answers <BR>Good job DP but can you please tell me the cost of the events like how much do the peaches add and how about drugs what do they do.  <BR> <BR>-- Rion Beyolve &#40;<A HREF="mailto:twopaclives@hotmail.com">twopaclives@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, March 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I shall deliver:&#41; <BR>Gold Peach &#43;50 weeks <BR>Silver Peach &#43;25 weeks <BR>Magic Banana &#43;1 or -1 week  <BR>Larox -4 weeks <BR>Manseitan -5 weeks <BR>Troron -6 weeks <BR>Paradoxine -18 weeks <BR>Nageel, Kasseitan, and Teromeann -20 weeks <BR>Battles -3 weeks <BR>Errantry -6 weeks <BR> <BR>Is that helpful?  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>thanks DF!! that was realy good!  <BR>it looks like &#40;since undines and pixies usually live about six years, and they are both 400, that the average lifespan is about 6-7years... not 4 years...  <BR> <BR>im thinkin 450 would mean about 7 years, and 500 would be 7-8 years...what do yall think? i know it would be ALOT more for the master trainers, and alot less for the beginers, but...  <BR> <BR>-- trey &#40;<A HREF="mailto:treymjb@aol.com">treymjb@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Trey: Practically the only way the get the monster to live it&#39;s maximum lifespan is to rest practically it&#39;s whole life. Battles and errantries can bring the numbers above down by quite a bit and as Mikey points out, some monsters are more fragile than others and are more prone to lose lifespan due to stress and fatigue.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR> <BR>Yes it&#39;s diffcult, but not impossible. Remember that battles and errantries decrease a monster lifespan by a significant amount. Basically the only way to get a Pixies to live over six years without peaches is to rest them their whole life.

We don&#39;t get many of those around here anymore. Even though I&#39;m not playing the game anymore, It&#39;s good to know that we still have some experts testing this stuff out. Thanks, Dark Phoenix. Hey, I guess there&#39;s no need for the Bazoula Collaboration anymore, huh?  <BR>Rion, look at &#34;Is generation a factor for lifespan?&#34; from the &#34;raising/training&#34; category and you&#39;ll have a sound theory that should explain why your later gens live longer.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, March 28, 2000.

 Here&#39;s a question that I don&#39;t think had been posted on here yet. If you have a monster with a sub-breed, for instance, I am getting ready to raise a Siren &#40;Undine/Joker&#41; to get it&#39;s potential lifespan, would you add the 2 main species lifespan together to get the potential lifespan? Undine is at 400 weeks, and Joker is at 350 weeks. Would it be safe to say that its potential lifespan would be 375 weeks?

 This info is thanks to Nevistar who pointed this out.  As you can see on my chart, the lifespans of purebreeds are set out in increments of 50.  In order to get the potential lifespan of a subbreeds take your sub breed and add 20 weeks for every step of lifespan above the main breed or subtract 20 weeks for every step below the main breed if the sub breed is shorter lived.  For example, your Undine/Joker: <BR> <BR>Undine = 400 weeks <BR>Joker = 350 weeks <BR> <BR>Since the Joker lifespan is one step shorter than undines the lifespan is calculated as 400 weeks -20 weeks.  So we get this: <BR> <BR>Siren &#40;Undine/Joker&#41; = 380 weeks <BR> <BR>Here is another example going the opposite direction: <BR> <BR>Golem = 450 weeks <BR>Wracky = 600 weeks <BR> <BR>Lifespan = 450 &#43; &#40;20 &#42; 3 steps&#41; <BR> <BR>Mariomax:  510 weeks <BR> <BR>I HOPE that made sense :&#41;

 NOTE:  The lifespans of monsters taken straight off CD&#39;s may vary as much as plus or minus 30 weeks or so, but combined monsters and monsters from the market ALWAYS go by the lifespans mentioned above.
