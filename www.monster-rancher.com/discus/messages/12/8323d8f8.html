 While I was usine the Energizer Bunny Method 4, I stopped and figured out a way to escape a lifespan hit and let it work on monsters that are neutreal to tablets.  <BR> <BR>The method works best at prime for that the monsters stats reach their peak. Also, this method starts at week 4 and is a 2-month cycle. <BR> <BR>Week 4: Candy    =0,0               HD- 20,10 <BR> <BR>Tablet: 20,0 <BR> <BR>Week 1: nuts oil =0,0               HD- 20,10 <BR> <BR>Week 2: mint leaf=20,5              LD- 30,10 <BR> <BR>Week 3: nuts oil =2,10              HD- 22,20 <BR> <BR>Week 4: mint leaf=22,10             LD- 32,15 <BR> <BR>Tablet: 32,2 <BR> <BR>Week 1: nuts oil =5,2               HD- 25,12 <BR> <BR>Week 2: candy    =25,12             RT- 0,2-7 <BR> <BR>Week 3: mint leaf=0,1-4             RT- 0,0 <BR> <BR>Repeat. <BR> <BR>This method takes off 1 hard drill for a rest but it should be worth it because you wont have any lifespan hits and about the same number of hard drills. <BR> <BR>If I made a mistake somewhere, please post them.

 In month 2, week 3, you can exchange the mint leaf for any item since the last rest will autimatically lower your stress to 0.

 A couple things I see wrong with this. First, your not using the HD, LD math correctly.  <BR> <BR>HD = &#43;15 Fatigue, &#43;12 Stress <BR>LD = &#43;10 Fatigue, &#43;5 Stress <BR> <BR>Second your not using the lifeloss/lifespan thing correct. In order to figure out if you lost life or stress, etc. Use: <BR> <BR>Fatigue &#43; &#40;Stress x 2&#41; = Whatever the number. <BR> <BR>Use this to figure out the lost life &#40;if there is&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Other than this, Good method man.

 Week 4: mint leaf=0,0 HD- 15,12  <BR> <BR>Tablet: 15,0  <BR> <BR>Week 1: nuts oil =0,0 HD- 15,12  <BR> <BR>Week 2: mint leaf=15,6 LD- 25,11  <BR> <BR>Week 3: nuts oil =0,11 HD- 15,23  <BR> <BR>Week 4: mint leaf=15,12 LD- 25,17  <BR> <BR>Tablet: 25,4  <BR> <BR>Week 1: nuts oil =0,4 HD- 15,16  <BR> <BR>Week 2: candy =15,16 RT- 0,6-11  <BR> <BR>Week 3: mint leaf=0,3-5 RT- 0,0  <BR> <BR>Repeat. <BR> <BR>I just changed the item used in week 1, month 1. It should be mint leaf so that the monster will have comletely no stress,hopefull, and will redo the course over.  <BR> <BR>For The lifespan index, here it goes: <BR> <BR>Week 4: 0 <BR> <BR>Week 1: 39 <BR> <BR>Week 2: 45 <BR> <BR>Week 3: 61 &#40;oh-oh. Don&#39;t scold your monster if it fails!!!&#41; <BR>Week 4: 59 <BR> <BR>Week 1: 47 <BR> <BR>Week 2: 1-22 <BR> <BR>week 3: 0 <BR> <BR>Then Repeat the Lifespan index all over.  On the second week 4, dont scold your monster because it might give it more stress than expected. If it scolding doesnt affect the monsters gained fatigue and stress, please note me. <BR> <BR>Now is there any more mistakes?

 Yeah this looks better. You don&#39;t use the Lifespan index in the actual method part but you added it all correct at the bottom. But just to question, you did add 24 stress plus the 15 fatigue right? Thats how you got the 39.  <BR> <BR>Also scolding, I think it adds a bit stress. So since your method works with fails, you should not scold it.

 Okie doke. If no one knows, just reset the game if your monster gets a fail. Make sure that you make that the save date.

 I was thinking. Since some monsters are neutreal to tablet, better plump &#40;for their high defence and life&#41;, and still have an OK speed. I&#39;ll post another method that should raise its form pretty fast.

 This looks like a good method to get fattend up a bit before battle... but personally I hate when my monsters get fat. I usually keep them at Slim for a boost in SPD. But for anyone wanting a little boost in DEF it seems good.

 But what you do is get a monster&#39;s speed high and his defence a little lower so that when the monster is plump, it will even out and if you get hit, you have the defence to back it up.

 Well that works good, but I usually have DEF and SPD Maxxed along with &#40;probably&#41; INT maxxed. Unless I am training a Durahan&#40;or other monster which is not to good in SPD/INT.&#41; where I only train SPD/INT in Prime for one year using the Golden Peach.

 Again, this works best at childhood and can only work with monsters liking tablets.  <BR> <BR>Week 1 &#124; Mango      = 0,0       LD = 10,5  Form = 1     Lifespan Index = 20 <BR> <BR>Week 2 &#124; Mint Leaf  = 10,2      LD = 10,2  Form = -4    Lifespan Index = 34 <BR> <BR>Week 3 &#124; Nuts Oil   = 0,7       LD = 10,12 Form = -4    Lifespan Index = 34 <BR> <BR>Week 4 &#124; Nuts Oil   = 0,12      LD = 10,17 Form = -4    Lifespan Index = 44 <BR> <BR>Tablet &#124; 10,2 <BR> <BR>Beggining of Next Week = 10,2  Form = -1 Lifespan Index = 14 <BR> <BR>Week 1 &#124; Candy      = 10,0      LD = 20,5  Form = 8     Lifespan Index = 30 <BR> <BR>Week 2 &#124; Nuts Oil   = 0,5       LD = 10,10 Form = 8     Lifespan Index = 30 <BR> <BR>Week 3 &#124; Mint Leaf  = 10,5      LD = 20,10 Form = 3     Lifespan Index = 40 <BR> <BR>Week 4 &#124; Nuts Oil   = 0,10      LD = 10,15 Form = 3     Lifespan Index = 20 <BR> <BR>Tablet &#124; 10,0 <BR> <BR>Beggining of Next Week = 10,0  Form = 4  Lifespan Index = 10 <BR> <BR>Repeat... <BR>Notes: Since next week you give your monster a mango, the fatigue of your monster is going to 0.

 Maybe if you could, you should think of a way to make a method for your prime, in which your monster uses the most minimal amount of rest possible for more stat gains.

 I&#39;ll have to make a different topic for the whole method. It would get alot of variations, a three month-cycle for prime that includes two rests, two light drills, and everything else is Hard drills. I got all of this planned out already but I still have to type it out.

 Hey BF I just noticed something about the Tablet part, If Tablets are liked it takes away 15 Stress not Fatigue and if nuetral it takes away 13 Stress. And do you train all this for 1st stage 2nd stage 3rd stage or his hole life? Because that would not be that effactive on his third stage!!

Yeah+this+looks+better%2e+You+don%27t+use+the+Lifespan+index+in+the+actual+method+part+but+you+added+it+all+correct+at+the+bottom%2e+But+just+to+question%2c+you+did+add+24+stress+plus+the+15+fatigue+right%3f+Thats+how+you+got+the+39%2e+%0a%0aAlso+scolding%2c+I+think+it+adds+a+bit+stress%2e+So+since+your+method+works+with+fails%2c+you+should+not+scold+it%2e

I+was+thinking%2e+Since+some+monsters+are+neutreal+to+tablet%2c+better+plump+%28for+their+high+defence+and+life%29%2c+and+still+have+an+OK+speed%2e+I%27ll+post+another+method+that+should+raise+its+form+pretty+fast%2e

This+looks+like+a+good+method+to+get+fattend+up+a+bit+before+battle%2e%2e%2e+but+personally+I+hate+when+my+monsters+get+fat%2e+I+usually+keep+them+at+Slim+for+a+boost+in+SPD%2e+But+for+anyone+wanting+a+little+boost+in+DEF+it+seems+good%2e
<!-/Source: 50899-!>
<!-Source: 50901-!>
But+what+you+do+is+get+a+monster%27s+speed+high+and+his+defence+a+little+lower+so+that+when+the+monster+is+plump%2c+it+will+even+out+and+if+you+get+hit%2c+you+have+the+defence+to+back+it+up%2e
<!-/Source: 50901-!>
