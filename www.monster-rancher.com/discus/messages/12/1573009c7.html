 So I&#39;ve been using DP&#39;s method to raise a Big Blue &#40;Golem/Tiger&#41; and for my dummy monster I&#39;ve been raising a pure Zuum. <BR>For the Zuum I&#39;ve been doing this: <BR>WK1:HD <BR>WK2:LD <BR>WK3:REST <BR>WK4:Big Blue comes out <BR> <BR>The Zuum is 3 yr 10 Mo <BR>His stats are: <BR>Lif - 443 <BR>Pow - 556 <BR>Int - 147 <BR>Ski - 540 <BR>Spd - 215 <BR>Def - 221 <BR> <BR>I have sent him on a few errantrys to gain techs. He has fought a fair few battles to financially support the DP method for Big Blue etc. <BR> <BR>He hit Prime fairly early and is currently an elder now! <BR> <BR>I read that Zuum&#39;s live for 450 weeks &#40;9 yrs&#41; <BR> <BR>So at nearly 4 yrs why is he in Elder? <BR> <BR>Any help?

 The information you need is contained here :Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 2 Archive &#40;PSOne&#41;: FAQ: The Most Important Game Data: Lifespan: Effect of Stress and Fatigue  <BR> <BR>From the limited information you have provided the training regime for your Zuum is <BR> <BR>HD <BR>LD <BR>Rest <BR>&#42;Infinity <BR> <BR>...without food. Your Zuum is never being fed and food &#40;read tablets&#41; is important for reducing stress. I don&#39;t know what other items you are giving it each week. <BR> <BR>The combined stress and fatigure of your monster contributes to the &#34;lifespan index&#34;. When this reaches or exceeds 70 your monster begins to lose extra weeks of life. <BR> <BR>Specifically lifespan index is : fatigue &#43; &#40;2&#42;Stress&#41; <BR> <BR>Light Drill: &#43;10 Fatigue/&#43;5 Stress <BR>Hard Drill: &#43;15 Fatigue/&#43;12 Stress  <BR> <BR>Since lifespan index counts stress twice it&#39;s easier to always double stress. <BR> <BR>Lifespan index = fatigue &#43; stress <BR> <BR>Light Drill: &#43;10 Fatigue/&#43;10 Stress <BR>Hard Drill: &#43;15 Fatigue/&#43;24 Stress  <BR> <BR>Your regime: <BR>LD - &#43;10F/&#43;10S = &#43;20LI = 20LI <BR>HD - &#43;15F/&#43;24S = &#43;39LI = 59LI <BR> <BR>Total so far:25 fatigue and 34 stress.... <BR> <BR>Rest: -33 to -47 Fatigue / -5 to -10 Stress <BR>or <BR>&#40;-43 to -55 Fatigue / -9 to -12 Stress w/Fire Stone or Lump of Ice&#41; <BR>Lets assume the best possible outcome every time &#40;which doesn&#39;t happen&#41; <BR> <BR>....Rest - -55F/-12S = 0F/22S = 22LI <BR>LD - &#43;10F/&#43;10S = &#43;20 LI = 42 LI <BR>HD - &#43;15F/&#43;24S = &#43;39 LI = 81 LI !!!! <BR> <BR>As you can see already within 6 weeks the lifepan index of your monster has exceeded 70 and you are now losing an extra week of life per week &#42;at least&#42; <BR> <BR>The following is a list of the critical points of Lifespan loss: <BR> <BR>LI = Lifespan Index &#40;Fatigue &#43; &#40;2&#42;Stress&#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>LI &#62;= 70: -1 week from remaining Lifespan <BR>LI &#62;=105: -2 weeks from remaining Lifespan <BR>LI &#62;=140: -3 weeks from remaining Lifespan <BR>LI &#62;=175: -4 weeks from remaining Lifespan <BR>LI &#62;=210: -5 weeks from remaining Lifespan <BR>LI &#62;=245: -6 weeks from remaining Lifespan <BR>LI &#62;=280: -7 weeks from remaining Lifespan <BR>&#40;Note: your monster will usually run away or go to the hospital if the LI is 250 or more&#41;  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s -1 to -7 of weeks of life PER WEEK in addition to the 1 week of time passed. Your Zuum  is never dangerously fatigued and every time you rest even considering the worst possible outcome &#40;which is -33 fatigure&#41; you are still bringing that down to 0 every time, which is great. <BR> <BR>The most common problem, and it&#39;s the one you have too, is that your stress is rocketing out of control. You need to feed it mint leaves every week to keep the stress down, this will minimize your lost lifespan. Mint leaves cut stress in half every time you use them. <BR> <BR>Even doing this, battles will cost you an extra 2 weeks of life. So every battle is 3 weeks of life lost, game years are 48 weeks so just 16 battles in the entire life of your monster is 1 year removed from lifespan. Errantries do untold damage to your monster, even if it is in perfect condition prior to departure. &#40;If it isn&#39;t the lifespan hits can be insane&#41; <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t use the DP method because it is extremely time consuming and I would prefer to raise monsters quicker and if necessary combine an extra generation or two to achieve the same result.  <BR> <BR>The stats of my Gen1 Bajarl using only light drills apart from swim which was only at the end of his training life:  <BR> <BR>LIFE:872 <BR>POW:999 <BR>INT:1 &#40;lol&#41; <BR>SKI:999 <BR>SPD:999 <BR>DEF:677 <BR> <BR>He has just retired from training and has now entered the freeze-battle stage, so has a while left to live yet. It would have been wiser to train stats to 900 or maybe 950&#43; and use freeze battling to get them higher but I am still learning myself. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t worry, your Zuum is just a money maker. You can combine him and his poor lifespan won&#39;t negatively affect the offspring. <BR> <BR>Your money maker should also be your peach finder/general errantry monster as well as just for battling, so he isn&#39;t going to survive long, but who cares!?! That&#39;s what your dummy monster is for =&#41;

 Wow! Thanks for the information! <BR>That really helps me understand.  <BR> <BR>You say you don&#39;t use the DP method because of the time consumption. So can you recommend a quicker method for me? Preferably one that will guarantee ALMOST max stats if not more.

 I just used the simplest training method possible. <BR> <BR>Light drill - Nuts oil <BR>Light drill - Mint leaf <BR>Light drill - Nuts oil <BR>Light drill - Mint leaf <BR>----Tablet----  <BR>&#42;Repeat <BR> <BR>Using this method there is no need for rest. Regimes involving hard drills sometimes need rest and alternating monthly patterns which is too complicated for my liking. I believe it is possible though to do 3 light and 1 hard or maybe even 2 light and 2 hard drills using the same monthly pattern without rest, but I don&#39;t have this information off the top of my head.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s plenty on the site about training methods that can help you to work this out, but using this simplest of methods with proper combining I&#39;m sure a max stat monster would be achievable in just a few generations. I suggest in real time you could create a stronger monster using this method faster than with the DP method, even though it would require an extra generation or two in game. <BR> <BR>I won&#39;t go into detail about using the magic banana and freeze battling as you should already be familiar with this from the DP method. <BR> <BR>The important factors are keeping lifespan index below 70 for as many weeks as possible &#40;only errantries should cause lifespan hits, your monster should never go on an expedition, that&#39;s what the dummy is for&#41; whilst maximising stat gains. <BR> <BR>I started a new game and shrined a Melon Suezo week 1 of the game. He was supposed to be my dummy monster but he beat the entire game using his basic tech, spit &#40;no errantries or expeditions&#41; and my date of completion was somewhere in 1004, clearly training an uber monster isn&#39;t necessary to beat the game. <BR> <BR>So, why do you want a max stat monster? Do you want it for show, or to battle with friends or perhaps online? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll be posting in the Coliseum soon to try and arrange a tournament...

 Thanks again. <BR> <BR>The main reason for maxing a monster would be to be able to defeat strong enemies such as Bighand with ease - I need to defeat him to unlock Jill.

 Take any monster from the market or a disc and use the training regime I mentioned there and feed it peaches etc and you will have a monster than can steamroll Bighands with ease, no combining required =P

 Okay thanks, I&#39;m currently raising a Zuum/Hare using your method. Looking much better so far, seems to be aging a lot slower than my pure Zuum did.

 I have raised most of my monsters using the alternate method mentioned above: <BR>Nuts Oil: HD <BR>Mint Leaf: LD <BR>Nuts Oil: HD <BR>Mint Leaf: LD <BR>Tab <BR>Repeat <BR>If it cuts your monsters life span, it doesn&#39;t seem to be by much. I have clobbered Most or Poritoka with most of my first generation monsters using this method with minimal rest &#40;other than after tourneys and after expeditions obviously&#41;. I nearly maxxed a third gen Plant/Zuum &#40;everything except POW, which I have still managed to push past 500&#41; with this method and he&#39;s still sitting in the freezer waiting for Elder&#39;s Cups destructions when I get a little bored. If done properly, I can usually raise a monster to HoF in roughly 2 1/2 hours of playing time so this seems to be a fairly quick and efficient way of raising for nearly perfect stats without all of the hassle of the freeze-unfreeze process.
