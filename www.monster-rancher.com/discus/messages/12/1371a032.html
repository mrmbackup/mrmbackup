 This is an archive post.  It is not intended to be a “method” or training regime for your monster.  It is simply how I raised my second Mariomax using the best techniques and tricks I know.  Like my first Mariomax, this is a first generation Golem straight off the Bob Dylan’s greatest hits CD.  The goal here is to achieve the highest overall point total. <BR> <BR>Unless otherwise noted, the Monster is assumed to be even in raising style, normal in weight, and Bad in nature.  This monster was raised on a ranch that has all the stable and house upgrades including the hot springs.  Items in inventory throughout the monsters life are: 3xGemini Pot, Artemis Statue, Lump of Ice, Fire Stone, Dino Tail, and Heel Badge.  When the date skips forward a couple of weeks, it is assumed that Bruce was put in the freezer and another monster went to the ranch.  I’ll continue to tack on more posts, time allowing. <BR> <BR>Bruce, Mariomax &#40;Golem/Wracky&#41; 0.0 Years old <BR>Likes Tablets, Dislikes Potato, Even, Normal, Worst <BR> <BR>Lif-92, Pow-150, Int-103, Ski-68, Spd-83, Def-131 <BR> <BR>Nov 4th, Candy, Run &#40;Fail, Scold&#41;, Tablet, Dec 1st, Mint, Shoot &#40;2&#41; <BR>Dec 4th, Nuts Oil, Rest, Tablet, Jan 1st, Paradoxine, Run &#40;3&#41; <BR>Jan 4th, Mint, Study &#40;1, Cheat, Scold, Worst&#41;, Tablet, Feb 1st, Nuts Oil, Study &#40;2&#41; <BR>Feb 4th, Mint, Domino &#40;4&#41;, Tablet,  <BR> <BR>Lif-95, Pow-274, Int-106, Ski-190, Spd-54, Def-88 <BR> <BR>Mar 4th, Mint, Rest, Tablet, Apr 1st, Paradoxine, Run &#40;3&#41; <BR>Apr 4th, Nuts Oil, Study &#40;2&#41;, Tablet, May 1st, Mint, Shoot &#40;3&#41; <BR>May 4th, Nuts Oil, Run &#40;2&#41;, Tablet, <BR> <BR>Lif-100, Pow-394, Int-108, Ski-313, Spd-37, Def-59 <BR> <BR>Jun 4th, Mint, Rest, Tablet, Jul 1st, Paradoxine, Shoot &#40;3&#41; <BR>Jul 4th, Mint, Run &#40;3&#41;, Tablet, Aug 1st, Nuts Oil, Study &#40;2&#41; <BR>Aug 4th, Mint, Run &#40;1, Cheat, Scold, Worst&#41;, Tablet, <BR> <BR>Lif-104, Pow-514, Int-110, Ski-436, Spd-26, Def-41 <BR> <BR>Sep 4th, Mint, Rest, Tablet, Oct 1st, Paradoxine, Study &#40;4&#41; <BR>Oct 4th, Mint, Run &#40;4&#41;, Tablet, Nov 1st, Nuts Oil, Study &#40;3&#41; <BR>Nov 4th, Mint, Run &#40;1, Cheat, Scold, Bad&#41;, Tablet, <BR> <BR>Lif-109, Pow-634, Int-117, Ski-556, Spd-18, Def-28 <BR> <BR>Dec 4th, Candy, Rest, Tablet, Jan 1st, Mango, Endure &#40;11, Great, Praise&#41; <BR>	Jan 2nd, Mint, Dodge &#40;4&#41;,  <BR> <BR>Jan 3rd through Mar 3rd, Errantry monster picks up two more Paradoxines, <BR> <BR>Mar 4th, Mint, Meditate &#40;9,2,-3&#41;, Tablet, April 1st, Nuts Oil, Rest <BR>April 4th, Paradoxine, Run &#40;5&#41;, Tablet,  <BR>May 4th, Mint, Study &#40;4&#41;, Tablet, Jun 1st, Nuts Oil, Run &#40;5&#41; <BR>Jun 4th, Mint, Study &#40;4&#41;, Tablet,  <BR> <BR>Lif-119, Pow-754, Int-134, Ski-678, Spd-16, Def-25 <BR> <BR>One more dose of Paradoxine to go!

 To Anonymous: The 16 SPD on the Mariomax was due to the side effects of Paradoxine.  Just wait until he&#39;s finished.  You&#39;ll be surprised!

 um, jimbo, i bow to your brilliance as a trainer, but as a mathmatician...unless you typo-ed one of the categories, those numbers do not add up to 2509 total...oh wait i see your typo - its 2059 not 2509.

 End of Stage 1, and 2000&#43; already?? Love those drugged out monsters! I used to be against them until I tried DP&#39;s method using Troron, and saw the incredible stat gains! BTW, I remember your first Mariomax post at the old LUSENET site: &#34;Farmer Jimbo Raises A Mariomax&#34; was what it was called, I think.

 That&#39;s right Tony, that was a monster raised with a little help from Toron.  I&#39;m glad I tried that before plunging into a paradoxine monster using elements of DP&#39;s method.  It gave me nice comparability.

 By the way, &#34;Farmer Jimbo Raises a Mariomax&#34; is located in metroplolis&#39; &#34;breeding/combining&#34; category.
