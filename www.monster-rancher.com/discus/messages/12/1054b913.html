<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>RNA</B> on <B>Monday, April 24, 2000 - 03:01 am</B>:</FONT><P>
This is my first attempt to raise a monster using many of the techniques picked up from among others: RNA, Dark Phoenix, Azn-Beast, Lao, and countless others. Basic rules are simple. The monster must be fed an item every week. Each Mango or Nuts Oil must be offset by a Mint Leaf. Monster may not go more than 7 weeks without a rest. Monster must be kept even, bad, and normal &#40;weight&#41;. No drill may be run two weeks in a row &#40;ie study, study&#41;. No hard drills two weeks in a row until Prime is hit &#40;ie leap, pull&#41;. Some minimal reloading for battles and errantries, but not much for just drills. Items in inventory: 3 gemini pots, 3 sculptures, 2 dino tails, lump of ice, fire stone, and Heel Badge. I didn’t use any sort of Dark Phoenix dummy monster trick until Iassic hit his prime, and then only to get a tablet and a rest after the fifth or sixth week of training.  <BR> <BR>Starting Stats for my Mariomax &#40;Golem/Wracky&#41; Iassic, 1st Generation straight of Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits Vol I:  <BR> <BR>Lif 92, Pow 150, Int 103, Ski 68, Spd 80, Def 131, Likes Tablets, Dislikes Battle, Worst Nature  <BR> <BR><B>End of stage 1:</B> 2 years 5 months old Lif 159, Pow 450, Int 202, Ski 228, Spd 162, Def 200, Won the Maple Cup &#40;E&#41; and the IMA &#40;E&#41; tourney. Learned Thwack on the Prepare Jungle errantry. Used 6 torons and fed 8 magic bananas.  <BR> <BR><B>End of stage 2:</B> 5 years old, Lif 350, Pow 629, Int 382, Ski 266, Spd 253, Def 404, Won the Gemini Cup &#40;D&#41;, IMA &#40;D&#41; tourney, and the Crab Cup &#40;C&#41;, Torble Sea errantry twice for slap and charge, Papas Mtn once for brow hit. Two additional torons and 12 magic bananas.  <BR> <BR><B>Gold Peach:</B> 6 years old, Lif 442, Pow 723, Int 500, Ski 419, Spd 332, Def 532, Won the Poanka Cup &#40;B&#41;, the Teleomann Cup &#40;A&#41;, IMA &#40;S&#41; Tourney, Torble Sea errantry for heavy slap. 5 magic bananas.  <BR> <BR><B>Silver Peach:</B> 7 years old, Lif 508, Pow 717, Int 681, Ski 462, Spd 450, Def 709, just drills. 8 magic bananas.  <BR> <BR><B>End of Prime:</B> 8 years 2 months old: Lif 636, Pow 808, Int 784, Ski 504, Spd 566, Def 840, Kawrea errantry twice for roll assault and cyclone. 7 magic bananas.  <BR> <BR><B>Hall of Fame:</B> 9 years 2 months old: Lif 706, Pow 898, Int 801, Ski 563, Spd 618, Def 909. 7 magic bananas. Beat the major four and Most!  <BR> <BR>Iassic still has some life left in him, I’m going through a modified freezing process right now to try and get some stat gains through battling. He doesn’t like battle though so I’m not sure if he’ll make it to age 10. Stat gains have dropped off seriously after the Legend Cup battle: 6’s on Domino and endure, lucky to get 3 on shoot. This is without a doubt though my proudest achievement so far. A 4500&#43; point monster straight off a CD! And by the time I’m finished, I might hit 4800! One more note, Iassic is still 50000g in the hole. Using an item every week sure is costly. I’ll update this post with his final stats in about a week. Thank you to all who contributed to this board and made this raising success possible.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, April 04, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Leave it to Farmer Jimbo to give very detailed and indepth reports. Nice job Farmer Jimbo. Haven&#39;t seen you here for a while and now you come back with a post like this. Good job. Now see if you can raise the same monster using 7 paradoxine and get like way better results. That would be quite impressive. Once again a great post. Nice job.  <BR> <BR>-- The Man &#40;djedmond@@pinenet.com&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>And how could I forget &#34;the Man&#34;! The eight torons I used subtracted 48 weeks from my monster life, this was more than offset by the use of 47 MB&#39;s. Why more? The 48 weeks I lost were mostly during stage 1, the 47 weeks I gained though MB&#39;s were heavily weighted in stage three. Seven paradoxines would certainly get me better overall stats, and I&#39;m itchin to raise another mariomax, but no way would I hear colt say &#34;Lets us make whish and years&#34;,&#34;I&#39;m very happy that you lived this long&#34;. I should be able to fit 7 paradoxines &#40;126 weeks&#41; into stage 1. It would be close though and I don&#39;t think I can fit it many more MB&#39;s unless I go completely to a Dark Phoenix method.  <BR> <BR>As some of you may know, I got a promotion at work that is sucking a lot more time than my old hourly job. I&#39;m still hanging around, and I WILL finish the mocky project some time in the future. Just when that is though, I don&#39;t know. I just got conned into running spotlight for a production of &#34;South Pacific&#34; so my MR2 time is being cut back again. Cest la vie.  <BR> <BR>Thank you for the praise &#34;the Man&#34;  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Nice stats,Farmer Jimbo!! I still think mint leaves positively affect speedster drills&#40;INT,SPD,SKI&#41;,and Nuts oil or candy help Tank drills&#40;LIF,POW,DEF&#41;.Your method of a different drill every week would help me test that further.Nice work on Iassic.  <BR> <BR>-- Argos &#40;<A HREF="mailto:stanrock@uwm.edu">stanrock@uwm.edu</A>&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>A very well balanced monster! Great post. I like the Mariomax too. I gotta train me one!  <BR> <BR>-- Tony &#40;<A HREF="mailto:amcdaniel@riteaid.com">amcdaniel@riteaid.com</A>&#41;, April 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>You like those wracky breeds, don&#39;t you? I guess the only thing that a mariomax lacks in, is SKI. Pretty well rounded in other areas and very high potential lifespan as well. I wouldn&#39;t expect too much stat gains from battles. I always make sure that my monsters either like battling, or don&#39;t mind it. I don&#39;t think it affects stress level, however, it does affect the stat gains you get after battle. Well, good luck anyways.  <BR> <BR>South Pacific? What&#39;s that?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, April 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>ooh! oooh! i can answer that one rna! &#91;steps into phone booth and emerges as ... OLDMAN! &#93;  <BR> <BR>it&#39;s a rogers and hammerstein musical from the late 40s/early 50s containing such great showstopping numbers as &#34;bali hai&#34; &#34;I&#39;m gonna wash that man right outa my hair&#34; and &#34;there&#39;s nothing like a dame&#34;  <BR> <BR>ah! that felt good...is it time for shuffleboard yet?  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, April 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Yes, &#34;Oldman&#34; is right! We in the cast and crew affectionately refer to it as &#34;South Pathetic&#34;. It&#39;s the pinacal of &#34;Blue Hair Theatre&#34;.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, April 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Whoops, obviously no spell check was run on that last one.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, April 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>to RNA: Disliking battle seems to not only reduce gains on battles, it also increases the fatigue and weight loss from battle. Unless my Mariomax is completely rested beforehand, he comes out afterwards &#34;seems tired&#34;. I assume that this has an accompanied increase in stress as well. I would have preferred a monster that at least tolerated battle, but I gave up reshrining my CD when I got a Mariomax that liked tablets. I made a deliberate decision to take what the game gave me a see how it affected the play.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, April 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Congratulations, you have given me hope that a First Gen. monster can be maxxed out &#40;I have wanted to eventually get a few of the /??? sub-breed monsters maxxed out&#41;...great job, if you continue to get such success from your method...you should definately write it up completely and post it  <BR> <BR>-- fred &#40;<A HREF="mailto:baab_thatcher@yahoo.com">baab_thatcher@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, April 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>What, 19 years isn&#39;t old enough? I know my share of old movies and cinematic whatchamacallits. I mean, come on! I&#39;ve been around to catch the first star wars episodes and indiana jones part 1! But I have no idea what south pacific is.... I must&#39;ve missed that one on the FOX network. <BR>  <BR>You and The Man seem to have the same experiences, Farmer Jimbo. Maybe disliking battling really does &#34;hurt&#34; your monster. Argh, still so many unknown facts about the game.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, April 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Unless your a big fan of community theatre, you probably don&#39;t have much chance of seeing South Pacific, or other great blue hair classics like &#34;Oh Glaucoma&#34; or &#34;Mucus Man&#34;. That stuff is, well, it&#39;s not my favorite theatre in the world. The sneaky underhanded producer put my name in the program before I had a chance to say yes or no, so I&#39;m obligated. On the bright side, I get to use brand new equipment in the nicest theatre in Cincinnati, the Aranoff Center.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, April 06, 2000.
