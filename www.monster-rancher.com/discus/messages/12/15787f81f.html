 I posted this on the gamefaqs board, but I hardly got replies.. so I hope I can get more replies here for my particular problem. Here goes. <BR> <BR>Throughout my time playing this game, I&#39;ve had some trouble getting some techs of some specific monsters. I&#39;m a move collector, so this is rather infuriating for me. I know that some techs are already identified as glitched for some monsters, but I believe the techs I&#39;m about to list are either undiscovered glitches themselves, or I just actually suck at getting techs. Anyway, onwards to dem techs.. <BR> <BR>Golem - Giant Chop &#40;sharp tech, but the Papas won&#39;t give it to me&#41; <BR> <BR>Beaclon - Frantic Horn &#40;apparently a chain tech with Horn Cannon being the pre-requesite, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve used Horn Cannon over a bazillion times, and still no Frantic Horn..&#41; <BR> <BR>Centaur - Death Thrust &#40;I&#39;ve heard that only Centaur/Jokers can learn this, but I still get that &#34;It&#39;ll be difficult to learn this technique&#34; message for the Mandy errantry with both my Centaur/Durahan and Centaur/Pixie being evil as much as possible..&#41; <BR> <BR>Wracky - Wracky Combo, Twister Slash &#40;I think the Twister Slash is chained with Spin Slash as the pre-req, still can&#39;t get it though after mass-spamming Spin Slash ;Wracky Combo, I&#39;m stumped&#41; <BR> <BR>Phoenix - Flame Cannon &#40;this one&#39;s known to be an evil tech, the trouble for me is that I simply cannot seem to turn a Phoenix evil&#41; <BR> <BR>I guess the only problem for me overall is that I probably have not experimented enough with nature levels or taken a more accurate track of the number of times I use techs for tech chains. I&#39;m just curious though if anyone has ever had their monsters learn the particular techs I&#39;ve listed above.

I am super-busy today through Saturday, but, I will try going through some of my saves and saves I have from other people. Have you looked at the tourney entrants at <A HREF="http://www.legendcup.com/" TARGET="_blank">Legend Cup</A>? IIRC, Fenrick posted the monster techs along with stats.

 I&#39;ve actually downloaded Fenrick&#39;s saves and manually looked through the monsters. The only one of interest is the Golem/Wracky, and it doesn&#39;t have the Giant Chop tech. He has a phoenix too, but the issue of it learning Flame Cannon doesn&#39;t bug me too much. Just chalkin&#39; it up as a nature problem.

 I haven&#39;t seriously raised any of these types, so, none of my saves will be of use. I&#39;ll see if I have saves that Fenrick didn&#39;t make public. People to ask, would include mepersoner and hengersrock because they ran another set of tourneys. And, I am trying to recall who ran the Tank War...

 Thank you, Lisa. <BR> <BR>Actually, I have another Wracky tech to list: Fire Juggler <BR> <BR>I know it says on the tech list for Wracky that it can only be learned by the Dragon sub, but I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a possibility that other sub-breeds of Wracky can learn it? I raised a Wracky/Joker who still has at least one tech locked for the Kawrea expedition. I&#39;m wondering if maybe it&#39;s actually two techs, with Fire Juggler being locked along with Wracky Combo. It&#39;s at the end of it&#39;s life, so I can&#39;t really use Flame a few more times to see if it possibly unlocks Fire Juggler. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently raising a Wracky/Pixie to test this. Thanks again for all the help in advance.

 Another Wracky-related post. I just got my Wracky/Pixie to learn Twister Slash. It seems that you need to have a Wracky at a best nature as well as use Spin Slash 50 times. I failed to have my Wracky/Joker learn the tech because it&#39;s nature could only go up as high as &#39;Good&#39;. Mystery solved on one tech, I suppose..
