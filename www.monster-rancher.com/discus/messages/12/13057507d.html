 I&#39;ve been doing some testing of newborn monsters where I can, trying to find out about their combat specials. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been able to find so far. Remember: this is the combat special that the monster is getting right off disk or baseline breeding &#40;AKA two unraised monsters being combined into a single monster&#41;. If you see something that&#39;s in error here, or have something to add, feel free to tack it on. <BR>This chart doesn&#39;t include Anger/Power, since those are completely dependent on whether your monster is Evil/Good natured. Any monster can get them.  <BR>Where I have &#39;unknown&#39; written, this is because I couldn&#39;t get a monster to test it with. If someone can get one and give it a try for me, that would be greatly appreciated! <BR> <BR>APE: None <BR>ARROWHEAD: Guard <BR>BAJARL: Vigor <BR>BAKU: Unknown <BR>BEACLON: Unknown <BR>CENTAUR: Will, Grit <BR>COLORPANDORA: Unity <BR>DRAGON: Rage <BR>DUCKEN: Hurry <BR>DURAHAN: Will <BR>GABOO: Fight <BR>GALI: None <BR>GHOST: None <BR>GOLEM: Guard <BR>HARE: Grit <BR>HENGER: None <BR>HOPPER: Unknown <BR>JELL: None <BR>JILL: Vigor <BR>JOKER: Real <BR>KATO: None <BR>METALNER: Unknown <BR>MEW: Hurry <BR>MOCCHI: Grit <BR>MOCK: None <BR>MONOL: Guard <BR>NAGA: None <BR>NITON: Unknown <BR>PHOENIX: Unknown <BR>PIXIE: Ease <BR>PLANT: None <BR>SUEZO: Ease <BR>TIGER: Hurry, Will <BR>UNDINE: None <BR>WORM: None <BR>WRACKY: None <BR>ZILLA: Grit <BR>ZUUM: None

 Traits aren&#39;t always clear cut, if you have some time I could think of a few tests you might try running...

 By all means. I don&#39;t have a lot of the CDs I used to have &#40;which is why I can&#39;t get a lot of the creatures I used to be able to&#41; so I might not be able to get the monsters immediately. The ones I can get I mostly got off old saves &#40;all hail Dexdrives!&#41;.  <BR> <BR>All of these I got either through combining down to the baseline stats of a purebreed monster, off a monster I got from CD, or off checking one of the baseline monsters I already had on various savestates &#40;apparently from when I&#39;d done baseline testing&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not unwilling to do tests. It&#39;s a matter of what monsters I can get &#40;mostly through Playstation games as opposed to music CDs&#41;.

 Ttry getting a few purebreed tigers and see if they all have those two traits, then test with subs... IIRC traits aren&#39;t definitely always a given for a breed &#40;like I swear I&#39;ve had hares without grit&#41;.

 Fortunately, I found the save again that had all those monsters available. Here we go. First off, I combined Tiger&#43;Tiger five times to get down to baseline stats and battle specials. I&#39;m not mentioning &#39;Power&#39;, of course. The results are as follows: <BR> <BR>Tiger: Will, Hurry <BR>Tiger: Will, Hurry <BR>Tiger: Will, Hurry <BR>Tiger: Will, Hurry <BR>Tiger: Will, Hurry <BR> <BR>So unless something really, really odd is going to happen in the next set of combinations, apparently Hurry and Will are the base Tiger combat stat. If there&#39;s more off a CD, I can&#39;t test; I don&#39;t have any Tiger CDs that I&#39;ve found. This one was created long ago through combining Skipper with Skipper, as I remember.  <BR> <BR>Now, I took that baseline Tiger and combined it with other &#39;baseline&#39; monsters from the same save. I&#39;ve got a Jell, a Naga, a Pixie, a Hare, and a Plant. I also got a Zuum from the market to add in with the combinations. I can probably make others too, but that bunch should at least be a good start to give a look if anything&#39;s going to come out of the baselines. <BR> <BR>Jagd Hound &#40;Tiger/Worm&#41;: Will, Hurry <BR>Datonaire &#40;Tiger/Zuum&#41;: Will, Hurry <BR>Daton &#40;Tiger/Pixie&#41;: Will, Hurry <BR>Hare Hound &#40;Tiger/Hare&#41;: Will, Hurry <BR>Tropical Dog &#40;Tiger/Plant&#41;: Will, Hurry <BR>Cabalos &#40;Tiger/Naga&#41;: Will, Hurry <BR>Jelly Hound &#40;Tiger/Jell&#41;: Will, Hurry <BR> <BR>And I would like to off-handedly comment that getting that Daton was amazingly difficult; the Mint showed up multiple times, and the percentage chance was skewed way in the favor of pixies. Annoying! <BR> <BR>Anyhow, there&#39;s the baseline monsters that I have available to me.  <BR> <BR>As a bonus, I have a few high-level monsters on the same card. I checked out their combat specials out of curiosity. And look here: <BR> <BR>Blue Hare &#40;Hare/Tiger&#41;: Grit, Will, Hurry <BR> <BR>I know for a fact that all hares get is Grit, and that Will and Hurry are Tiger abilities. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t remember what I crossed to create this monster. It&#39;s not a first gen, though. <BR> <BR>However, simple combinations aren&#39;t good enough to get them. Not even &#39;Great&#39; combinations. Because here&#39;s two other monsters on the same save:  <BR> <BR>Battle Rocks &#40;Golem/Durahan&#41;: Guard <BR>Ice Candy &#40;Monol/Jell&#41;: Guard <BR> <BR>On the other hand, here&#39;s one that _really_ surprised me, another product of a &#39;great&#39; combo: <BR> <BR>Janne &#40;Pixie/Durahan&#41;: Grit, Ease <BR> <BR>Why does this surprise me? Because neither Durahans nor Pixies naturally get Grit. At least the Blue Hare made some sense. <BR> <BR> <BR>I tried one combination just to see what would happen, crossing that Hare with the Monol. Here&#39;s a pair of results for it:  <BR>  <BR>Jelly Hare &#40;Hare/Jell&#41;: Grit, Hurry <BR>Jelly Hare &#40;Hare/Jell&#41;: Grit <BR> <BR>So combat specials _do_ apparently randomly cross with combinations, probably with better combinations.  <BR> <BR>Still, where did my Janne get Grit? It&#39;s possible I slipped a disk chip in, but that&#39;s not really like me for the most part.

 Shucks, see, and I want to say Durahan&#39;s sometimes have grit, but so far it&#39;s looking like things are pretty constant. <BR> <BR>Actually, Loveless has grit, but could have just been given to him I guess...

 It&#39;s possible that Durahans _do_ sometimes have grit. I know I&#39;ve seen them get up during battles. However, it could well be because of that &#39;combining&#39; pattern. The one Durahan that I brought down to baseline had &#39;Will&#39; &#40;although I expected it to have Guard, admittedly, because of the defense; obviously my &#39;level 5 defense&#39; suggestion has been proven wrong&#41;.  <BR> <BR>In addition, monsters in the game definitely have different battle specials. For instance, I know for a fact that in the World Monster&#39;s Cup, I&#39;ve seen all three of the monsters get Grit: Siarra, Drewguard, _and_ Zelandia. However, as has been discussed with Liquel and Gas, the monsters get &#39;special dispensation&#39; for being game-controlled monsters.

 Recently, I took a market Mocchi and Suezo and combined them with the Fire Feather. The resulting Phoenix had Power, Grit, and FURY?! <BR>I have no idea how in the blazes he ended up with Fury, but maybe it&#39;s something interesting to try to duplicate.
