 &#40;Note:  This FAQ is for beating the game, not for player vs. player&#41; <BR> <BR>Hengers are fun to train, and are easily some of the stronger monsters in the game.   <BR> <BR>Stat gains: <BR>L/P/I/Sk/Sp/D <BR>Henger/Henger <BR>2 4 3 4 4 2 <BR>Henger/Zuum <BR>2 4 3 4 4 2 <BR>Henger/Joker <BR>2 4 4 4 3 2 <BR>Henger/Dragon <BR>2 4 4 4 3 2 <BR>Henger/Metalner <BR>2 3 2 4 3 3 <BR>Henger/Monol <BR>2 4 3 3 3 3 <BR>Henger/??? <BR>2 4 4 4 3 2 <BR>Suggested Breeds:   <BR> <BR>Henger/Zuum  <BR>Henger/Joker <BR>I&#39;d also recommend the pure, but it is just a weaker version of the Omega &#40;henger/zuum&#41; <BR> <BR>Hengers can be many different types of monsters.  One hit wonders, Speeders, and even tanks... but I wouldn&#39;t suggest it&#41; <BR> <BR>Hengers should be power based monsters, but you can add in intelligence as well.  A first gen henger &#40;suggested breeds, and henger&#41; can max out in 5 stats, and get plenty of moves, if trained correctly.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d suggest the following method for hengers: <BR>HD/LD/HD/LD <BR>NO/ML/NO/ML <BR> <BR>HD = Hard drill <BR>LD = Light drill <BR>NO = Nuts Oil <BR>ML = Mint leaf <BR> <BR>For a speeder &#40;power based&#41; henger I&#39;d suggest the following stats: <BR> <BR>500/800/Any/800/800/400 <BR>With the following moves:   <BR>Close:  Kick, Punch <BR> <BR>Mid-Close: Laser Cutter, Laser Sword.  &#40;Swords if you want to risk the lifespan for it&#41; <BR> <BR>Mid-Far: Hammer Fall &#40;Sledge Fall if you want to risk the lifespan for it&#41; <BR> <BR>Far: Fist Missile. <BR> <BR>Speeder &#40;Intelligence Based&#41; <BR>First off, if you&#39;re going to make an intelligence based henger, I&#39;d suggest never letting the computer control it. <BR> <BR>Stats: <BR>500/Any/800/800/700/500 <BR> <BR>Suggested attacks: <BR>Close: Punch, Kick <BR>Mid-Close:  None &#40;there are none&#41; <BR>Mid-Far: Arm Cannon, Napalm Shot, Burst Cannon <BR>Far: Sound Wave <BR> <BR>Sound Wave is a great move, I would suggest starting off battles with it. <BR> <BR>For a one hit wonder henger I would suggest only using a power based henger. <BR> <BR>Suggested Stats: <BR> <BR>300/950/Any/950/950/200 <BR> <BR>Suggested Attacks: <BR>Close:  Punch, Kick <BR>Mid-Close: Laser Cutter. <BR>Mid-Far:  Hammer Fall <BR>Far:  Fist Missile, Drill Shot, Drill Shots. <BR> <BR>For a one hit wonder, only Drill Shots is really needed in the far away range.  Your main attack should be laser cutter.   <BR> <BR>Any comments or suggestions?  Any ideas on things that should be added?  Taken away?

 Hengers are awesome!  but how might you go about making a tank out of a henger?  guess going with the golem or monol sub?  I can agree that they are fun to raise, and tend to like tablets and are usually best natured&#40;pure hengers at least&#41; don&#39;t think I can suggest anything except that more people train them, they are easily my favorite monster type by far.  I have yet to get an Omega, and have to say the I like the pure most so far, anyone else out there like to raise hengers? The first henger I had was a one hit wonder, but so far I have found I like the pure most as a speeder, anyway, great post!

 Tanks aren&#39;t really an option for Hengers.  A 2 in life and defence won&#39;t really prepare yourself for high life or high defence; swim bug or not. <BR> <BR>MP, the FAQ is good.  Tells everything it should have about Hengers, right techs for each genre &#40;Seeing how you wouldn&#39;t have an antagonist Henger...Sound Wave is it&#39;s only witherer =P&#41; and good suggestions.  Good job.

 The only suggestion i would make as to go more in depth as to why you choose the things you do, esp. the Techs, instead of just listing them. Other than that, good info

 Alright, fair enough.  Kick and Punch are chosen because they&#39;re the basics and you have to have them.  Plus they do come in tremendous handy.  I don&#39;t suggest getting kick and heavy kick because they cost more guts and have a lower hit % <BR> <BR>For the speeder I suggest Laser Cutter, Laser Sword, and Laser Swords if you can get it.  Truthfully Laser Cutter shold be your main attack in this range because it hits hard, and doesn&#39;t completely drain your guts.  However, if you are going against a slow monster &#40;speed wise and guts wise&#41; then I say feel free to sword him so that he takes damage and is drained, leaving you to not have to worry about dodging so much.  Hammerfall and sledgefall are the only power techs for the 3rd range.  Hammerfall is for 19 and does decent damage.  Sledgefall is for a bit more &#40;25 guts&#41; but does more damage and has a tidbit better chance of hitting.  So it&#39;s up to you.  In the back we have fist missile, this is all you need back here because it&#39;s there to hit, and that&#39;s all you want back there, no use in wasting lifespan. <BR> <BR>Intelligence based Speeder, they have no intelligenc techs in the mid-close range, so try to stay away from being close to your opponent, this is your weakness.  The arm cannon series is nicely balanced.  They are very accurate with decent damage,  I&#39;d suggest avoiding using Burst Cannon unless you really need the extra damage, 35 guts is a lot for a henger.  In the far range we have sound wave, this you should start the battles with and drain your opponent, it&#39;ll give you a slight edge because it costs 25 and drains about 35.  Very useful against slower gutted monsters, might want to stick with some of the harder hitting techs &#40;like Burst Cannon&#41; for speeder monsters.  But, like I said, I&#39;d suggest a power henger, because it&#39;ll be hard to win with an intelligence based one... <BR> <BR>One Hit Wonder <BR>These monsters you want to be able to last until you reach 99 guts, which is why you have max speed.  In the Mid-Close range you have laser cutter, all you need because at 99 guts if you hit with it, it&#39;s going to be pretty close to over, and if it isn&#39;t, the cost isn&#39;t to much to charge up again and use again.  Mid-Far range we have hammer fall, you&#39;ll be using this in those moments where you&#39;re not quite sure if you&#39;re going to win so you&#39;re just trying to get as many decent hits in as you can in the last few seconds.  Fist Missile, Drill Shot, Drill Shots.  Really you will probably only be using Drill Shots, save to 99 and blast them, BUT if you&#39;re caught in a situation with a fast monster and you&#39;re trying to hit you&#39;ll be blasting away with Fist Missile, I almost never use Drill Shot.
