 I&#39;ve got an S-class, 3y3m, best-natured dixie that I chose to train because I wanted to see the fire-breathing technique &#40;which an MR website told me was specific to dainas and dixies&#41;, but she can&#39;t seem to learn it. Is it chained? To gigaflame, maybe? She&#39;s used flame enough to unlock gigaflame &#40;which I don&#39;t plan to get because I don&#39;t want to take the time and effort to make her bad- or worst-natured&#41;. Does she need to pass the S-level official tournament?  Do I need to feed her something different? Make her evil? Get gigaray? Anyone have any ideas?

 Well, according to the Tech/tech chains section of the MR2 section of this webpage, Flame Breath is a Special tech, meaning that you&#39;d have to send her on a Def Erranty to get the technique. Now, whether or not you&#39;ve unlocked all the specials prior to unlocking that one I don&#39;t know; tameshite miru? &#40;Why not give it a try?&#41;

 Ah, I see what you mean, scopedog. Maybe I have to get all the other possible specials before that one becomes available.  Well, she&#39;s already got refreshment and bang, so I&#39;ll use bang enough to unlock big bang and see if that works. Thanks, I&#39;ll try it!

 I think it&#39;s specific to just Dainas, but then again I have been wrong before. &#40;not often but I have been&#41;

 Hmm. Good to know. If I can&#39;t get her to ever learn it, I&#39;ll cross her with my crab dragon and try again. I&#39;ll post the results here, if I remember to. Thanks.

 I thought and heard that only Dianas could get the firebreath crossover tech.

 Yeah, I was trusting the info on the list of pixie techs here on MRMetropolis &#40;Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 2 Archive: Techs/Tech Chains: Complete Lists of Techs : Pixie Techs&#41; which says, at the bottom: <BR> <BR>Name &#42; Fire Breath&#42;&#42;&#42;  <BR>Type &#42; INT  <BR>Guts Cost &#42; 49   <BR>Damage &#42; A/D/D/E   <BR>Tech Type &#42; Special   <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; - Crossover Tech, Only Available for Daina &#40;Pixie/Dragon&#41; &amp; Dixie &#40;Pixie/Zuum&#41;  <BR> <BR>but the more I train my dixie the more sure I am that she&#39;s just never gonna get it. She&#39;s in the HoF now, and recently got gigaray. Fire breath still locked though. Oh well. She was fun to train &#40;green! I&#39;m such a sucker for green monsters. i loved my melon suezo and my scaled golem&#41; and will be excellent breeding stock for a daina. Thanks.

 I believe the reason that the Zuum sub-type was included for that technique is that they both have the &#34;Fire Breath&#34; attack in their chains.  Either that, or soembody just screwed up on information gathering.  Hey, it happens.  Sorry for the misprinting, if it is one. ^_^

 Only the Daina &#40;Pixie/Dragon&#41; can learn the special tech &#34;Fire Breath&#34;.  However, if you combine a Daina that has learned &#34;Fire Breath&#34; with a Zumm, the resulting Dixie will be able to learn &#34;Fire Breath&#34;. <BR> <BR>-Discalimer: sub-specific techs are still somewhat of a mystery, even now.

 a HA!  It has all become clear. Thanks, Farmer Jimbo, for clearing that up. On to a daina, then! I&#39;m just as glad to have the excuse to raise yet another pixie, and it&#39;ll convince me to finally raise that crab dragon I&#39;ve had in the freezer for so long. &#40;But I _have_ to do the shishi first, dammit, that thing is hilarious.&#41; Thanks, everybody, for all your help.

 Can you confirm that, FJ? I was unable to get a Dixie to learn Fire Breath, and I&#39;m not aware that certain combinations of specific parents will &#34;unlock&#34; sub specific attacks. <BR> <BR>Perhaps a certain Hare must be combined with Pixie to get the Lepus&#39;s 1-2 Punch...

 RR, any Lepus can learn &#34;1-2 Punch&#34; giving the prper requirements are made.  the same goes with a Lilim and  &#34;Death Final.&#34;  The matter in question was the fact that both of these monsters had a fire breathing attack.  Daina is relatively simple to unlock the technique with, but it&#39;s not unthinkable that Dixie would get it through combinations.  Weirder things HAVE happened. <BR> <BR>Have you ever had a monster that was &#34;Good&#34; natured, with &#34;Best&#34; natured parents start with a &#34;Bad&#34; natured attack?  Many of us have seen this little bug in the program, yet nobody knows why.  Combining is the one field of study that we have been unable to master.  Still, this is the information of the tech. list, which many had tried to create last year.  As the famous quote goes &#34;100 people can&#39;t be wrong&#34; :P  Of course, there was hardly 100 people that tested the Dixie out, but I feel confident that this is correct. <BR> <BR>I also support this with my knowledge of Hopper.  Hopper&#39;s &#34;Lightning&#34; and &#34;Flame&#34; are difficult to obtain, unless it&#39;s a special sub-type &#40;i.e. Tiger and Pixie&#41;.  Still, I HAVE gotten one or both &#40;can&#39;t tell without my notes&#41; of these techniques through combining.  As FJ said, Cross-Over techniques are mostly still a mystery, but for all of those out there with sub-techs through combining &#40;like myself&#41;, it&#39;s not as far-fetched as it sounds.

 The point I was making is this:  Once a Pixie has learned one of it&#39;s special sub-specific techs, the ability to learn this attack is passed down to the children, as long as it stays a pixie for the main breed. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s been so long since I messed with this though, I may be mistaken.  I don&#39;t beleive I&#39;m mistaken about the Daina being the only Pixie type that learn the Fire Breath tech from scratch.

 What are the requirements for getting 1-2 Punch? I have never been able to get the attack.
