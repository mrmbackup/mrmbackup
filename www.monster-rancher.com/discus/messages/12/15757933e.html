 I have researched and compiled in-depth information regarding the results of Light and Heavy Drills. <BR> <BR>Standard Results: <BR>Light Drill = &#43;10 Fatigue and &#43;5 Stress <BR>Heavy Drill = &#43;15 Fatigue and &#43;12 Stress <BR> <BR>Scenario: Zuum fails a drill. <BR>Prior to scold/no scold = Fatigue and Stress stay the same. <BR>Best - Good Nature and Scold = Fatigue doesn&#39;t change and Stress increases by 2. <BR>Bad - Worst Nature and Scold = Fatigue stays the same and Stress increases by 4. <BR> <BR>&#42;Scolding a monster for failing a drill ALWAYS yields these same results. <BR> <BR>Scenario: Zuum cheats on a drill. <BR>Prior to scold/no scold = Fatigue drops &#40;light= -5 to -9  heavy= -1 to -5&#41; and Stress remains the same. <BR>Best/good-natured and scold = F remains decreased and S increases by  4. <BR>Bad/worst-natured and scold = F remains decreased and S increases by 12. <BR> <BR>Scenario: Zuum does great on a drill. <BR>Prior to praise/no praise= Fatigue drops &#40;-2 to -4&#41; and Stress remains the same. <BR>Best/good-natured and no praise = F remains decreased and S increases by 11. <BR>Bad/worst-natured and no praise = F remains decreased and S increases by 6. <BR> <BR>&#42;Neutral Nature can go either way depending on which way it is leaning &#40;Good or Bad&#41;. <BR>&#42;&#42;During testing there was no noticeable difference in the increase of stress between light and heavy drills. <BR> <BR> <BR>Upon hearing that Style also effects the amount of stress induced when scolding for cheating, I&#39;ve decided to do some more testing. <BR> <BR>I accidentally forgot to change the Zuum&#39;s nature from worst to neutral for the test and I noticed that there is a significant change in the amount of Stress received from previous results. I will research the effects of style on different natured monsters. <BR> <BR>&#40;Stress prior to scolding/not praising is the same as a success in that respective drill. The following tests calculate the increase of stress, not the total stress&#41; <BR> <BR>Scenario: Scolding a best/good-natured Zuum for cheating on a drill. <BR>Doting = &#43;7 Stress <BR>Fond = &#43;5 Stress <BR>Soft = &#43;4 Stress <BR>Even = &#43;4 Stress <BR>Strict = &#43;3 Stress <BR>Harsh = &#43;2 Stress <BR>Spartan = &#43;0 Stress <BR> <BR>Scenario: Scolding worst/bad-natured Zuum for cheating on a drill. <BR>Doting = &#43;22 Stress <BR>Fond = &#43;17 <BR>Soft = &#43;14 <BR>Even = &#43;12 <BR>Strict = &#43;9 <BR>Harsh = &#43;6 <BR>Spartan = &#43;0 <BR> <BR>Scenario: Not praising a best/good-natured Zuum for doing great on a drill. <BR>Doting = &#43;20 <BR>Fond = &#43;14 <BR>Soft = &#43;12 <BR>Even = &#43;11 <BR>Strict = &#43;8 <BR>Harsh = &#43;5 <BR>Spartan = &#43;0 <BR> <BR>Scenario: Not praising a bad/worst-natured Zuum for doing great on a drill. <BR>Doting = &#43;11 <BR>Fond = &#43;8 <BR>Soft = &#43;6 <BR>Even = &#43;6 <BR>Strict = &#43;5 <BR>Harsh = &#43;3 <BR>Spartan = &#43;0 <BR> <BR> <BR>While testing withholding praise on a best-natured monster, I realised that the increase of stress directly correlates to the exact number of Fear and Spoil, not the actual style itself. Rather than go back and redo all of the tests I will conduct separate tests to determine exactly what the formula is for calculating the stress increase. <BR> <BR>Testing Spoil and fear effects on stress. <BR>Variable: Spoil and fear &#40;respectively, increments of 10&#41; <BR> <BR>Scenario: Not praising a worst-natured Zuum for doing great on a drill. <BR>&#40;Spoil&#41; <BR>100 = &#43;11 <BR>90 = &#43;10 <BR>80 = &#43;9 <BR>70 = &#43;9 <BR>60 = &#43;8 <BR>50 = &#43;8 <BR>40 = &#43;7 <BR>30 = &#43;6 <BR>20 = &#43;6 <BR>10 = &#43;6 <BR>0 = &#43;6 <BR>10 = &#43;6 <BR>20 = &#43;5 <BR>30 = &#43;4 <BR>40 = &#43;4 <BR>50 = &#43;3 <BR>60 = &#43;3 <BR>70 = &#43;2 <BR>80 = &#43;1 <BR>90 = &#43;1 <BR>100 = &#43;0 <BR>&#40;Fear&#41; <BR> <BR>Scenario: Not praising a best-natured Zuum for doing great on a drill. <BR>100 = &#43;20 <BR>90 = &#43;18 <BR>80 = &#43;17 <BR>70 = &#43;16 <BR>60 = &#43;15 <BR>50 = &#43;14 <BR>40 = &#43;13 <BR>30 = &#43;12 <BR>20 = &#43;12 <BR>10 = &#43;11 <BR>0 = &#43;11 <BR>10 = &#43;10 <BR>20 = &#43;9 <BR>30 = &#43;8 <BR>40 = &#43;6 <BR>50 = &#43;5 <BR>60 = &#43;4 <BR>70 = &#43;3 <BR>80 = &#43;2 <BR>90 = &#43;0 <BR>100 = &#43;0 <BR> <BR>Scenario: Scolding a worst-natured Zuum for cheating on a drill. <BR>100 = &#43;22 <BR>90 = &#43;21 <BR>80 = &#43;20 <BR>70 = &#43;19 <BR>60 = &#43;18 <BR>50 = &#43;17 <BR>40 = &#43;15 <BR>30 = &#43;14 <BR>20 = &#43;13 <BR>10 = &#43;12 <BR>0 = &#43;12 <BR>10 = &#43;11 <BR>20 = &#43;10 <BR>30 = &#43;9 <BR>40 = &#43;8 <BR>50 = &#43;6 <BR>60 = &#43;5 <BR>70 = &#43;4 <BR>80 = &#43;3 <BR>90 = &#43;2 <BR>100 = &#43;0 <BR> <BR>Scenario: Scolding a best-natured Zuum for cheating on a drill. <BR>100 = &#43;7 <BR>90 = &#43;6 <BR>80 = &#43;6 <BR>70 = &#43;6 <BR>60 = &#43;5 <BR>50 = &#43;5 <BR>40 = &#43;5 <BR>30 = &#43;4 <BR>20 = &#43;4 <BR>10 = &#43;4 <BR>0 = &#43;4 <BR>10 = &#43;4 <BR>20 = &#43;4 <BR>30 = &#43;3 <BR>40 = &#43;3 <BR>50 = &#43;2 <BR>60 = &#43;2 <BR>70 = &#43;2 <BR>80 = &#43;1 <BR>90 = &#43;1 <BR>100 = &#43;0 <BR> <BR>To determine the increase in stress based on spoil and fear, find the difference between fear and spoil. If that number is 0 or in favour of spoil, add 100; if it is in favour of fear, subtract it from 100. Divide that number by 200. Multiply that by the maximum amount of stress possible for that scenario &#40;ALWAYS round up&#41;. The stress increase is accurate within an error of 1. <BR> <BR>&#42;There is an error of 1 because the maximum numbers in the previous results are not accurate, as they were rounded to that number. Further tests would need to be conducted to find the actual maximums. <BR> <BR>For example, a worst-natured monster has 78 fear and 42 spoil and is being scolded for cheating. The difference is 36 in favour of fear. Subtract 36 from 100 &#40;100-36=64&#41;, divide it by 200 &#40;64/200=0.32&#41;, and mulitply it by the maximum amount of stress possible &#40;0.32 x 22 = 7.04&#41;. So, if a worst-natured monster had 78 fear and 42 spoil and was being scolded for cheating, the stress increase would be approximately &#43;8 &#40;rounded up from 7.04&#41;.  <BR> <BR>All of these tests were done with a Zuum. A few tests with a Hare did not show any different results. It is unlikely that these results will be different for different monsters. <BR> <BR> <BR>Conclusion:  <BR> <BR>If your monster cheats or does great on a drill, the fatigue will be decreased and stress will stay the same. Scolding a monster for cheating on a drill or witholding praise when it does great on a drill will increase the amount of stress it receives. That amount varies depending on whether it cheated or did great, nature, fear, and spoil. Spoiled monsters get more stressed when being scolded than monsters that are disciplined. <BR> <BR>I find these results do give good reason to keep track of fear and spoil. Being able to calculate the exact stress penalty your monster receives for scolding/witholding praise on drills could help ranchers decide whether or not it is worth it to scold/withold praise. Then again, it might be easier to raise fear and ignore the stress increase altogether, or just focus on the nature of a monster and the results of the drill when determining what kind of stress increase could occur. <BR> <BR>If there are any questions, don&#39;t be afraid to ask. If there are any errors, please let me know.

 Interesting. Nice to have the numbers for these. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve never been able to get the numbers myself but this seems to go along pretty well with that I&#39;ve seen. The only thing that stands out as odd to me is withholding praise causing so much stress - I almost never praise or scold my Worst natured monsters, and I&#39;ve not seen a significant drop in lifespan compared to monsters who were praised, nor have I gotten stress warnings, even when using methods that cut it close to lifespan hits in their normal routine. So I was under the impression withholding praise was &#43;/-0 Stress &#40;or some small number like 2 or 3&#41;

 Are you certain on the LD great numbers? I&#39;ve always noticed my monsters becoming stressed whenever I&#39;ve been using a method which takes them to LI~65 or so, and it&#39;s listed as  &#43;5 to &#43;9 Fatigue / &#43;5 Stress in Nevistar&#39;s post in Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 2 Archive &#40;PSOne&#41;: FAQ: The Most Important Game Data: Lifespan: Effect of Stress and Fatigue, which is 3 different possible outcomes. Seeing as I&#39;m the only person who hasn&#39;t actually looked at hard numbers for this I guess I&#39;m incorrect, but still, if 2 people looking at the numbers have different values it seems a bit curious.

 Because of how long it takes to get a great on a  <BR>light drill I only tested it 20  <BR>times. It&#39;s not impossible that I missed a couple  <BR>results, so when I have the time  <BR>I&#39;ll take a closer look and post the results.

 You&#39;re on the right track, nobody gets the research 100% on the first set of experiments. -Especially with this game. We really appreciate it!

 Finally set some time aside to test the decrease in fatigue when a monster does great on a drill. <BR> <BR>Objective: Observe the decrease in fatigue from doing great in a drill. <BR>Subject: Newly Born Suezo &#40;0 years, 0 months, 0 weeks&#41; <BR>Variable: Drills <BR>Hypothesis: Decreases of -1 to -5 <BR> <BR>All of these results show the decrease in fatigue. <BR> <BR>Domino: <BR>1&#41; -4 <BR>2&#41; -4 <BR>3&#41; -4 <BR>4&#41; -4 <BR>5&#41; -4 <BR> <BR>Shoot: <BR>1&#41; -4 <BR>2&#41; -3 <BR>3&#41; -1 <BR>4&#41; -4 <BR>5&#41; -1 <BR> <BR>Study: <BR>1&#41; -4 <BR>2&#41; -4 <BR>3&#41; -4 <BR>4&#41; -1 <BR>5&#41; -3 <BR> <BR>Dodge: <BR>1&#41; -4 <BR>2&#41; -4 <BR>3&#41; -4 <BR>4&#41; -4 <BR>5&#41; -4 <BR> <BR>Run: <BR>1&#41; -5 <BR>2&#41; -3 <BR>3&#41; -3 <BR>4&#41; -3 <BR>5&#41; -3 <BR> <BR>Endure: <BR>1&#41; -5 <BR>2&#41; -5 <BR>3&#41; -1 <BR>4&#41; -3 <BR>5&#41; -1 <BR> <BR>Pull: <BR>1&#41; -4 <BR>2&#41; -4 <BR>3&#41; -4 <BR>4&#41; -4 <BR>5&#41; -4 <BR> <BR>Leap: <BR>1&#41; -5 <BR>2&#41; -5 <BR>3&#41; -4 <BR>4&#41; -5 <BR>5&#41; -4 <BR> <BR>Meditate: <BR>1&#41; -4 <BR>2&#41; -4 <BR>3&#41; -4 <BR>4&#41; -3 <BR>5&#41; -3 <BR> <BR>Swim: <BR>1&#41; -5 <BR>2&#41; -4 <BR>3&#41; -4 <BR>4&#41; -4 <BR>5&#41; -3 <BR> <BR>50 greats. There were more, but I had missed my chance to check the fatigue on a few of them. <BR> <BR>Conclusion: The range is -1 to -5. I was too hasty to previously claim that doing great on a drill decreases fatigue by 2 to 4 points. <BR> <BR>There does seem to be some repitition in some drills &#40;Domino , Dodge, and Pull were all -4&#41;. Could this be the reason my previous testing, where I had only tested in Domino with a Zuum, had different results? Or is it mere coincidence that some numbers show up more than others in specific drills? Maybe I should research hacking the drills to modify them to give greats every time before I do any further testing in this area.....
