well, my weekend offline was spent housecleaning and raising a champion naga.  took a purple hare and a striker, which dadge rated as a fine combo, and ended up with a naga with decent, but not great, starting stats, and 6 techs.  took the time for 2 errantries, to get pierce and drill attack, and went to work. <BR>     this naga never got his stats as high as my other champions, but every time i took him to a tourney, with stats i thought were borderline good enough, he <U>dominated</U>.  he ended up with only one loss, to waranmo of all monsters, and lived to 6 yrs 1 mo - colt didnt retire him at 6 yrs despite rapidly declining stat gains - with a gold and silver peach.  He <U>dominated</U> poritoka with the following relatively weak final stats: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>lif</TD><TD>pow</TD><TD>int</TD><TD>ski</TD><TD>spd</TD><TD>def </TD></TR><TR><TD>450</TD><TD>950</TD><TD>100</TD><TD>950</TD><TD>300</TD><TD>650</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>All hail Hyde!

 Some monster tend to get modifiers on skills, sush as Golem with power, Durahan and Monol with defense, Gaboo with speed, and Phoenix with intelligence.  Could Naga possibly share some of these, or maybe even all of them?  If so, that would make their incredibly low lifespan understandable.

 Well, with any offense-oriented monster &#40;like the Naga&#41;, one can expect to either dominate the competition or be wiped out quickly yourself.  With the brutal combos that a Naga can pull off, I&#39;m not surprised that its foes fell quickly to it.

 Great Job! I think there are &#40;just like the hidden likes and dislikes&#41; hidden strengths, and I always thought of the Nagas as extra nasty in tourneys.

 I&#39;ve told you before Torey and I&#39;ll say it again. RAISE A TRIDENT. They are, in my opinion the absolute toughest of all the Naga types.

 I think the best naga is a cyclops.  wonder why?  intelligence.  they have as much intelligence as a durahan about, and that is plenty for me.  even though life steal was much better in MR1, it can take out many monsters in 2, and re-fill ur life.

 However, a naga doesn&#39;t need intelligence as much as it needs power. At least the ones I raise generally don&#39;t. Nagas might have life steal and energy shot&#40;s&#41;, but they&#39;re still much more the power creature. <BR> <BR>Me, I&#39;ll stick with a naga/golem. Stab, anyone? &#42;WHAP&#42;

 I&#39;ve trained two types of nagas, well actually one, I tried training a pure and got fed up and stopped.  I also tried a naga/suezo which with a training method of Hd, ld, ld, rest and no items, no peaches, he ended up like this Life: 369, Power: 825, Intelligence: 560, Skill: 690, speed: 45, Defense: 476, he was 4 years 4 months when I finished training him, he now gets me peaches.  Oh and he&#39;s pretty strong for the extremely crappy technique I used.  Oh wait! I did use items, whenever Colt said he seem stressed out I gave him a mint leaf.   That&#39;s it.

 Anyone else tried a Bazula &#40;Naga/Gali&#41;?  A fave of mine from MR1 that actually came off quite well in the sequel!  It has just about the same POW as Kurasu&#39;s beloved Trident &#40;Naga/Golem&#41;; and gives away some LIF and DEF for boosts to SKI, SPD, and &#40;yes&#41; INT.  You&#39;ll still mostly want to train for power, but suddenly techs like Eye Beam and Poison Breath can actually be useful! <BR> <BR>But I still live for Pierce...  &#42;THWAP&#42;!!!
