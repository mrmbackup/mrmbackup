 This is the tehnique I used when I was poor, helped me get some decent monsters, it&#39;ll make you money so you can move on to a better method. <BR> <BR>This is pretty simple. <BR>HD=Hard drill <BR>LD=Light drill <BR>ML= Mint Leaf <BR>NO= Nuts oil <BR> <BR>This is all it is. <BR>week 1 <BR>HD <BR>week 2 <BR>LD <BR>week 3 <BR>LD <BR>week 4 <BR>ML,Rest.   <BR> <BR>You can feed your monsters Tablet, meat, cup jelly, or fish.  If your monster gets stressed feed mint leaf and rest.  When you&#39;re strong enough for the class you&#39;re in, battle in it in all the unofficial tourneys you can.  When beating that class is easy, move up to the next one.  I suggest trying to keep the battling down until B class.  At B class, battle as  much as you can, they tourneys are worth quite a bit, stay in that class for as long as you want, the monster is for money, not for beating the game.  Try to avoid official unless you&#39;re ready for the next class.  Do this with a couple monsters and you should be able to move on to a better training method.

 And don&#39;t forget: don&#39;t be afraid to send your monster to errantries. After al, it&#39;ll get you moves to make your monster more breedable. Might lower the lifespan, but the better oves for what you breed is a _big_ help.

 Well said, Kurasu.  And, despite all the hack-supported evidence I&#39;ve seen, I&#39;m starting to wonder if errantries steal as much lifespan as we think.  My HoF Lorica &#40;he&#39;s appeared on other threads, sorry&#41; was 1st gen right off a CD; he retired with 14 techniques and sitll lived well over 8 years.  Granted, this was with Peaches, but shouldn&#39;t a monster so devoted to errantry and battle have bought it earlier?

 Well, I had a Durahan with 16 moves, who managed to live to the ripe old age of 7y before I bred him. And he wasn&#39;t completely out of lifespan, yet. I just got tired of raising him, and didn&#39;t want to burn out on Durahans. He, admittedly, did start with 6 moves. Still, that&#39;s a lot of moves to get.  <BR> <BR>And as for proof on the move-breeding thing, the child of that Durahan and my phoenix &#40;6 moves&#41; was a beauty Garuda with average stats, but 10 moves to start. Needless to say, he won&#39;t be needing errantries for _his_ training. Thus, I should be able to save a ton of money, as well as being able to keep that lifespan to the max.

 Good stuff!  My own newly-comboed Garuda, the offspring of the aforementioned Lorica and a 1st-gen Phoenix, also started off with a good selection: eight moves right out of the gate, including Millionstabs, my personal favorite and all-around Ordorf-slayer.  His stats were a bit better than average, though not stellar, but the ready-made arsenal more than makes up for it! <BR> <BR>Of course, being the Technique Hound that I am, I&#39;ll probably use the head-start to try to get him to collect &#42;all&#42; the remaining techs.  So this one may not live much past 7 or so regardless...

 Rob Isaacson,  there are reasons why your Lorica lived so long despite all of the errantries. <BR> <BR>1&#41;  Natually Long Lifespan.  A Lorica is a mix between Durahan and Arrowhead, both of which are naturally long lived breeds. <BR> <BR>2&#41;  The fact it was off a CD.  It turns out that some monsters off CD may have longer POTENTIAL lifespans than normal,  sometimes the extra may be a year or more. <BR> <BR>3&#41;  A phenomenon involving Durahans, Arrowheads, and Hengers  and the crosses  called &#40;by Nevistar&#41; the HAD effect.  Monsters with the HAD effect not only have their fatigue reduced when given Nuts Oil, but also get the added benefit of having some of their stress reduced as well. <BR> <BR>In short, your Lorica lost lifespan, but the breed in question is also particularly resistant to lifespan reducing effects as well, explaining your monster&#39;s long life despite many errantries.

 End of life, I believe it was Puffball, but I&#39;m not sure, I sent him on an errantry, he died when he got back.  Then I did this, NO,Swim,ML,Endure,NO,Endure,ML,Endure,Tablet,NO,Swim,ML,Endure,NO,Endure,ML,Endure,Tablet,NO,Swim,ML,Endure,ML,Endure,Dead.  That&#39;s an extra ten weeks.

 Hey, DP, thanks for the additional info!  I knew about the Nuts Oil &#34;fatigue effect&#34;, but this is the first I&#39;ve heard about point #2!  CD monsters can get as much as a YEAR of potential extra life?  Man, I&#39;ll have to start visiting the Shrine more often!  I think I&#39;ve got a Corkasus CD kicking around somewhere, too...  8^&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks much!

 I would, but only to use as a money-making monster. The stats are going to be good, but probably not good enough for HoF status &#40;of course, I have been wrong before&#41;. Go for two monsters raised like this, breed them, and use the offspring for the HoF&#39;er. At least, that&#39;s what I did. Your milage may vary, obviously. ;&#41;

 I had two HoF&#39;er monsters from this, both hengers, couldn&#39;t get anything else nearly as strong with the method for some reason, probably because I know my hengers.

 I&#39;m trying this with an Angel&#40;I love Angels!&#41; that I slated from MR1, and she seems to be working out of her &#34;problem months&#34; quite well using this method. Thanks for the input, Kurasu and mepersoner.!!!!

 Hmmmm... at a glance. <BR> <BR>HD <BR>15/12 &#40;39&#41; <BR>LD  <BR>25/17 &#40;67&#41; <BR>LD  <BR>35/22 &#40;79&#41; Lifespan Loss! <BR>ML/Rest  <BR>Item. <BR> <BR>Hmmm... this will work better <BR>HD LD LD Rest <BR>-  ML -  - <BR>So that&#39;s  <BR>15/12  then ML knocks it down to 15/6 then 25/11 then 35/16 which is 67, cutting it really close. <BR>Rest, knocks everything down to to at least 2/11 then Tablet, 2/0.  So a slight increas in fatigue over time, but probably not because that&#39;s the mininum value.  Other items will have a slight increase in stress as well, but it should start looping eventually. <BR> <BR>So here&#39;s how you should be doing the method. <BR>1  2  3  4 <BR>HD LD LD Rest <BR>-  ML -  - <BR> <BR>There that&#39;s better.   <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll see if I can make an even better method for poor trainers later.
