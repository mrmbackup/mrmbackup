 First of all, this FAQ is basically a recap of the many bits of information scattered around the site. I have literally cut and pasted much of it, and i will give thanks to the authors from whom i have copied. The purpose of this FAQ is to get all the information on Ghosts in one easy to access place.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Intro: Ghosts are great little creatures, and are very similar to pixies, except that they don&#39;t have nearly as many moves, which isn&#39;t that bad, since the ones they have seem to be enough. Their stat orders are: <BR> <BR>ghost/ghost 1 1 4 4 4 1  <BR>lifespan: 400 weeks &#40;Thanks to MePersoner for this info&#41; <BR> <BR>Their baseline stats are: <BR>Ghost/Ghost 100 90 120 140 150 80  <BR> <BR>As you can see, they are strongest in Intelligence, Skill, and Speed. When rasing, I recomend either of MePersoner&#39;s methods &#40;&#91;Tablet/HD/NO, LD/ML, HD/NO, LD/ML&#93; for trainers with money, or  <BR>&#91;Tablet/HD, LD/ML, LD, Rest&#93; for poor trainers.&#41; <BR>When using the first method, i usually Meditate/Shoot/Leap/Study, occasionaly substituting study for Shoot or Dodge when Int is way above the other two. For the second method, I Meditate/Shoot/Dodge.  <BR> <BR>It has lifespan pattern Type 2, which is shorter childhood and longer old age. I feel that this is the type of monster that should stay away from drugs when young, since their childhoods are already fairly short. Possibly drugs could be used during old age. Ghosts do not have any good/evil techs, so there is no need to worry about changing its nature, although I feel good natured monsters are a LOT easier to train. Thier techs are: <BR> <BR> <BR>Close Range: <BR>&#40;P&#41; Toy Hammer      D/D/-/- 11  Basic <BR>&#40;P&#41; Charge          E/B/-/- 10  Basic <BR>&#40;P&#41; Uppercut        B/B/C/E 50  Special <BR>&#40;P&#41; Combination     B/B/B/E 55  Special <BR> <BR>Mid-Close: <BR>&#40;I&#41; Energy Shot     E/S/E/E 16  Hit <BR>&#40;I&#41; Surprise        E/D/C/E 17  Withering <BR>&#40;I&#41; Astonishment    D/D/B/E 32  Withering <BR> <BR>Mid-Far <BR>&#40;I&#41; Necromancy      E/S/D/E 25  Hit <BR>&#40;I&#41; Dove Bomb       C/E/D/E 23  Heavy <BR>&#40;I&#41; Pigeon Bomb     B/E/D/E 30  Heavy <BR> <BR>Far <BR>&#40;I&#41; Magic Card      D/D/D/C 19  Sharp <BR>&#40;I&#41; Magic Cards     C/D/D/C 29  Sharp <BR> <BR>Chains: <BR>Magic card -&#62; Magic cards  <BR>Energy shot -&#62; Necromancy  <BR>Dove Bomb -&#62; Pigeon bomb  <BR>Surprise -&#62; Astonishment  <BR>Uppercut -&#62; Combination  <BR> <BR>I reccomend the techs in this order: Dove Bomb, Energy Shot, magic Card, Pigeon Bomb, Magic Cards, Surprise, Necromancy, Astonishment. The last three aren&#39;t really necessary, and a ghost can get along just fine without them, but Suprise is nice for going against other antagonizers. Don&#39;t even bother with Combination or Uppercut unless you are rasing a Pow based ghost, which i do NOT reccomend.  <BR> <BR>Ghost&#39;s biggest strength is its fast guts regeneration. It has the second highest in the game, tied with Pixie behind metelner. Because of this, it is great for the combo king strategy, but Astonishment makes it a potential Antagonizer. Also, high int/skill/life make it a good one hit wonder. I prefer the one hit wonder method, but occasionaly change depending on the enemy. If it is a slow enemy or a tank &#40;like Golems and ColorPandoras&#41; i will pigeon bomb when the hit% is between 50% and 60%. If has low life, use magic cards until they hit, and if they aren&#39;t dead, but close, then use energy shot/necromancy. Against antagonizers, your best bet is to antagonize them back with suprise/astonishment, since the ghost can recover guts quicker than them anyway. Combination is a great move for ghosts, since it is large accurate damage, and the 50 guts is meaningless to the ghosts fast regen. rate, but since it is power based, it is a waste.  <BR>The ghosts biggest weakness is that it has no close range attacks. When fighting a ghost &#40;Offrey in C Class&#41; exploit this by staying close to him. When using your ghost, use that Triangle button to keep away! Don&#39;t get in close unless you are going up against Pixie, and need a quick breather. Their other weakness is one hit wonders. Since they have no life or defense, speed is their only way to survive, and a single lucky blow WILL KO a ghost. Try to KO the opponent quickly, or wither it down so that it can&#39;t use its high guts cost accurate power moves.  <BR> <BR>This is my first FAQ, any feedback/comments/criticisms/suggestions would be appreciated. Next FAQ: Dragons
