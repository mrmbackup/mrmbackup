Okay, it&#39;s time to get some things straightened out about cross-over techniques, so let&#39;s start listing off any that seem to come up, shall we? I should get things out of the way now by saying that Fire Breath is NOT a Dragon-Sub-Breed-only crossover move for Zuums. I got it while using a Zuum/Gali combination, so it just can&#39;t be. On the other hand, crossover moves CAN be inherited by creatures of the the &#34;wrong&#34; subbreed, as long as a parent of the &#34;right&#34; subbreed had them. I have a KautRoarKaut &#40;Beaclon/Bajarl&#41; descended from a Melcarba &#40;Beaclon/Henger&#41; who knows Fist Missile, because his parent knew it. I also have an Antares &#40;I don&#39;t know why I love these specific kinds of Centaurs, I just do. Arrowhead sub-breed for the ignorant&#41; that has Death Thrust, which from the icon alone will tell you should only be used by a Reaper &#40;Centaur/Joker&#41;. I could never get my first few Antares monsters to learn it, but as soon as I threw in a Reaper who had learned it...BANG! The coolest-looking Centaur move is mine to plant wherever I please. Keep in mind that this would only apply to Heavy, Withering, Hit, and Sharp Techs, because Special Techs CAN&#39;T be passed on to a new generation. So Death Finale &#40;I THINK that&#39;s a Special Tech&#41; can&#39;t be passed on from a Lilim to a new breed of Pixie. Sorry.  <BR> <BR>Anyway, let&#39;s start listing the crossover moves we see, hmmm?  <BR> <BR>&#42;Kato- Gains Lick &amp; Licking from Suezo or Mocchi, and Bolt from Tiger.  <BR> <BR>&#42;Pixie- Gains Phantom Claw from Kato, and Death Finale from Joker.  <BR> <BR>&#42;Hopper- Gains Phantom Claw from Kato, and Lightning from Tiger.  <BR> <BR>&#42;Arrowhead- Gains Cyclone from Golem and Fist Missile from Henger.  <BR> <BR>&#42;Beaclon- Gains Fist Missile from Henger.  <BR> <BR>&#42;Golem- Gains Fist Missile from Henger&#40;?&#41;.  <BR> <BR>&#42;Centaur- Gains Death Thrust from Joker &#40;Joker does not have this&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Any others spotted?  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 06, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>someone was saying earlier that ducken inherited eye beam from suezo when you make it a ticken.. actually ducken gets eye beam on its own. -debunk-  <BR> <BR>-- Jonas Trip &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rocketmallow@hotmail.com">rocketmallow@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, January 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>oh yeah, and i thought i&#39;d point out that fist missile in arrowheads doesnt need hengers..
