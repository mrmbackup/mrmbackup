 INTRODUCTION <BR> <BR>A few questions before going on. <BR> <BR>1.&#41; Are you strapped for cash? <BR>2.&#41; Do you find the idea of lots of reloading offensive, either timewise or ethically? <BR>3.&#41; Are you not willing to wait long periods of time to see results? <BR>4.&#41; Are you a casual trainer who&#39;s simply not interested in maxxing out all of your monsters stats?   <BR>5.&#41; Are you a free-style trainer who doesn&#39;t like to follow a preset raising plan? <BR> <BR>If you answered yes to any of the above questions then I suggest you TURN BACK NOW.  This method is not for you.  For those of you who&#39;ve answered No to the above questions, here are a few more... <BR> <BR>1.&#41; Are you tired of having your monster&#39;s butt kicked by ridiculously powerful opponents such as Most and Akirel and you want revenge? <BR>2.&#41; Do you want to raise a monster that&#39;ll leave your MR2 playing friends in awe and honestly say you did it without a Gameshark? <BR>3.&#41; Do you want to see what a monster raised to it&#39;s fullest potential would be like? <BR>4.&#41; Do you want to max out your monster&#39;s stats and don&#39;t care what it takes to do so short of using a Gameshark or similar device? <BR> <BR>If you answered yes to any of the the questions immediately above here, read on. I think you&#39;re going to enjoy this. :&#41; <BR> <BR>NOTE:  There is no guarantee that this method will max out the stats on a particlar monster, especially 1st or 2nd generation monsters &#40;although it is possible&#41;  Also, be prepared for a wait, as this method takes a long time to follow &#40;approx. 30 - 50 yrs. of game time&#41;.  If the long wait time scares you, here are a couple of options: <BR> <BR>1.&#41; Use another raising method that is not as time consuming. <BR>2.&#41; Use this method only in your monster&#39;s 3rd stage &#40;See Turbo Prime for more on this&#41;. <BR> <BR>EXAMPLES <BR> <BR>Here are a couple of examples of monsters raisied with my prototype method, not that the 2nd monster was raisied in this method only during stage 3. <BR> <BR>Fiera  2nd gen Phoenix &#40;Phoenix/Phoenix&#41;  LIF 807  POW  321  INT 999  SKI  999  SPD  999  DEF  999  Total - 5124 <BR>Age:  7 yrs.  5 mons.  Trainer:  Dark Phoenix <BR> <BR>Korkassus  2nd gen  Garuda &#40;Durahan/Phoenix&#41;  LIF 828  POW 999  INT 725  SKI 999  SPD 801  DEF 999  Total- 5351 <BR>Age:  8 yrs.  3 mons.  Trainer:  Vheod <BR> <BR> <BR>Now here are some examples of some monsters that have been maxxed out by my method.  Note that I won&#39;t include the stats as it will only be restating the obvious. <BR> <BR>Phoebe  Type:3rd gen Undine&#40;Undine/Undine&#41; Age: 7 years 3 mons.  Trainer: RNA <BR> <BR>Jay-Jay  Type:3rd gen Jill&#40;Jill/Jill&#41; Age: 9 yrs 8 mons.  Trainer: Rion Beyoulve <BR> <BR>Hope  Type:2nd gen Durahan&#40;Durahan/Durahan&#41; Age: 7 yrs 10 mons.  Trainer: The Man <BR> <BR>Lil&#39; Killa  Type:4th gen Tricker&#40;Wracky/Joker&#41; Age: 12 yrs 3 mons.  Trainer: Amazin&#39; Asian <BR> <BR>Oaktree  Type:8th gen Mock&#40;Mock/Mock&#41; Age: 13 yrs 0 mons.  Trainer: Rion Beyoulve <BR> <BR>Plaguebearer  Type:1st gen Cinder Bird&#40;Phoenix/????&#41; Age: 7 yrs 0 mons.  Trainer: MaJoBeRdOmEn &#40;sp?&#41;  <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t let the ages fool you!  Many of these monsters actually have a considerable amount of lifespan left.  Long lifespan is a common side effect of this method. <BR> <BR>THE PROCEDURE <BR> <BR>Legend:  NO = Nuts Oil. ML = Mint Leaf,  MB = Magic Banana,  Tab = Tablet,  TR/PX = Troron/Paradoxine,  Rest = self explanatory, PD = Powder, CD = Candy <BR> <BR>Items you should have:  3 Gemini Pots, 3 Sculptures, 3 Dino Tails,  Golden Peach, Silver Peach, some Paradoxines or Trorons &#40;optional&#41; <BR> <BR>Some things before going on:  Make sure your monster likes or tolerates tablets.  Also,  learn how to use the Magic Banana properly. <BR> <BR>HOW TO USE THE MAGIC BANANA <BR> <BR>In case you haven&#39;t read any posts about the effects of magic bananas, here is what they do.  When given to your monster,  one of four different effects occur.  The effect you want is the 10 point DECREASE in loyalty.  Why, you ask?  Check out the section titled &#34;HOW IT WORKS&#34; for details.  When you using the banana, I suggest you keep two saves, one before giving the banana, and one after getting the desired result.  That way, if something unpleasant happens to your monster, you can back up to the first save if you need to give an item or the second one if you do not. <BR> <BR>THE KEY CONCEPT <BR> <BR>What I&#39;m about to say next is the key to my methods success and is what makes my method different from all the others. <BR> <BR>Unless stated otherwise,  you will only raise your monster on the last week of each month. <BR> <BR>In other words, you will only have your primary monster on the ranch on the 4th week of each month.  During the other 3 weeks of the month, you will keep a &#34;dummy&#34; monster on the ranch while the main monster remains frozen in the lab .   What you do with your dummy monster on the remaining 3 weeks is up to you.   Why all this trouble?  Refer to the Section &#34;HOW IT WORKS&#34; to find out.  Oh, one more thing,  &#42;&#42;&#42;failure and cheating are not tolerated in this method&#42;&#42;&#42;.  Reload if either one happens.  Because of the wait periods involved between turns, I recommend saving at the beginning of every turn that you raise your monster. <BR> <BR>STAGE 1 -  Childhood <BR> <BR>During this period, when you monster remains small.  You&#39;ll want to work on Skill if at all possible.  Remember to feed it tablets.  Contrary to what others say, Milk doesn&#39;t have any additional effect other than a cheap source of nourishment while the monster is still a baby.  You should follow this item and training pattern. <BR> <BR>&#40;NO,NO,NO,NO&#41;  &#40;Shoot,Shoot,Shoot,Shoot&#41; <BR> <BR>Should your monster grow fat or slim,  substitute a Nuts Oil with a powder or candy, respectively.  Once  you monster&#39;s loyalty is near 100,  you can substitute every other Nuts Oil with a Magic Banana. <BR> <BR> <BR>What if my monster sucks at skill?  What do I do then?  Well, if your monsters sucks at skill or power or both.  You may need to use Troron or Paradoxine while raising,  I prefer Paradoxine because the results are much more dramatic than that of Troron.  If you use either while raising,  train in another stat &#40;preferably LIF&#41; and use this item pattern <BR> <BR>&#40;TR/PX,NO,NO,NO&#41; <BR> <BR>If your monster increases in size, stop this pattern and refer to Stage 2. <BR> <BR>STAGE 2  - Adolescence <BR> <BR>Now is when you&#39;ll REALLY start to train your monster.  First,  out of the 4 hard drills,  find out which works best, 2nd best and on.  Start on your best stat and raise it up to about 800 or so, if your monster&#39;s really good at that stat, you may want to consider stopping at about 650 or so.  DON&#34;T WASTE TRAINING,  if one of your stats is boosted all the way to 999 and you&#39;re getting 0&#39;s on the drills, you&#39;re wasting training.  At any rate, work on your best stat first, the your 2nd best, 3 rd best, on so on.  Follow this pattern here: <BR> <BR>&#40;HD,HD,HD,HD&#41;  &#40;NO,MB,NO,MB&#41; <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re monster is getting fat or thin,  substitute a Magic Banana with a powder or candy.  If your monster&#39;s loyalty drops too low, then substitute a MB  with a Nuts OIl and wait for the loyalty to recover.  If your monster is only neutral to tablets you may want to insert a Mint Leaf every other month or so to avoid stress. <BR> <BR>Your monster may begin to go on errantries at this stage.  When you decide to send your monster to errantry  bring your monster out on the &#42;&#42;1st&#42;&#42; week of the month.  Save, and give it a Nuts Oil, and send it on the errantry.  &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;Make sure that your monster learns a tech on the errantry&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;, if not, then reload.  Once it returns,  immeditately freeze it and bring it out on the 4th week, give it a Nuts Oil, then rest it,  then resume the training pattern.  Make sure to space your errantries about 2 months of raising time apart to give your monster a chance to recover. Also, you may want to begin working up the Official tournament ladder at this time. If you decide to so , bring it out, give a Nuts Oil, then battle, and makes sure you give it another Nuts Oil the next raising week after the tournament. When you monster changes size again, you&#39;re at Stage 3. <BR> <BR>STAGE 3 - Adulthood <BR> <BR>Here we are, the &#34;prime&#34;.  In this stage of your monsters life,   its stat gains will increase at rate unequaled in any other period of its life.  To make sure it gets the full benefit of this,  do no errantries here.  The raising pattern here is identical to that of Stage 2.  Keep your Gold Peach handy here.  Give it when your monster&#39;s stat gain begin to drop or 1 year after the start of its prime, whichever comes first.  This will effectively extend your monster&#39;s prime and allow it the obtain ever higher stats.  If you&#39;re no longer satisfied with your monster&#39;s gains, go on to the freezing process. <BR> <BR>FREEZING PROCESS <BR> <BR>First, make sure you&#39;re monster is at or beyond S rank.  If not,  work it  up now!  Here&#39;s where all your hard work pays off.  First, beat the Class S offical tourney, if you haven&#39;t already, then keep your monster frozen until a Major 4 battle comes up.  Make sure it&#39;s very well going into the battle,  give it a Nuts Oils if it&#39;s not.  &#42;&#42;&#42;It&#39;s more important to save every week than ever at this point, and SAVE BEFORE YOU GIVE IT AN ITEM&#42;&#42;&#42;.  The reason will be explained later.  Anyway,  make sure you get a least 30 total points in stat gains.   If you get less, consider reloading and trying again. &#40;Of course, if you already have 4 stats or more maxxed out you may have to bend this rule a bit:&#41;&#41;.  After the battle,  immediately freeze,  bring it out on the 4th week of the month,Give it a Nuts Oil, then rest it.  On the week of the next tournament, use a Magic Banana, battle then repeat the process.  If your monster gets too fat or disloyal,  skip the resting and Magic Banana parts and simply give it a Nuts Oil on the week of the next tournament.  Repeat this as often as needed until the problem is remedied,  then resume the normal pattern.  IF YOUR MONSTER DIES,  reload then IMMEDIATELY give it the Silver Peach.  What you decide to do with your monster&#39;s remaining weeks of life from here on out are up to you. <BR> <BR>HOW IT WORKS <BR> <BR>A couple of questions might be asked about this method. <BR> <BR>1&#41;  Why do I only raise my monster on the 4th week of each month? <BR> <BR>2&#41;  Why all those Magic Bananas? <BR> <BR>Answer 1: <BR>The reason the monster is only raised on the 4th week of each month is to take better advantage of the foods that are given at the beginning of every month.  Certain foods,  if liked or tolerated,  can relieve stress and help the monster keep it&#39;s weight up during hard training.  During normal, continuous raising,  the monster only benefits from this boost once every four weeks &#40;once a month&#41;.  If we look at my method&#39;s item pattern &#40;this time including Tablets&#41; if I raised my monster in a normal continous manner would look like this: <BR> <BR>NO,MB,NO,MB,Tab.NO,MB,NO,MB,Tab...... <BR> <BR>Obviously,  my method of  constant hard drilling would not be feasible with this pattern because:  my monster&#39;s loyalty will plummet &#40;because of the Bananas&#41;, it will get stressed out &#40;not enough stress relief&#41;  and my monster will quickly become Skinny &#40;too much work, too little food&#41;.  Now, if I only raise my monster on the 4th week of each month,  those other 3 weeks without the tablets are eliminated and my item pattern looks something like this: <BR> <BR>NO,Tab,MB,Tab,NO,Tab,MB,Tab,NO,Tab,MB,Tab,NO,Tab,MB,Tab..... <BR> <BR>With those extra tablets inserted,  my monster&#39;s stress and weight are kept under control,  allowing for a pattern of continuous hard drilling that&#39;s not advisable under other method.  Also,  the tablets cause my monster to recover loyalty FAST,  countering the loyalty drops caused by the Magic Bananas. <BR> <BR>Answer 2: <BR> <BR>The reason for all the Magic Bananas is to increase lifespan!   When you give the Magic Banana to your monster you get the -10 loyalty result,  you get an extra week of lifespan.  That&#39;s good!  However,  you&#39;ve obviously lost 10 loyalty.  That&#39;s bad!  What to do....  Well , with all the tablets given to the monster with my method,  the monster recovers loyalty VERY FAST,  allowing frequent usage of bananas.  For  example,  RNA&#39;s Undine Phoebe recovered loyalty so fast that it allowed RNA to give his Undine a Magic Banana every other week.  The end result -  the Undine was fed over 100 magic bananas during it&#39;s lifetime.  100 bananas = 100 weeks lifespan.   That&#39;s two years of extra lifespan!  Who wouldn&#39;t want that? <BR> <BR>TURBO PRIME <BR> <BR>This is a mini-version of my method which can be used with other raising methods for people that might be too intimidated  my my method as a whole.  Instead of using the method through the whole of the monster&#39;s life.  Just simply use the method during your monster&#39;s prime in order to take full advantage of that critical period of your monsters life.   The Garuda Korkassus,  mention in the examples above,  was actually  raised using RNA&#39;s method combined with &#34;Turbo Prime&#34;.  As you can see.  the results are quite impressive.  I&#39;d like to thank Vheod for this idea and the title of this mini-method. <BR> <BR>CREDITS <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to thank the following trainers for their contributions.  I&#39;ve couldn&#39;t have done this without them: <BR> <BR>RNA -  It was working to improve his method that started all this.  His input, suggestions, and encouragement were all very helpful. <BR> <BR>Vheod  -  For his support and the development of &#34;Turbo Prime&#34; <BR> <BR>The Man -  His testing and promotion of my method helped a great deal. <BR> <BR>Rion Beyoulve -  For showing once again that my method CAN max out a monster&#39;s stats. <BR> <BR>Azn-Beast - For his insights and support. <BR> <BR>Zoinks - Though he left before I came to this board, one of his posts proved to be the key to developing this method. <BR> <BR>If anyone has any questions about my method,  ask me or another trainer who has success with this method. <BR> <BR>Good Luck and Happy Ranching!

 OK DP...Glad to see your method on here. I have tried RNA&#39;s and The Man&#39;s method now it&#39;s time for yours. Biggest difference I see between yours and those other methods is 1.&#41;Mint Leaf is not a regular item given in the schedule. 2.&#41; You incorporate Troron/Paradoxine in the regiment, where theirs is &#34;optional&#34;. Now, it&#39;s time to go through some CD&#39;s to see what I can train. I definitely want to stick with a good monster. I guess it&#39;ll probably be a Durahan, or I will raise another purebred Hopper to see if it does any better than RNA&#39;s method and compare the two at each stage etc. Oh well, looking forward to trying this one.

 Actually, Troron and Paradoxine are &#34;optional&#34; in this method as well.  Use them if you think your monster utterly stinks in power and/or skill, it&#39;s your call.  Some monsters, such a Wrackys, benefit a great deal from it.  On some monsters, it may not be such a hot idea.  Again, it&#39;s your call.

 It would seem to me, that you would want to use it, since SKI, regardless of any monster, is a hard stat to train, since there is no HD for it. I have no Paradoxine, but I think it&#39;s at the Torles expedition in one of the caves. If that is incorrect DP, could you please give me it&#39;s correct location?

 Turbo Prime is a wonderful thing. Its for you if your lazy and want good stats. It would probably work even better with The Mans method. <BR> <BR>Remember DP, FARMER. FARMER.

 This meathod is the best one I&#39;ve tried. I just finished raising my phoenix &#40;Ehrgiez&#41; and his stats are 999, 170, 999, 999, 999, 999. He&#39;s 8yrs and still a bit of life span left in him &#40;about 50 weeks of life span left not including battles&#41;, and I&#39;m rising that POW with the &#34;freezing process&#34;. Most people only go for stat gains but I sacrificed his POW for him to go on some errantries, now he knows all the techs except flame cannon. THANX DP!

 Here&#39;s a suggestion for alleviating the money problem.I&#39;m using the Dark Phoenix method for the first time, and after 2 yrs in the &#34;prime monsters&#34; life,have more cash than I started with. You basically just use Wildcards method for your &#34;throwaway monster&#34;&#40;Hereafter called secondary&#41;. Get them to B class,and stay there,fighting in A and B tournaments. My first secondary has a purse of about 200,000 Gs,and that doesn&#39;t include the items&#40;Gold,silver,larox,disc chips,etc.&#41; Granted, I&#39;m using 2nd gen monsters for the secondary, but it could be done with first gens. If you didn&#39;t have a lot of G&#39;s to begin with, I&#39;d suggest getting the secondary to B class first,then starting the DP training on your prime monster. I use light training on the secondary,as in Wildcard, I think?,and fight in every non official I can,excluding the 4th week. Months without a B or A non-official tournament,I do some heavy training. If the secondary gets fat, I do some more heavy training. I&#39;m now on my second secondary monster&#40;aaagh,redundancy&#41;, and by the time I&#39;m done, those throwaways should give me a decent 3rd gen monster. <BR> <BR> A couple additional tips for your secondaries.Choose a couple monsters that will combine well. I&#39;m using a sloth beetle and a henger to get a melcarba. <BR>  Use monsters that have decent lifespan,to maximize earning potential.Feed gold and silver peaches,ditto.

 Hey Argos... I&#39;ve been trying something along those lines. The money wasn&#39;t an issue at the beginning, I had about 231000G when I started his method, and my Undine is now 1 yr. 8 mos. Funds are 228000G now. I am training my Zilla just for the heck of it, and he is C class fighting in those battles, and going on expeditions. he just got back from Torles with 2 more Firestones, and Silver. I sold those for 14000G at shop, so you can see, that with battles, and selling extra items that I don&#39;t need in inventory &#40;already have 2 firestone, 2 artemis statue, 2 gemini cups and 2 dino tails&#41; it can get you some extra money for his expensive method!!

 Good idea,Tony. I really didn&#39;t do any expeditions,but it looks like a way to keep up your money. Of course you lose&#40;or postpone&#41; two week 4s of training your prime. Plus battles are accompanied by stat gains,which hopefully transfer to the next gen. On the other hand, I think expeditions use less lifespan. I just hate the idea of &#34;throwing away&#34; a perfectly good monster.

It seemed like a waste to me to throw one away too. Plus the battles and expeditions break up the monotony of DP&#39;s method. Allows you to do a few things different. I&#39;m not super concerned with his training skills. I may  combine my Zilla with a Hopper I have in the freezer and hope for a pretty good combo. I actually tried it, and got the &#34;This one&#39;s all up to you&#34; messgae, so it may be OK.

 Tony,this one&#39;s all up to you is the second worst message. See combining prospects under breeding/combining. It straightened me out. <BR> <BR> The raising of the secondary monster seems to be an art all in itself.I&#39;m doing more heavy training with the Henger.Once at B/A class, you can mainly use nuts oil and candy.There are enough battles to make mint leaves unneeded. The months with no battles I do errantries. The second gen henger could probably max a couple stats, and win M-4&#39;s. <BR> Should have a couple decent monsters in addition to the prime when it&#39;s all said and done

 Yeah that was the thing.  It was just kinda hard do follow.  Btw, I&#39;m raising an Leziena with DP&#39;s method but I also want it to be evil to learn lightning and thunderbolt but its very hard to keep it at bad and the sweet j&#39;s really faten Liz up, what with all the tablets and bananas in her diet. And when I give her the jellies I ofeten have to rest her, which also fattens her.  How do I best raise an evil monster with DP&#39;s or will I just have to get a heel bdg?

 Wolvie, once the monster&#39;s bad it should stay there unless you praise it for greats?Cheats mean reload in dp&#39;s method,so I know you&#39;re not scolding cheats. I couldn&#39;t stand all the extra reloads so I moved my Genocider to good. Did you read the archives regarding nature?

 yeah, but after a couple of greats, it went to neutral. I just couldn&#39;t stand to not praise it. force of habit I guess.  Oh well I got it to bad now. thanks

 Addendum to DP&#39;s method.  You can actually get your monster to have 2 bananas back to back weeks.  In order to do this you&#39;ll need your monster to like tablets and and you have to have alot of patience because you will need to always have greats on drills.  when your monster is in 2nd stage its that turnwhere you&#39;ll need  to feed it a no., do so but get a great on the hd and the following your loy. should be around 100. then the banana as usual and then hd like dp instructs but make sure you get great again and praise it for doing so. why? because your loy. will shoot up greatly close to ten, I get around 7 after the tablet. Your loy. should be around mid-to high 90s., high enough to give it another banana.  So what about that seems well message you&#39;ll get w/o the no.? The key is to now use an ld instead of hd and make sure you get a great as well.  You should now get a 2nd seems well msg. so that&#39;s when you use a nuts oil.  And remember always get greats. It&#39;ll eventually happen, becuase it seems that the rate of reload to get greats are slightly higher than the rate to get -10 loy. for bananas. I&#39;m doing this with my Leziena, Liz. So what do you think guys.
