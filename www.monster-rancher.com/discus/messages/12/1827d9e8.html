<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'torey_luvullo'-!>
I’ve had a number of requests to post my training methods and styles as one complete system, so here goes.  Keep in mind that I’m a flaming windbag at heart, so this is going to be long, detailed and full of redundancies.  If you can survive my writing style, beating Most will be a snap! <BR> <BR>PART ONE:  Assumptions and preparations. <BR> <BR>Well, for a method that &#40;I feel&#41; isn’t that complicated once you get it started, there are a bunch of things you should know about it beforehand... <BR> <BR>1&#41;  This method isn’t as expensive as some of the others, but it does require money up front &#40;so to speak&#41;, as you’ll be avoiding battles until S-Class.  Figure 100K for an average-lifespan monster.  You will make most or all of it back from Big 4 tournaments, if all goes well. <BR> <BR>2&#41;  You will need a Fire Stone or Lump of Ice in your inventory.  &#40;One or the other will do.  Peaches will &#40;obviously&#41; be nice, too.  Why you need one of these is covered in their respective entries in the FAQs section. <BR> <BR>3&#41;  If your monster dislikes Tablets, try another monster &#40;or retry the combination or Disc Stone until it’s at LEAST neutral&#41;.  Tablets are by FAR the best food for your monster, and play a critical role in stress reduction in my systems.   <BR> <BR>4&#41;  There are a lot of posts you should be familiar with.  Just about everything in FAQs, when you come right down to it, but in particular:  <BR> <BR>List of Items &amp; Foods &#40;in FAQs&#41; <BR>Effect of Stress &amp; Fatigue on Lifespan &#40;in FAQs, VERY important&#41; <BR>Lifespan of 38 Purebreed monsters &#40;in FAQs&#41; <BR>Monster Attributes &#40;and their effectiveness in drills&#41;  &#40;in FAQs&#41; <BR>Tech Chains list &#40;by The Man&#41; &#40;in FAQs&#41; <BR> <BR>In short, know what stats your monster will be good at raising and which he’ll be terrible at, what kind of attacks you’ll want your monster to have, what attacks you need to unlock tech chains to get to those desired attacks, how drills and other events affect stress and fatigue, and how to use items to AVOID any lifespan hits you can. <BR> <BR>PART TWO:  Choosing a monster to raise. <BR> <BR>What is a monster?  It’s a pile of points with attacks associated with it. If you get its pile of points large enough, ANY monster can enter the Hall of Fame.  This method is meant to make any monster live long enough <BR>to amass a whopping pile of points.  Therefore, you don’t have to lose TOO much sleep over what kind of monster you want to train... pick one that seems to fit your preferred fighting style and has stat-gain rates you can live with.  I’ve raised both a pure Joker &#40;350 weeks lifespan&#41; and <BR>a Durahan/Arrowhead &#40;500 weeks&#41; with this method and both turned out fine, so &#40;while helpful&#41; a long lifespan isn’t an absolute necessity. <BR> <BR>Some things to keep in mind: <BR> <BR>&#42;  Try to get a monster that likes Tablets.  This will make a small but significant difference in stress management, as well as boosting Loyalty quickly.  A monster that’s neutral to Tablets can still work, but is a little trickier to handle.  If your monster dislikes Tablets, find another <BR>monster, as no other food’s nearly as efficient. <BR> <BR>&#42;  Know your monster’s rates of stat acquisition.  In other words, what stats will go up quickly from drills, and what stats will go up at a snail’s pace?  If you don’t have the figures handy, a little trial-and-effort will usually suffice.  Keep in mind that the Swim drill has a bug, <BR>where it’s actually using the LIF stat-rate to build DEF and vice versa. You can use the light drills as a better benchmark for stat comparisons. <BR> <BR>&#42;  Know your monster’s attacks.  A good monster won’t need a horde of attack techniques, because it’ll have a handful that it relies on time and time again.  Therefore, you want to know what those attacks are AND what stats you need to train to get them.   <BR> <BR>Look at the technique lists and try and find the most efficient moves you can, based on the fighting style you prefer.  Your monster should be building its SKI up as high as possible, so don’t be totally afraid of low-hit-%  <BR>moves, but I tend to prefer ones with higher hit-% and low-to-medium damage because &#40;a&#41; they tend to cost less, making misses more manageable, and &#40;b&#41; if you build your POW/INT up high enough they’ll still do good damage. Figure out whether you want your monster to use POW- or INT-based attacks, and plan your training accordingly. <BR> <BR>If a monster has a LOT of tech chains &#40;Nitons, Monols, etc. can apply here&#41; and the attacks you really want are stuck in them, consider creating a throwaway monster of that type, fighting it almost constantly and concentrating on getting techs via Errantries, and then breeding THAT and <BR>another monster together to get your real contender.  If you’re trying to build an all-star Hall-of-Famer, you won’t want to fight much &#40;if at all&#41; outside of building ranks and Big 4 tournaments, so you’ll be stuck with your entry-level attacks unless you build a preliminary monster accordingly. <BR> <BR>When combining monsters, esp. if you’ve built a tech-heavy throwaway monster as a parent, try to focus on starting with the good techniques INSTEAD of starting with great stats.  If you can get a good or better combination <BR>and start with high stats, that’s wonderful, don’t get me wrong, but techs are often harder to come by and cost you five or six weeks of lifespan every time you go on Errantries.  Stats are comparatively easy to raise. <BR> <BR>Disc Chips can also be your friend here, if your target monster will be deficient in some stat.  For example, Golems are traditionally horrible at SKI.  You want SKI.  You want LOTS of SKI.  Therefore, Henger chips would be a very good idea &#40;not that they’re ever a BAD idea&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; Know your monster’s nature.  Some monsters need Bad or Worst nature to get certain attacks.  Unfortunately, this plays hell with any kind of regular training system, as that means many more failures and cheats &#40;which both affect stress and fatigue&#41;.  If you need to get a Bad attack, <BR>get it QUICKLY once you have the opportunity and then shift back to Good nature with Sour Jellies and appropriate scolding.  If you LIKE having Bad or Worst monsters, there are other methods that may be more appropriate...  &#40;I mean, you CAN raise a Joker by this method, but it’ll end up as a Good-natured Joker.  Caveat emptor.&#41; <BR> <BR>With that and everything else I might’ve forgotten to mention in mind, off to the methodologies...
