<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:chimeraman101@aol.com>Nate Railsback</A></B> on <B>Thursday, May 18, 2000 - 03:21 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 Okay, I&#39;ve finally got done raising my master Undine, and I have to say that it&#39;s possibly the most impressive monster I&#39;ve raised overall in the game, with an even bigger potential than the great Durahan or Phoenix!  Undines not only get great gains in all stats but Power &#40;which they don&#39;t need as much, and that overall helps them...but I&#39;ll get to that&#41;, but they have very high Guts Regeneration and tons of quality moves, to boot!  As far as the low Power helping them...well, they don&#39;t really have any truly good Power-based techs &#40;except Dolphin Blow does at least LOOK cool&#41;, and the low natural Power rating really helps to dissuade someone from working on those.  Their weak Power doesn&#39;t constitute as big of a weakness as other high-Defense monsters, either, because they can get even higher Speed to reduce their hits enough to deal with Power-based attacks.  Still, anyone raising a master Undine really should get its Power up to about 200, so that it can&#39;t be easily killed with Power-based Hit Techs. <BR> <BR>ANYWAY...like I said, these creatures get great stats in the other areas, which is very rare &#40;Even Phoenix has a little trouble with Life, and a pure Durahan can&#39;t do Speed very easily&#41;.  This makes it very easy to create a near-invincible monster, and if a maxed-out Undine was placed against a maxed-out Durahan or Phoenix, it would have the edge based on its own high Guts Regen and its array of Withering attacks.  You may be wondering what my own Undine looked like...so here goes: <BR> <BR>Evian- 5th Generation Pure Undine <BR>Age: 6 years, 8 months &#40;near death&#41; <BR>Record: 84 Wins, 0 Losses, 60 KOs <BR>Achievements: All M4 and Legends Cup &#40;Poritoka&#41; won by KO. &#40;I bet she could have beaten Most easily, but not by a KO&#41;. <BR>Likes: Tablet/Nate <BR>Dislikes: Meat <BR> <BR>Life: 803 <BR>Power: 369 <BR>Intelligence: 869 <BR>Skill: 870 <BR>Speed: 877 <BR>Defense: 786 <BR> <BR>&#42;All Techniques <BR> <BR>The only way in which an Undine loses out to a Phoenix or Durahan is its natural lifespan, which can&#39;t compete with theirs.  It took several generations of careful care to reach this, not to mention that she has a few Phoenixes in her family tree. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t let her status as one of the best monsters scare away you inexperienced trainers, though.  An Undine can easily make it under your influence, as well as bring home frequent Ocean Stones, the highest-priced gifts that any monster can bring home to you &#40;well, excluding the Spear or something&#41;, which will definately make her financially worth it. <BR> <BR>Tech Chains: <BR>&#42;Ice Sword -&#62; Ice Swords <BR>&#42;Aqua Whip &#40;Evil&#41; -&#62; Two Whips &#40;Evil&#41; <BR>&#42;Arrow &#40;Good&#41;-&#62; Ice Arrow &#40;Good&#41;-&#62; Icicle Arrow &#40;Good&#41; <BR>&#42;Aqua Wave -&#62; Aqua Waves <BR>&#42;Cold Whirl -&#62; Cold Storm <BR>&#42;Water Gun -&#62; Water Cannon <BR> <BR>Cross-Over Techs: None &#40;^_^&#41; <BR> <BR>Stand-Alone Techs: <BR>&#42;Dolphin Blow <BR>&#42;Splash &#40;Good&#41; <BR>&#42;Kiss <BR>&#42;Ice Coffin <BR>&#42;Hailstorm <BR>&#42;Vitalization &#40;Good&#41; <BR>&#42;Cold Geyser <BR> <BR>Battle Strategies: <BR>While some of her best moves are chained, it&#39;s very easy to get a great supply of moves right off the bat, such as Cold Geyser, Splash, Arrow/Ice Arrow, Kiss, Cold Fog, Aqua Wave, and Ice Coffin.  For those of you who love to hide completely out of range of all attacks and build up Guts before shooting in, strking, and getting out, Hailstorm and Cold Geyser are ideal &#40;good accuracy &#43; a nice Force/Sharpness balance&#41;. <BR> <BR>A good Undine can take advantage of any combat strategy: Splash, Aqua Whip, Two Whips, and her power attacks like Cold Whirl, Cold Storm, Water Gun, and Water Cannon all have great Withering ratings that make her an easy Antagonizer, and her low-cost moves like Cold Fog, Arrow, Aqua Wave, and Cold Geyser allow her to Combo Queen away.  For One-Hit Wonders, Water Cannon is every bit as devastating as Fire Wave, because while it may not have the same actual Force rating, its Accuracy and Withering are much higher, making it a much surer bet that the enemy will not only be heavily damaged, but stunned for long enough to allow her to finish the job with other strong moves.  You don&#39;t NEED a Guts Miser strategy with an Undine, because the frequent dodges and her high Guts Regen will easily allow her to rack up a huge Guts rating.  To top it all off, even if a hit DOES get through a devastates her &#40;but leaves her standing&#41;, she can weave out of the way of the follow-ups and heal herself with Vitalization, something that a Phoenix or Durahan can never do.  For directionless, beat-&#39;em-up-any-old-way types, Aqua Waves, Water Gun, Ice Arrow, and Icicle Arrow have the best all-around stats of any of her attacks. <BR> <BR>With all this, you might be scared that a fellow trainer wielding a high-grade Undine would be absolutely unstoppable- and if they&#39;re smart, that may be true.  But if they&#39;re just banking on stats rather than knowledge, you can have the advantage by taking in a creature with high Power, Skill, and Speed, and then keeping at short range &#40;try to lean towards Mid-range rather than close-as-can-be, though, otherwise you&#39;ll be threatened back into far range and trounced with a Water Cannon&#41;.  At this range, all an undine can do is Power-based attacks and Splash, which is a low-accuracy Withering move &#40;a Metalner can also laugh at an opponent from this range by being virtually unaffected by withering and low-force moves&#41;.  For those who are more Defense-oriented than Speed-oriented, and who can&#39;t compare with the Undine&#39;s Guts Regen, mid-range may be safer as long as the opponent hasn&#39;t learned Two Whips.  Above all, DON&#39;T let the opponent trap you in long or far range, otherwise you&#39;ll be trashed by her great selection of moves there. <BR> <BR>Last Note: I&#39;ve said it before, but Undine is the best Errantry-buster in the game.  You can design her to only have one Power-based attack &#40;which can be overridden by Splash&#41;, so she can&#39;t easily screw things up by using Power-based moves like a Kato or Phoenix can.  Also, her ability to get high stats in all defensive areas allow her to stay at any range with about equal safety, meaning that you don&#39;t have to worry about her going into the &#34;wrong&#34; spot on an opponent&#39;s move list as much. <BR> <BR>Anything I missed?  If not, long live the new Queen of Monsters, Undine!

 And some people thought my Undine I posted last week was detailed!! I&#39;ve never seen quite as detailed of a report on one monster. Congrats on this one. I do have a few questions for you though, Nate. <BR>1.&#41; Did you use any Peaches? <BR>2.&#41; Did you use a method for training? <BR>3.&#41; You say it&#39;s a 5th Gen Undine. Were are all of your combos for each generation fine, good, or great? If so, what did you use, because I&#39;m having a helluva time finding one to combine with my Undine to go to 2nd Gen?

 I started using the Golden Peaches since the second generation, and I was able to incorporate Silver Peaches starting at 3rd Gen.  It went like this: <BR> <BR>Mocchi/Tiger &#43; &#40;Can&#39;t remember&#41; &#43; Fire Feather = pure Phoenix named Hope. <BR> <BR>Slated untrained Angel &#43; Sueki Suezo &#43; Undine Slate = Evian 1. <BR> <BR>Hope &#43; Evian 1 = Esperanza &#40;Pure Phoenix&#41; <BR> <BR>Esperanza &#43; untrained pure Undine = Evian 2 <BR> <BR>Evian 2 &#43; untrained pure Phoenix = Evian 3. <BR> <BR>I just used my own ambling little method that probably wouldn&#39;t interest anyone, although it does tend to take advantage of Magic Bananas &#40;but not to Dark Phoenix&#39;s extent&#41; during the big stat-gaining life stage.
