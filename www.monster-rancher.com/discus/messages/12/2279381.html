I did a small analysis of weather effects on drills with a Brown Mask I was raising. I recorded the results of each drill of the same type &#40;The two I used were study and run&#41;, and what the weather was like during that week. First off, snow and rain are similar enough to be considered the same, so when I say rain, I mean both.  <BR> <BR>It seems that there is a weather effect on drills! It is very odd though... when doing drills in the rain, monster seem to score 1-2 points better. However, they are also more likely to fail. When the weather is clear, however, the monster has a much better chance of scoring &#39;great!&#39; on the drill.  <BR> <BR>This is by no means canonical. I only recorded about 35 drills, and only with one monster. Different breeds may be affected by different weather, etc etc. I urge anyone else who finds this interesting todo the same, and post your observations here, and what monster you used.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell &#40;oriole@capital.net&#41;, September 29, 1999  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>I will have to try that, I always wondered if my Durhan would Rush in the rain. Have you noticed that it seems easier to win tournaments if your monster is well rested?  <BR> <BR>-- Midnight &#40;Steve.p.sharrard@candescent.com&#41;, September 30, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I meant Rust in the rain not Rush  <BR> <BR>-- Midnight &#40;Steve.p.sharrard@candescent.com&#41;, September 30, 1999.
