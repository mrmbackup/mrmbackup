 Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but my Zorjil &#40;Jill/Suezo&#41; just got back from an errantry and I noticed the he sort of &#34;devolved&#34; and is shorter.  I always measure him at the Drill screen to keep track of what stage he&#39;s in.  He was at stage two, and now the top of his head moved from the middle of the &#34;Run&#34; box to the middle of the &#34;Pull&#34; box.  He was Normal before and after the errantry, and he still makes decent gains in Meditate after he shrank.  Has this happened to anyone else?

 I&#39;ve had the shrinkage happen to me once and only once, and it was involved in peaching  <BR>&#40;when I was still learning how that worked&#41;.  I used a Gold Peach on my Dragon a bit too early  <BR>&#40;since I didn&#39;t know it knocked you BACK a year, I used it early in his prime&#41;, and he went back  <BR>to adolescent for 6 months.  That&#39;s the only thing I can think of... <BR> <BR>PezCat <BR> <BR>=^..^=   =^..^=   =^..^= <BR>=^..^=   =^..^=   =^..^= <BR>=^..^=   =^..^=   =^.

 Same thing happened to me with my first silver peach usage. Nearly scared a few years&#39; growth off the player, as well as the monster!  <BR> <BR>Can&#39;t be sure why it&#39;d do it during an errantry, though. Maybe he&#39;s just moved down on the screen? I notice that they stand in different areas occasionally, making them look taller or shorter. The easiest way to measure them is at the &#39;feeding time&#39;, when they&#39;re standing against your barn.

 The type of shrinking that mike is pointing out is the type of shrinkage that happens alot in the drills screen.  <BR> <BR>Whenever you enter that screen, it seems as if the monster adjusts itself in a different position everytime. Sometimes, the repositioning is minor and other times, it is noticely more significant. It seems like the monster has shrunk, but it&#39;s only the because the monster&#39;s position has changed slightly. <BR> <BR>I find that measuring a monster&#39;s size in the drills screen is alot less reliable than the feeding screen.

 There are two reasons why a monster shrinks in battle, Anon.  It is either that the monster isn&#39;t full grown or you&#39;ve reset too many times.  It actually does effect the strength of blows if it&#39;s shrunken by resets, but I&#39;ve only seen this in &#34;D&#34; and &#34;C&#34; class.  It may also be nothing more than a glitch in my version, but those are my findings.

 My Icebergy &#40;Baku/Tiger&#41; shrank...during its prime &#40; he always scored 20 points in DEF = Hard Drill &#41; I fed him a gold peach...Thenafter, he shrank. He then scored 13-15 in his Hard Drill &#40;def&#41; for about 4 months. After that, he grew back then scored 20 in his HD.

 yep - the gold peach extends lifespan by turning back the lifespan clock.  if this throws the monster into a previous stage, so be it.  that is why i generally feed the peach ~1 year after the final growth spurt.
