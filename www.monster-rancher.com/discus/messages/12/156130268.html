 I just raised a pure Mock &#40;the one who appears after another monster dies&#41; from creation &#40;appearance?&#41; to death, without once getting any sort of notification from Colt about it&#39;s life stage. Nothing about it reaching adolescence, getting old, being ready to retire, nothing at all! Do you know what happened? &#40;He was about 5 and a half years.&#41; I saved frequently so I&#39;m okay as far as that goes, because I saw his statgains drop dramatically, but I&#39;m still irritated that I didn&#39;t get any sort of notifications whatsoever.

 Not particularly. I think we did five or six. We noticed a dramatic increase in its stat gains while it was young but were never told it was a crucial period in its life or anything. I hope I don&#39;t sound stupid being confused by this, but in years and years of playing I&#39;ve never had this happen. Thanks! &#40;By the way, amazing site!&#41;

 I&#39;m not entirely sure how the warnings work, but I think Colt will inform you THE WEEK it happens.  However, it&#39;s possible that you lost lifespan when this was supposed to happen &#40;stress, tournament, etc&#41; or you were out on errantry or expedition when the warning was supposed to come. <BR> <BR>So, for example let&#39;s say Colt was going to warn you when your monster had 50 weeks of life left.  When your monster had 52 weeks left you entered a tournament, and next week his remaining life was 45 weeks &#40;-1 for the week, -6 for a battle&#41;, so no warning came.

 That&#39;s what I was thinking. The timing of some of your activities happened to interfere with the notices.

 I think there may be a glitch that can stop triggering these events. <BR>I remember getting them way back in the day, but in the past real-life year of playing fresh from a new file, hundreds of years and dozens of monsters later I have not gotten a single warning, from the very first Zuum in the year 1000. I doubt I happened to miss the trigger week for every single monster I have raised, as many never did a single battle or errantry. I know you&#39;re supposed to get them but I think it&#39;s possible they just won&#39;t happen. I have the same problem with retirement warnings, too.
