 Some people report that after a while the item shop no longer offers items &#34;on sale&#34;. Others, with hundreds of years of game play still get the offers. Any ideas on what&#39;s going on?

 I think...I&#39;m not sure...that they stop when you reach like master class. I stopped getting mine and I&#39;m at year 50.

 I am in 1174 &amp; still get offers every few months. Of course, you don&#39;t get offered any new items to buy, but you do get the &#34;On Sale&#34; items.

 i am in the same situation as gunburn.  once i became a master, i stopped getting sales.  that was about year 1070.  and now, in year 1375, i can report that, once they stop, they never start up again.

 I stopped getting sales once I became master. I wonder if those who don&#39;t get them anymore have another unseen advantage in the game to compensate.

 I was still getting sales, as I remember, in my old game &#40;although I&#39;d have to give it a play to see&#41;. My SO is also still getting sales in his game, and he&#39;s a Master at least twice over.  <BR> <BR>However, in my present game, I stopped getting sales in around 1018, not long after I became a Master. So it may have something to do with Master status. Although if that&#39;s the case, how come my SO is still getting sales?

 i think we did this thread before, and i think people who keep getting sales slightly outnumber those who dont.  it may just be a random game setting, or it may be one of the few things tied in to the original answers - we just dont know.

 I&#39;ve gotten master rank more than once, and I still get  <BR>my sales. <BR> <BR>A theory might be that if you get Master rank on an  <BR>odd year, you keep getting them.  I got a Master Rank  <BR>in year sixty five, and I still get them.

 My theory on it, actually, is how often you do buying. In my present game, I went from C-class to Master class, all in one monster. Needless to say, I was doing multiple buyings of mint leaves and nuts oils. Particularly since my inventory was completely full of things to create other monsters with &#40;like the fire feather, the spear, the glue, and the sheath&#41; as well as a chunk of ice. Thus, I was buying every two weeks or so. Auntie never started getting sales, once I was buying this often. <BR> <BR>My first game, by the time I was buying mint leaves and nuts oils in bulk, I&#39;d already pretty much emptied my inventory, as well as built my house to the largest size. Plus, I was only buying for using two items a month regularly, instead of three &#40;or four, in some cases&#41;. In other words, I went for six or seven weeks between buying, which allowed Auntie to have regular sales in between. <BR> <BR>Coincidence? Maybe she only makes the sales when she isn&#39;t making her quota of selling.

 I agree with torey...it may depend on that one question in the begining.  i think it went like this...&#34;Fourtually or unfourtually money sovles most of the world problems&#34; and it seems to make direct statement on money I&#39;m a master rank and still recieve sales...Has anybody reported not getting the erranty sale? I still get mine&#39;s. <BR> <BR>KAO&#39;KEN

 Or It could be the simple fact that you&#39;re sending them to the erranty or expeditions during the month the mails actullay comes in.  You notice how you may get a sales paper one week and then reset &#40;for your reason&#41; you still get the sales paper that same week when you reload.  this may put a theory in the air that the sales are set for a certain day or something like that or a pattern but the erranty sales seems to come on a random pattern because you can reload the 4th week and sometime&#39;s get it and sometime&#39;s don&#39;t? <BR>What do you guy&#39;s think about that idea? <BR> <BR>KAO&#39;KEN

 i don&#39;t think it can be the last idea, just because of my raising style.  in the 300 game years since i got my last sale, i have raised monsters for years without going on any errantry or expeditions.  yet when i used to get sales, i got at least one every two years.

 Besides, the papers come in at approximately the same time, but not exactly at the same time. They will tend to come in within a month of one another &#40;so if you reset, it may delay a day or something&#41;. The same with the cheap errantries &#40;which, by the way, have _not_ stopped coming&#41; <BR> <BR>It may be pure chance, but if that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s a wierd chance. And besides: what about the critters like my wracky, who didn&#39;t get sent on errantries for over two years?
