 This time, I&#39;m hoping to gather people&#39;s input on the best species- not just the best main-types, but specific creatures for the job.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found: <BR> <BR>Mock- High Intelligence and Life, plus some natural talent for the task. <BR> <BR>Gali/Plant- Statistically, one of the best possible monsters for the job.  High Power, Intelligence, Skill, and Life.  May not have the same &#34;luck&#34; factor as the others. <BR> <BR>ColorPandora/Pixie- The name says it all &#34;PeachTreeBug&#34;.  This one is an absolute natural for scrounging up 3 or 4 Gold Peaches per trip, and might even work for earning Silver ones, too. <BR> <BR>Suezo/Hare- Notice how its card says that it&#39;s a natural-born adventurer, and it loves exploring?  The MR2 cards are often much more than flavor text.  Power, Intelligence, and Skill are all easy to find on this monster, and even Life can be nudged up to a solid 300 without too much trouble.  The important thing here is the luck factor- these guys dig up tons of great stuff easily. <BR> <BR>Beaclon/Beaclon- The pure breed is also a natural-born digger, and while it doesn&#39;t have the Intelligence of the other guys I&#39;ve listed here, his natural luck factor will help you a lot.  A Tiger sub-breed would have better Intelligence, but I don&#39;t know about the effects on its digging ability, and the lifespan hit would definately be annoying...

 I tend to use a Suezo of some sort when I run low on Gold Peaches. Usually a purebred from the Market gets the job done. I noticed how you did put the Suezo/Hare in your list. All I care about when I do send a Suezo to expedition is High INT and decent LIF. That&#39;s usually enough to get the job done for me.

 Yeah, but a lot of people have theorized that Skill has something to do with success at finding things like the Joker Mask.  Also, the Power is good for clearing out obstacles.

 Add Stong Horn &#40;Golem/Beaclon&#41;to the list, Nate.  Dad used one before and it found three peaches on average, and once found four, or so he says.  It has good power, defense, intelligence and life, but poor skill, undoubtedly due to the Golem main-type.

 I&#39;ve never had any luck sending my Beaclons, oddly enough. Of course, that may just be my wierd luck. ^_- <BR> <BR>My big finders were Jill/Jill &#40;_the_ best of the bunch, by far!&#41; and a Dragon/Dragon &#40;who didn&#39;t have a ton of luck finding more than one gold peach at a time, but found plenty of saleable items to help make up for that.

 My best overall hunter has been a Dragon as well, in terms of pure ability to find things.  His  <BR>luck isn&#39;t the greatest, tho.  I&#39;m thinking maybe when I raise a Mocchi again &#42;shudder&#42; he  <BR>might be good... decent LIF, POW and INT, and we&#39;ve all seen their luck in battles... maybe it  <BR>carries over.  After all, the only mocchi I ever raised was my first monster, and he found the  <BR>Fire Feather on the first quest I ever went on. <BR> <BR>PezCat <BR> <BR>=^..^=   =^..^=   =^

 I am currently raising a rockworm &#40;Worm/Golem&#41; and l strongly suggest it to anyone,.  its life is at about 600 and its power is in the eighthundred range, but the funny thing is, its intelligence is only about 250, and it still found a gold peach on the first time it went to ParePare. now this got me thinking, if it finds one at 250, if I were able to raise it to about 400&#43;,.. what would it find????

 So far my best expedition monster has been a suezo/worm.  He has found the joker mask, old sheath, many disk ships, and at least 6 gold peaches.  Not to mention he has won 3 silver peaches for me in the elder&#39;s cup.  He is one of my best monsters ever, good old George~9!  He has over 700 int., 400 pow., and 400 life.  He was specifically raised for expeditions and just happened to live long enough to be an elder&#39;s cup winner.  Oh, and he is a first generation, straight off the disk monster.
