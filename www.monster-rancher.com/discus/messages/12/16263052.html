 I&#39;m still fairly new to expeditions in MR2&#40;having focused mostly on whomping the hell out of opponents&#41;, and am having problems finding anything.  Naturally, this is because most of my monsters are Pow-based and thus couldn&#39;t find their own butts in a fogbank Int-wise.  Sending a Beaclon to Torles let me find lots of items through sheer persistence alone, but they were all Disc Chips and Lump of Ice and such &#40;I WANT that glue, dammit&#41;. <BR> <BR>However, I&#39;m a little unnerved that obstacles seem to regenerate from year to year.  In MR1, it was pretty straightforward -- take a high-Pow monster through and stomp all the obstacles into the ground, then take a high-Int monster next year and get rich.  This time, I&#39;d seem to need a monster high in Pow &#40;to clear obstacles&#41; AND Int &#40;to find anything... AND Lif &#40;so it has enough energy to do anything before having to turn back&#41;.  There aren&#39;t too many that can do average-to-well in all three of those. <BR> <BR>What monster types have people had success with?  I haven&#39;t unlocked many of the hidden types yet &#40;part of the reason I&#39;m going on expeditions in the first place&#41; -- I&#39;ve gotten Mock, Ghost and Beaclon apart from the FIMBA Four and Golem/Baku.

 i had my best success with int based monsters - 700&#43; int seems to get good results.  most obstacles can be moved by a monster with 200&#43; pow. <BR>lif goes in 70 point increments - 210-279 gets you 210 life points on expedition; 280-349 gets you 280, etc. <BR> <BR>my best finders were a suezo specifically trained for the task, and a pure pixie who had 150 pow along with 350 lif.

 Most people I&#39;ve heard like to root &#40;pardon the pun&#41; for the Mock as best errantry critter. Myself, I found most of my thnigs with a Stripe Shell &#40;including hte big footprint and the joker mask&#41;. <BR> <BR>My biggest &#39;find&#39; critter after him has been my Jill, and I think dragons would work extremely well for the same reason: tons of power, tons of intelligence, and good life to fall back on. Phoenix are a good monster for it as well, if you&#39;ve got the fearther unlocked.  <BR> <BR>If you haven&#39;t got any of the monsters unlocked, I suggest, as Torey said, a suezo. They get good life gains to help with their intelligence. Pixies need the power &#40;at least 300 is good&#41; to keep up. <BR> <BR>As a note: I suggest that using Beaclon is a relatively bad idea, just because a lot of them are dumb as bricks. Persistance&#39;ll help, but to find a lot of the &#39;good&#39; stuff, you&#39;ll want the intelligence for better attacks. <BR> <BR>Oh, and as a note: before you get the glue, you have to have built the quack doll at least once. Just in case you haven&#39;t gotten that done, yet.

 Well, yes, the Beaclon was an idiot.  However, he was the only monster I had with &#62;300 life, and so he lasted long enough on expeditions to find _something_.  Just not much.   <BR> <BR>I got Gonzalez from a Sueki Suezo sacrifice, took one look at his stats and said ACK!  Mixing him with a well-trained Ape produced a pure Mock with decent numbers that just found me the Glue -- he&#39;s pretty hopeless for combat &#40;speed and skill go up at pitiful rates&#41;, but seems reasonably good for exploration right now &#40;age 2, 680 Int, 200 Pow, 280 Lif&#41;. <BR> <BR>Next up: Fire Feather.  I hope.

 If you&#39;re raising it purely for expeditions, I&#39;d suggest Dragon, myself.  But that&#39;s me.  Dragon  <BR>POW and INT goes up real quick, and LIF is decent, so you&#39;ll have the time.  I had one Dragon  <BR>&#40;actally, I think he was the Dodongo &#91;Dragon/Bajarl&#93; that I trained&#41; that cleaned out 5  <BR>buildings and had time to spare when I brought him back in from the Jungle. <BR> <BR>Mocks aren&#39;t bad if you can get their life up, but I just detest those friggin&#39; trees... <BR> <BR>PezCat <BR> <BR>=^..^=   =^..^=    =^..^= <BR>=^..^=   =^..^=    =^..^= <BR>=^..^=   =^..^=    =^.

 Actually, Beaclons seem to be fairly lucky at finding items, from what I&#39;ve gathered.  If Intelligence is a problem, just get it a Henger or Tiger sub-type.  Worms, Zuums, and Mocks also seem to be natural-born hunters.  Finally, I once saw someone suggest a Gali/Worm, since the Gali main-type would give it high Power, Intelligence, and Skill, and the Worm sub-type would give it extra Life and lifespan.  Seemed to be a pretty good suggestion to me.

 My preference is towards pixies.  Where on  <BR>expiditions INT seems to be so vital, my first  <BR>generation pixie was at 500 before I &#34;retired&#34; it,  <BR>well, combined to create a second generation. <BR> <BR>My question is more specifically towards Torey  <BR>Luvullo.  You say that a pixie you raised had like  <BR>350 LIF or more.  I&#39;ve gotten to that point, but  <BR>by than she&#39;s prettymuch ready to die.  And after  <BR>combination the life is below 100 again.  DO you  <BR>have a secret. <BR> <BR>Anyways

 i like the pixies too, james.  nope, no secrets, just a lot of pixies raised and combined.  for a story about lisl, the 350 lif pixie, and how she became the &#39;mother&#39; of another pixie who ended up with 321 lif, read the thread called &#34;time out for super pixie&#34; in the july 2000 topics in the cafe.  my method is basic.  i max out the pixie in her three favorite categories, int, ski and spd, then i use excess int on perpetual swim drills for the rest of her life. <BR> <BR>btw, this is by no means the highest accomplishment of pixie stats, even on this board.  3 people off the top of my head i remember as having pixies with higher lif - sct, eagle fierce and pixiemaster all had pixies with better lif than either iris or lisl. &#91;probably more that i dont remember too&#93;.  maybe they will add to this thread and give a little more help in that noblest of endeavors:  &#34;the raising of a pixie!&#34;

 My expedition monster is a tiger/tiger. It has gotten me everything needed to unlock monsters and is still supplying me with Golden Peaches.

 Phoenix for me since I always max out Int. and get ski.&#40;ok skill has nothing to do with expeditions right?&#41; and lif. Power on my phoenixes is usually about 300, quite enough with the high lif. be seein&#39; ya

 im not sure its been proven one way or the other the effect of skill on expeditions, p.m. - ive sure seen plenty of posts by people i respect saying it seems to them that skill has something to do. <BR> <BR>i cant prove it one way or another, because its been so long since i sent a monster on expedition who had high int and low ski.  lately, all my peachfinders have been high in both.
