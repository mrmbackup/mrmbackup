<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
My investigation first started when I saw people saying that sharking a monster is not the same as doing the actual CD.  <BR> <BR>Now, maybe I am wrong but so far using 2 theories  <BR>said by Lisa and Dark Phoenix I have found the CD  <BR>and sharked version to be the same.  <BR> <BR>1. Lisa stated in a post that sharking a monster  <BR>only changes its appearance while keeping the  <BR>previous monsters guts, stat gains, and stat  <BR>multipliers the same. While this is true if the  <BR>code is used on a preexisting monster, I believe  <BR>it is not true if used when you do not have a  <BR>monster out and you go to the shrine and insert  <BR>any CD of your choice. To test it, I simply got a   <BR>mocchi straight off the MR2 disc and froze it and  <BR>saved with no monster out. I then turned on the  <BR>monster editor code to a Serenity &#40;Pixie/Plant&#41;.  <BR>Once again I went to the shrine and just kept the  <BR>MR2 disc in and obviously got a Serenity from it.  <BR>I immediately froze her, saved, then went to Vs.  <BR>mode. At first glance it was obvious that  <BR>Serenity&#39;s guts regain was far faster than mocchis  <BR>and got to 99 long before mocchi&#39;s did. This  <BR>disproves the theory that all the technicalities  <BR>of the monster will remain the same as the  <BR>original monster.&#40;Granted you must use the code  <BR>when getting the monster off a CD, not on a frozen  <BR>monster or one already on the farm.&#41;  <BR> <BR>2. Dark Phoenix&#39;s theory on combining &#40;which has  <BR>never failed me&#41; was the second tested theory on  <BR>CD vs. sharking monsters. First, I found mocchis  <BR>multipliers 3,3,3,4,4,4. Keeping these in mind I  <BR>looked for 2 monsters with multipliers that were  <BR>pretty different from mocchis. I already had a  <BR>trained zuum in my freezer so I used him. Using  <BR>the shark code for a Jell/Golem, I made one using  <BR>the MR2 disc again. Now if the sharked Jell  <BR>stat multipliers were not the same as the  <BR>original Jell&#39;s straight off a CD that would  <BR>normally produce him and were identical to that of  <BR>the Mocchi that one would normally get off the MR2  <BR>disc I sharked, then once I fixed Jell&#39;s stats to  <BR>match zuum&#39;s stats the combination would not be  <BR>great. However, once fixing Jells stats to fix  <BR>Zuum&#39;s stats:  <BR>Zuum  <BR>Life - 201&#40;3&#41; x1 = 201  <BR>Power - 600&#40;3&#41; x1 = 600  <BR>Int - 630&#40;2&#41; x0.5 = 315  <BR>Ski - 999&#40;4&#41; x1.5 = 999  <BR>Spd - 304&#40;3&#41; x1 = 304  <BR>Def - 100&#40;3&#41; x1 = 100  <BR> <BR>Jell  <BR>Life - 201&#40;3&#41; x1 = 201  <BR>Power- 600&#40;3&#41; x1 = 600  <BR>Int - 210&#40;4&#41; x1.5 = 315  <BR>Ski- 999&#40;3&#41; x1 = 999  <BR>Spd- 608&#40;2&#41; x0.5 = 304  <BR>Def - 67&#40;4&#41; x1.5 = 101  <BR>&#42;Keep in mind the stats don&#39;t have to be EXACTLY  <BR>the same. Just the same level.  <BR> <BR>Dadge told me I had a great combination. So far  <BR>it&#39;s holding up. So, to make sure it wasn&#39;t  <BR>mocchi&#39;s multipliers that Jell/Golem used we kept  <BR>the same stats that Jell/Golem had, and combined  <BR>Zuum and Mocchi.  <BR> <BR>Mocchi  <BR>Life - 201&#40;3&#41; x1 = 201  <BR>Power - 600&#40;3&#41; x1 = 600  <BR>Int - 210&#40;3&#41; x1 = 210  <BR>Ski - 999&#40;4&#41; x1.5 = 999  <BR>Spd - 608&#40;4&#41; x1.5 = 912  <BR>Def - 67&#40;4&#41; x1.5 = 101  <BR> <BR>NO SIR! Dadge did not tell me I had a great  <BR>combination.  <BR> <BR>So, as you can see, the sharked Jell/Golem has the  <BR>same stat multipliers as the one you would  <BR>actually find on the CD that produces him. And as  <BR>for technicalities such as guts, the sharked  <BR>Serenity was clearly faster than the mocchi that  <BR>would have been produced if not for the sharking. <BR> <BR>So in conclusion, from my experiments, yes it is  <BR>possible to get the ACTUAL monster you want by  <BR>sharking, and not a monster that looks like the  <BR>one your sharking but actually has different  <BR>stats. You do not need to buy the CDs or make them  <BR>with a program, you can simply shark them. <BR> <BR>If anyone has already proven this here on the site  <BR>I apologize for restating it. <BR> <BR>If anyone has any other questions regarding  <BR>anything in the game, please ask and I will try to  <BR>test them out, whether it requires sharking or  <BR>not. I am here to help! <BR> <BR>PS - I will try to start making a MR2 video series  <BR>on youtube that shows the various training methods  <BR>listed on this site so you can have a visual on  <BR>how to do them.

 That looks pretty good, actually. I think where things get weird is when people try to make the types that don&#39;t really exist in the game, like a few of the opponents in-game appear to be of subs that don&#39;t exist for that monster main type.

 Thanks so much Lisa, I am happy to provide information to  <BR>give us all a better understanding of things. <BR> <BR>Also, I am thinking about testing enemies in order to see if  <BR>they have their own stats or if they are merely another breed  <BR>with a different look. <BR> <BR>Finally, I do imagine that when people mess around with  <BR>monsters that don&#39;t actually exist that things would get weird.  <BR>So I am not very concerned with those monsters, just real  <BR>ones. <BR> <BR>If you feel that this is valid proof and you would like to move it  <BR>into a more &#34;accepted info about the game&#34; section, please do.  <BR>This is the only place I could post at, so that&#39;s why it&#39;s here.
