 Okay, so I raised, ummm...  one Naga.  And, uhh...  I did poorly at it.  Well, this topic is lonely, okay?! <BR> <BR>Actually, I raised TWO nagas.  The first one I got most of my info from, a Striker &#40;Naga/Tiger&#41;.  Let me say this - Nagas are one of the COOLEST-looking breeds in the game!  Okay, said it.  Now... <BR> <BR>Nagas have a lot of potential.  I say this because of Susvain.  Susvain was always my nemesis for...  what is he, B Rank?  C rank?  Whichever, he&#39;s a Naga/Zuum whose stats were usually all higher or close to whatever I had except for intelligence.  &#40;When I got my Golems going, their Power usually beat out Susvain&#39;s, but other than that, they usually beat most of their stats&#41;.  Nagas are terribly well-rounded, it seems.  Their only weakness is low Intelligence, but that doesn&#39;t come into play much - their Int attacks are usually just used for Withering, and if you have a good sub-breed, like Tiger &#40;hehe&#41;, you&#39;ll thwomp &#39;em in no time. <BR> <BR>Power and Skill are their best stats, I think.  Power is very important because, without it, you&#39;ll have a hard time beating monsters.  It&#39;s wonderful to have a high-skill monster, which I&#39;m starting to miss after those Golems and Durahans.  Sure, there are freak accidents &#40;How the &amp;^%#&#42;@^$&#42;$&amp;@$ did Rockgeiger dodge three Stabs in a row?!?!&#41;, but overall, they work well.  They&#39;re NOT one-hit-wonders, and I wouldn&#39;t count on Speed Demon or Tank &#40;although sub-breeds would help with either&#41;, but they are good at...  ummm...  well, I always used Desperation, but I think Combo King would work better, now that I think about it.  I think the guts regen was about average, and the attacks tended to be quick, low damage attacks rather than drawn-out pummeling attacks. <BR> <BR>As for life on the farm...  well, I imagine most breeds would be living hell to raise.  The Tiger sub-breed helped out a LOT, and I got a friendly creature with Best nature who was actually funny to watch &#40;have you seen their happy dance?  HA HA HA!!!&#41;.  Train power and skill primarily, then either speed or defense depending on the sub-breed.  Only train intelligence if you have an agreeable sub. <BR> <BR>Oh, and the other Naga I trained?  Well, Nagas have short lifespans.  I wanted to get a Mock without &#34;wasting&#34; a monster.  I had a Purple Suezo on a disc that I combined with something, and I lucked out and got a pure Naga.  I was horrible to him.  He was full-grown in a few months, with the amount of lifespan I was shaving off of him.  I think that was the first time I ever saw &#34;Truancy&#34;. <BR> <BR>I was re-introduced to the power of a Naga&#39;s gains.  I mainly put him through the Power Errantry and Endure drills &#40;Endure because it looks the most painful, plus Swim drills occaisonally&#41;.  I put him in a tournament to have KO&#39;s shave more life off of him.  He won them.  Whoa. <BR> <BR>Consider this a sample review before Nate gets around to reviewing these.  Y&#39;know, and does a GOOD job of it? <BR> <BR>Man, I&#39;m bored....  Ciao.

 Freak accidents, my butt!  I&#39;m convinced that Rockgieger has a &#42;much&#42; higher SPD than the 25 or so the game claims he has.  Against monsters with SKI in the 200-300 range, he dodges roughly 3 times out of any 4 given attacks!! <BR> <BR>Maybe a little hint from our friends at Tecmo not to take everything you read at face value..?

 I think certain types of monsters have a factor of &#34;luck&#34; as golems seem to dodge a lot. I&#39;ve bene meaning to start a thread about this, but I just haven&#39;t gotten around to it yet.

 How do you guys keep the Nagas out of Fond??  I do exactly like I do with every other monster, and when I do FINALLY get a naga out of Fond, I&#39;ll rest them on the week their due or do weight maintence&#40;sp?&#41; and the next thing I know, I&#39;m back at Fond!  If this will help, I usually do three light and a rest during their baby to childhood until I get to prime and then switch to 4th week HD food 1st week LD 2nd week NO and HD and 3rd week ML and rest... what am I doing wrong with these bipedal snakes?

 When I get soft or fond, I use Smoked Snakes. I won&#39;t tolerate a soft style monster.
