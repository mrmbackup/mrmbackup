How do I get my fame to skyrocket? Since the answer is win battles, how do I win enough battles? The highest my fame has ever been was 31. I need Help with a capital &#34;H&#34;  <BR> <BR>-- JellTrainer &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lukadjukic@yahoo.com">lukadjukic@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000  <BR> <BR>I can even help you with this one. Win a lot of tournaments. Losing will only decrease your fame. I&#39;m pretty sure K.O.s help more as well. If a monster withdraws from a match I think it doesn&#39;t go up, because when I was going for my IMa E one time 3 backed out then I went 1-1 and I went down in fame. So win lots of tourneys and don&#39;t lose!!!!!  <BR> <BR>-- John Johnson &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ltdoesntmatterwhatmynameis@yahoo.com">ltdoesntmatterwhatmynameis@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Save before each battle, if you lose, reload. If you don&#39;t lose a match you won&#39;t lose fame. Also you can use the Star Fruit. It increases fame by 20. <BR> <BR>-- Kilroy &#40;<A HREF="mailto:iamtwinkiethekid@hotmail.com">iamtwinkiethekid@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Stay in E class tournaments for a couple of years. Also you can use star prunes they increase fame by 20  <BR> <BR>-- tjmax &#40;<A HREF="mailto:tjmax@tnweb.com">tjmax@tnweb.com</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Fame isn&#39; so important that you need to worry. Use Star Prunes and do well in fights.  <BR> <BR>-- Francisco Rodriguez &#40;<A HREF="mailto:amrodrig@flash.net">amrodrig@flash.net</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I have found out what fame is mostly from, due to the consequences my friend got when making his monster with 999 on all stats. When all the monsters didn&#39;t want to fight him, he didn&#39;t get any fame! Even with a star prune.  <BR>-- Lord Balon &#40;<A HREF="mailto:foxxnet@worldnet.att.net">foxxnet@worldnet.att.net</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Oh! I also forgot that my friend obviously used gameshark to make all his stats 999. But I just wanted to mention that just in case, because it is possible to have a newborn with ridiculously high stats but it probably take a very long time to accomplish that.  <BR> <BR>-- Lord Balon &#40;<A HREF="mailto:foxxnet@worldnet.att.net">foxxnet@worldnet.att.net</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Fame can be obtained in 2 ways:  <BR>1&#41; star prune. Added fame = 20pts.  <BR>2&#41; battling. If you participate in a tourney, you get a fame modification with range of &#40;-20, 20&#41;. Each battle will get you a set number of fame pts each. The number depend on whether you lose, win, KO, or get KO&#39;ed. I don&#39;t know the actual number of points gained for each case though. The numbers change if you participate in a rank that is different than yours &#40;at the moment&#41;.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I cant believe people can&#39;t give a straight answer here. To get high fame, fight only the unofficial tournaments that won&#39;t raise your monsters rank until your monster is strong enough to beat the next level battles. If you fight in tournaments below your monster&#39;s class, its fame will always lower. Or if you lose or whatever, your fame will lower.  <BR> <BR>-- KEjO &#40;<A HREF="mailto:kejo_thefirst@hotmail.com">kejo_thefirst@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>quoting the manual a good way to raise it quick without the fruit is to win against big enemies that you have a hard time with&#40;sleetbomb&#41; also KOs might boost fame a little  <BR> <BR>-- Zuumsaurian &#40;<A HREF="mailto:b_hagstrom@hotmail.com">b_hagstrom@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>One way to get higher starting fame is to combine monsters with a mocchi disk chip. This will give you 50 starting fame.  <BR> <BR>-- Miss Carrie &#40;<A HREF="mailto:musicality1@earthlink.net">musicality1@earthlink.net</A>&#41;, January 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR>You could give them starprunes every now and then. But it will cost you $1,000. Also, during battles you need to KO or win by alot when the battle is over with every single match. That will make your fame go up even more!  <BR> <BR>-- Bealcon &#40;<A HREF="mailto:---@---.com">---@---.com</A>&#41;, February 10, 2000.  <BR> <BR>EASY ANSWER!! When it goes on a sale at the marked go there and you can buy star prunes for 800g.&#40;it is still kinda expensive though&#41; anyway every time you give a monster a starprune his loyalty will go up by 20! Remember if you go in a lower grade tourney than your monsters rank, his fame will drop!  <BR> <BR>-- Hare Master &#40;?@?.ca&#41;, March 23, 2000.
