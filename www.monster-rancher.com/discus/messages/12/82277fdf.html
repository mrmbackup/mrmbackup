 Ok I want to conduct an experiment. If anyone has done this before &#40;like the person who sent apes to find him&#41; I want to conduct an experiment where I send a monster &#40;I want to get your opinions on the monster to use&#41; of each rank, and the same date, each time to the INT errantry. Each monster will have stats according to rank. I will send each monster 30 times and write down my results. I wanted to get your opinions on this before I do though.

 Heres an update so far... <BR> <BR>I have decided to raise 6 ranks of Apes.

 An Idea just popped in my head. Maybe if we get a group of volenteers going, then we can cover more breeds in order to find him. Because I am very doubtful that this will find him because torey already explained that someone had tested the ape thing. I just wanted to retest it using this method, and maybe a couple of volenteers would like to do it also. Using different breeds.

 Ok, but I just noticed that an E-class stat ape, does not get past the final part of the errantry. I have raised his INT for 1 yr 9 month, to 126 and he does not pass it. &#40;It was pretty darn hard to get it that high&#41;. Even if he did pass it, chances are low to find him. So, I decided to not train E, D, or C class do to low stats. Usually to unlock a monster it would be B-class anyway. <BR> <BR>To mepersoner, if we find this Ape, you will be part of the amazingly, honorable, hero team that found this Ape. <BR> <BR>&#40;On the US version that is&#41;

 What I meant by that is, that the Mock Seeds are gotten by rank and fame. But maybe to find King Ape it is a Certain Date, so that is why I&#39;m sending each rank of Ape to the Errantry on the same date, but not the same year.

Ok here is a current update on the project: <BR> <BR>Slapshotz64 has helped me out with this and is still doing some more. I have the results for my B-class Ape and Slapshotz sent his C-class Pixie. Here are the Results for my Ape B-Class: <BR> <BR>ALSO: All of the Apes  being used will be sent to the errantry on April 1st wk. <BR> <BR>STATS: 409,407,229,458,274,366 <BR>NATURE: Good <BR># of attacks: 6 <BR> <BR>NOTES: <BR>All of this was done in first and second stage, so he did not use any peaches. I think that these stats are B-class, or just about. <BR><B>ERRANTRY RESULTS:</B> <BR> <BR>Here are the errantry results after being sent to the errantry 30 times. <BR> <BR>ORDER: Name/Type/Amount seen <BR> <BR>No Battle x 4 <BR>Ambusher - Ape x 4 <BR>Blower - Gaboo x 3 <BR>Huntie - Zuum x 3 <BR>Executioner - Plant x 2 <BR>Fly Trapper - Plant x 4 <BR>Clear Lizard - Zuum x 3 <BR>Mire - Gaboo x 2 <BR>Mad Clay&#40;Gaboo&#41; - Gaboo x 5 <BR> <BR>Here are <B>Slapshotz64&#39;s</B> Pixie results: <BR> <BR>He raised a Pixie, C class and sent it 30 times: <BR> <BR>Executioner - Plant x 5 <BR>Fly trapper - Plant x 5 <BR>Clear Lizard - Zuum x 4 <BR>Blower - Gaboo x 3 <BR>Mire - Gaboo x 3 <BR>Ambusher - Ape x 1 <BR>Stinky - Ape x 1 <BR>Spring Legs x 1 <BR>No Battle x 7 <BR> <BR>Well, there was no luck so far. But as you can see, the results are quite a bit different. I had the Mad Gaboo a bunch of times and while Slapshotz with his C monster did not. Maybe rank does make a difference in things like the errantry. Well, I will be posting A-Class Ape probably tommorow. &#40;These things are a pain to train&#41;.

 Sorry for the delay. I have been caught up in other things and I&#39;m trying to get some money to train these Apes.  <BR> <BR>I wanted to mention that King Ape is probably just a glitch in MR2. I found out in chat that Lisa even got to ask the Japanese a question about him, and they said he does not exist.

 Actually, while I did send email about him, I never received a reply. And, before a bunch of other people get the idea to ask, remember that I was allowed by Tecmo US to send one letter via their translator, directly to the programmers, where I asked about King Ape, Resistance, and the all 25s Monol. This was about a year ago. Other inquiries to the Japanese have taken less time &#40;MR3 battle sense&#41;, and some have taken longer &#40;God&#39;s Slate&#41;. One day they may reply, but at this point, due to the nature of this issue, I doubt it. <BR> <BR>The fact is, once a game ships, the developers don&#39;t spend time playing it to death. They have other games to move on to making. They have no incentive to figure out why a particular enemy monster is somehow not available due to a bug in the software.

 Okay, this may be a little late but I encountered King Ape the second time I went on the errantry. I think you have to have an S Class monster &#40;especially if you want to beat him&#41; to find him. Just keep trying and he will show up eventually. If you beat him, you&#39;ll get his card. If this helps I used a ColorPandora.

 Sorry for the short reply. I was doing something. Anyway, this is quite interesting, but as you can see some others have posted that they have seen him too. Now I have started sending my S-Class Ape &#40;Maxxed&#41; to the errantry about 8 times so far and no luck. And probably after my 22 more tries I will find no luck. King Ape might as well be a Myth in the US version.  <BR> <BR>Also, maybe if people took his stats down or something it would help. Descriptions on what he looks like and things like that are already known. Stats and things like that are&#39;nt. <BR> <BR>And are you sure you saw King Ape? I believe that there are 3 kinds of Apes in that errantry &#40;4 including King Ape&#41;. Just making sure you saw him.

 just in case anyone is trying to convince me, i place no credence in people&#39;s descriptions of past encounters with the royal simian.  memory just cannot be trusted.  i would need to see someone going out to look for him, finding him, and giving a detailed account of the encounter, at the very least.

 Good luck on finding the ellusive ape.  After this week, I will try searching for him to help you all out.  If I remember, you do not like screenshots because those can be faked, correct?  What kind of proof, aside from stats, would be worthy of credibility?

 Yeah, as long as they aren&#39;t anything like the mega-cards, you&#39;ll be fine. The basic 15 block cards are pretty stable. They all wear out eventually, so I strongly recommend buying a few for future use. In 2-3 years you won&#39;t be seeing these things in stores any more.

 If it helps any, i tried looking for king ape a while ago. I saw somewhere that you need to have a monster under 1 yr 6 mos, and i decided to raise a gold dust &#40;Ape/???&#41; thinking that by using one Ape/???, i could find the other &#40;Sort of a monkey see, monkey do type thing&#41; and after about 30-40 battles with a B class ape at 1 yr, 5 mos, i found nothing. I know its possible to encounter S-Class monsters with this guy, because i fought a blue phoenix in kawrea. Anyway, i just wanted to say i tried that, and found nothing <BR>And animatrix, what version of the game are you using? USA, or PAL?

 Can&#39;t there be different kinds/pressings of the US monster rancher? To where some people on their pressing have the King and the others with another pressing can&#39;t encounter him, no matter how hard they try.

 No. Because that would imply that the software was re-written, and then things like gameshark codes wouldn&#39;t work on everyone&#39;s copy, and memory locations for hacking would be in different places. All of those things are consistent every time. <BR> <BR>It would also mean sending a new master to the Sony factory, and incredibly expensive process. <BR> <BR>Tecmo never went back and re-wrote the game, they moved onto other projects. They produce a lot of games every year. And, it&#39;s simply not economically feasible to spend the money on salaries and pressing costs. <BR> <BR>No one even started talking about not seeing King Ape until Dark Phoenix started working on finding him about a year ago. It&#39;s not like an outright bug in the game, like the swim bug, or the double lifespan hit at errantry, or the inability to get certain techs. One would think that if Tecmo spent an extra couple hundred thousand dollars re-working the game, that they&#39;d fix those far more obvious bugs.

 Sorry for the long time away; I have had finals to deal with.  I have started a new game just for the heck of it and am currently raising a Reggae Plant for the job of searching for the King Ape.  I also bought a new card so that I can send it in to prove that it wasnt tampered with.

 Well, I guess Animatrix is still looking, but besides that, I don&#39;t think anyone else is, and for me, I give up. I&#39;ve tried looking and from other past info on Ape, it all turned out bad. Sure there have been some sightings, but not provable. I mean, Lisa has asked the makers of the game, DP tried searching for months, sharking monsters, sharking anything, just to try to find him. You know, I just don&#39;t think its possible. I&#39;m going on now as thinking of King Ape as a Myth. Unless Animatrix here can prove me different.....

 May I postulate a theory? <BR> <BR>I noticed in my experiments that each of the other S class errantry opponents only appeared after a certain events have occured in the game.  Each Class S opponent appears to be unlocked by what I call &#34;trigger events&#34;.  According to my info, the trigger events for the other Class S errantry monsters are as follows: <BR> <BR>Sniper - Finding the Spear in the Mandy Desert Errantry. <BR>Jill - Finding the Big Footstep on the Torles Expedition. <BR>Zilla King - Digging up the Hot Springs using a Hopper <BR>Blue Phoenix - Kawrea Volcano Eruption <BR> <BR>According to this pattern, the King Ape should have a <BR>&#34;trigger event&#34; as well.  My theory is that King Ape&#39;s <BR>appearance is triggered by an event that is linked to the Pocketstation game.  However, the Pocketstation game was deleted, so....

 Sorry guys, I actually stopped searching.  I just got a hold of a copy of FF7 for the first time and, you know, I forgot about MR2 entirely.  It seems that noone has found the dang Ape yet, so im guessing this thread is gonna be closed soon.  You can bet that if anyone finds the elusive ape, then he will be posted in detail.

 Sorry about the double posting, but I just noticed that torey had the card info on king ape.  If I remember correctly, the only way to get a card is to battle the monster on the errantry &#40;win or lose&#41;.  Doesnt that mean he at one time fought king ape, or perhaps someone in his family did without his knowing.

 And you don&#39;t have to encounter King Ape really, you just use Gameshark for all the cards.  <BR> <BR>And DP, you got a good point, and like Strunks said, all of us have beat and completed the game to the point where it gets boring and you have all the breeds unlucked. And I to think that it was related to the pocketstation. Someone with the other version of MR2, can test and find King Ape because Lisa said that some people playing the UK/Pal version, have said to have seen the Ape. But if it was true, thats another story.

 Nathaniel, you DO notice that it&#39;s a &#34;Canada Olympic Team Jacket&#34; that the Ape has on in that pic you found... <BR>I&#39;m starting to doubt that this is true since there have been NO references to existing real-life countries in this whole series. <BR> <BR>The only thing credible is a color sheme never used for an ape. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the last little bit, the background for your monster seems like the wrong place, it looks like it&#39;s in the mountainous areas, not the Parepare jungle areas. <BR> <BR>I can safely say that it&#39;s not a card since they always have a hand-drawn look.  This one looks pixelized so it SHOULD be from the game during perhaps a battle.

 WHT Junior&#39;s site has the real picture. You can use a gameshark to place all the cards into your game. You can also use some image extraction software to see the pics on the game disc as well. The pic is genuine.

 Nathaniel got the pic off of WHT-Juniors site Lance. This is the actual card pic. I used gameshark just to check all of the cards, and this is the actual card pic.

 And another encounter with absolutely no proof. But so far the people encountering, have monsters at B-Class. I used a B-Class Stat monster in my experiment, but I got no results after several times. I just don&#39;t know, but as I said, so far noone has any proof, and I don&#39;t think we can even consider actually posting actual info on the Ape until we got some hard evidence. Descriptions just won&#39;t do any more, cause we all just know just about what he looks like. <BR> <BR>Please anyone reading this thread, please know, this is a very important enemy, and getting some proof would be nice. <BR> <BR>But although, I&#39;m still sticking to the idea of him just being taken out with Pocketstation.

 well, there is &#34;proof&#34;, then there is &#34;proof&#34;.  the best form of proof is to figure out what you did to make him show up, then let everyone know, so that they can make him show up too.  any lesser form of proof is debatable, and not as useful.

 Kio, lemme say that you are the first person to provide any information about this monster.  Because of this you have the advantage that we know very little about the monster &#40;other than what it looks like, which you are correct about&#41;. <BR> <BR>Really, you could&#39;ve made this info up, which some people may claim, do not get disheartened. <BR> <BR>Some questions, do you use a gameshark?  Were there any events leading up to the discovery of King Ape?  Is there ANY info you can provide to us on how we can find the King Ape? <BR> <BR>The minute someone with some backing to their name finds the King Ape too, using your methods, you&#39;re in the clear.  <BR> <BR>Until then, expect a little bit of skepticism. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m skeptical myself, but I will believe you more than I&#39;ve believed anyone before, because you posted some actual info.  It&#39;s just I&#39;m sure that info is available online somewhere, like  Japanese MR site. <BR> <BR>But I have no idea, so good job Kio and good luck on proving it to the community.  You&#39;re already one step further than every other newb.  So maybe, just maybe, we all should have little faith in you. <BR> <BR>So, here, I have faith in you.... <BR> <BR>Now go figure out how you did it.

 Kio, are you new to this board?

I&#39;d say the only real proof here is to find out how you found and what the trigger is, post your method of raising the monster that you found him with, and post it on this site so we can all try it. Due to the volatility of this statement, I won&#39;t believe it until ive seen it with my own eyes.

 Yes, I&#39;m new. I&#39;ve tried re-loading my game from the same spot, and I haven&#39;t been able to get results.  I have no clue what the trigger is.  Maybe it&#39;s random? I don&#39;t know.  In awhile, though, I&#39;ll find someone with a scanner.  I took a picture of the screen with a disposable camera when I first found king ape, so when the film is developed, I&#39;ll find a buddy to scan it for me and I&#39;ll post it.  My method of raising it, though is freestyle.  I just focused on raising his power with light drills.  His intelligence got high as I sent him on errantries to look for king ape.  I didn&#39;t feed him any items, but I had a lump of ice, and a Gemini&#39;s pot in my inventory.  I rested him whenever Colt said &#34;He seems well&#34;.  Battles were just to make money to send him on the errantries.  Also he battled to raise his rank to B, because all the reports of King Ape have been made with a B Class monster.  So once I got him up to Grade B, I did nothing but send him on errantries to search for King Ape.  When he asked for an item, I gave it to him half the time, and I fed him on milk until he got past 6 months, which he liked, and after, it was nothing but cup jellies, which he had no reaction to.  I sent him on all the expeditions he was invited to.

 A Screen Shot would be nice. I&#39;ve searched over and over again, using Gameshark, or not using gameshark. Are you sure your using the US Version. I know DP has done some really, really, good reasearch on him. Hacking the game and things like that. But you are the first to suply info, and good work.

 So far, only a about 3 people playing the US version have ever claimed to have seen it. And 2 of them have done so in this thread, both right after coming to the site. Thousands of other players, all with hundreds of years of gameplay under their belts, have never seen it. Several people, like DP, have spent hundreds of game years searching for King Ape in an organized manner. DP even tried to hack the game to trigger the event. And, while he could trigger other enemies, he could not trigger King Ape. <BR> <BR>Like other extremely rare/impossible occurences some types of new players are drawn to post about them to attempt to establish themselves as &#39;special&#39; on the site. Just remeber that we are looking fo reproducable results, not memories of things from weeks gone by.

 Is there any way to edit the stats and stuff of a monster to match that of mine?  If there is, please try it and see if it works.  I may have just gotten lucky twice.  &#40;Highly unlikely, but please consider the possibility&#41;.  I would have nothing to gain from posting false info except a serious kick in the behind from everyone on this site, and I don&#39;t want that.  And as for the contradicting statements, those were two different saved games.  I found him once, and my cousin deleted my game, I restarted my game and somehow found him again.  But please, consider the possibility.  I&#39;ll post nothing more on this subject until I find something or until my pictures are developed.

 the reason i said &#34;pictures won&#39;t do it for me&#34; is because screenshots can be faked and/or edited, or so it is stated in the &#34;golem man&#34; post about the 23 yr. old golem. So if you can post the method and we all can find him, then i will whole heartedly believe you. <BR> <BR>&#40;remember the &#34;screen shot&#34; of king ape from nathaniel zdanowicz was a pic of the card that is easily accesible by gameshark?&#41; <BR> <BR>This is turning out to be another &#34;23 yr. old golem&#34; or &#34;year of king ape.&#34;

 Try this, it may work.  &#40;Maybe&#41;.  Raise an ape breed to between three and four years old.  Have it&#39;s power be between 400 and 450.  Have it&#39;s life between 350 and 400.  Have all it&#39;s other stats less than that &#40;except maybe int. when I found it, it&#39;s int. raised from 397 which was when I sent it, to 416, which was when I fought it&#41;. Send it on an int. errantry on the fourth week of march.  Have its fame at 100.  When you send it, it&#39;s int. will level up, but it won&#39;t gain a technique.  It may take several resets, but you may find it.  I think it&#39;s random to a certain extent. <BR> <BR>If it doesn&#39;t work, then I&#39;ll stop trying.

 Ths reminds me of Kimeramon in Digimon World 2. People weren&#39;t happy cause he is so hard to get. The reason being you only have a 1 in 666 chance of seeing him in the 99th floor of Tera Domain.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps this thing with the King Ape is similar but then since this game has been pretty much well covered somebody would have noticed it when hacking into the game.

 Kio, did Errow warn you of the King Ape just like the King Zilla event? The other events there is an &#34;event&#34; that happens or you have to do something to see them.  If there&#39;s no warning or way to get him there...that&#39;s odd.

 He gave me no warning at all.  I know he gives you a warning for Bighands, and Zilla, but not for King Ape.  I sent Tropical Ape numerous times from the same week, same month, same year exactly the same and only encountered him a few times from that save file.

 you found him a few times from the same save file?!?!?!? Then that almost rules out the chance of it being random, unless you&#39;re like the guy who won the lottery 6 times. And i refuse to try things that you aren&#39;t sure of. make sure that works and then well try it.

 First let me apologize to Kio for being so skeptical.  I have been able to duplicate his results and have found King Ape.  Stats are as he indicated, 856/688/192/414/456/577.  I did this with a new game I had started about a week ago.  My first monster, Jethro, a Gibberer &#40;Ape/Hare&#41; was raised using the mango method with the extra mangos removed.  HD/LD/LD/RT, -/-/GO/ML, cup jelly, fighting for cash when necessary.  I sent him to the parepare errantry on the 4th week of Feb, 1007.  It took me 9 attempts from this saved position to get King Ape to show.  Jethro was 6yr, 10mo.  He is an S class monster, having won 3 of the final 4.  I did not go on any expeditions, and there was no special warning by Errow.  If I had to guess, I would say the key may be that both Kio and I used sub breeds of Ape.  I have several digital photos I took with my camera and will gladly email them to whoever I need to.

 The reason my sighting is so close in time to Kio&#39;s is that I decided to try and duplicate his results.  Otherwise I would probably never have done so.  Anybody else should be able to spot him too.  Start a new game, and raise any ape breed.  Get him to at least class B.  Both Kio and I had 100 fame, but I don&#39;t think that is a requirement.  Then keep trying the parepare errantry from the same saved spot until you see him.  Note after defeating King Ape you get the messages about all other trainers don&#39;t have to worry about the wild monster&#39;s attack.  I suspect if you save after defeating the Mad Gaboo &#40;the other S class monster of that errantry&#41; you cannot get the King Ape from a saved game file saved afterwards. I took photos because I saw what a hot topic this was.  I believe anyone should be able to get the same results with about 12 hours of gameplay.  Is there any other means I could use to convince you of this being legit?  I have a save for both immediately before and after spotting him, and am trying to get a hold of a dexdrive now.

 i was thinking, its pretty hard to find proof of finding king ape, since screen shots could be faked and dex drives aren&#39;t very common. But what if Kio sent lisa the photo he took? I think it would be pretty diffacult to fake a picture onto real kodak photo paper, so this may be a way to prove the siting. Just a thought

 Is the Wild Saurian considered just as rare?  From my current save with Jethro, I get that about a third of the time, yet when I look at the results of a negative search &#40;60 attempts with 2 monsters&#41; the wild saurian wasn&#39;t spotted either.  I&#39;m referring to The D&#39;s post up above.  My point being, 13 or 30 attempts isn&#39;t enough to disprove Kio and I.  I&#39;m starting my search again from the same save to see how many attempts it takes to get him again.  When I started my search the first time, I intended to do it 1000 times, then post my results to disprove Kio.  Alas attempt #9 gave me the result I didn&#39;t expect.

 Hmmm... My mega memory card just died, so I have a new file at about this date... I&#39;ll raise an ape to about these stats and try, even though I believe in the whole Pocketstation idea.  100 tries aught to do it.  I&#39;ll post the results when I get done &#40;about a day or two.&#41;

 OK, I&#39;m done.  And here are the results.  I actually decided to spend three hours to raise an ape in int. &#40;What, am I CRAZY???&#41; and get it in B class.  It&#39;s stats are as follows- Name- Try2FndKngAp.  Class-B.  Fame-66, 2 moves.  Age-2yr 10 mo.  Stats-Lif=286 Pow=388 Int=389 Ski=249 Spd=253 Def=83.  Best natured, plump.  So I wait until the 4wkOct and start sending him on the 100.  Here are the results-  try 1- no enemy. try 2- that rascal King Ape.  Here&#39;s my best description of him- Gray, red coat with a dude flexing on the back and a ring on his left hand.  Moves- he used three- Boomerang, and Grab-throw twice.  Boomerang and the second grab-throw hit.  Stats are 856, 688, 192, 414, 456, 577.  Seriously, you don&#39;t have to believe me, but why not spend 3 hours and try.  I know, people have spent hundreds of hours looking for him and if DP can&#39;t find him noone can, right?  Well, I have a theory.  Since no one is rediculous enough to purposely raise an ape in intelligence, then it might be the key.  What I did was to make sure that he was an ape that would get 400 on the errantry and Eurika!  So he does exist!  Wow!

 Jethro&#39;s stats at the time he found King Ape. <BR>Lif 415 Pow 836 Int 266 Ski 861 Spd 833 Def 162 <BR>I don&#39;t think 400 int is the requirement.  :&#41;  Special events in Jethro&#39;s life, mock seeds, first house upgrade, first barn upgrade, won the IMA/FIMBA match at rank D &#40;the team also won&#41;, reached rank 9.  However considering Ketran found him without &#40;probably&#41; any of those events, that&#39;s irrelevant.  The only theory I have at this point is perhaps there is a bug with the way errantry opponents are flagged.  The other high level errantry opponents, once defeated, that one cannot be fought again.  Perhaps if you defeat one of the other high level errantry opponents, King Ape&#39;s gets flagged at the same time.  Which would explain why starting a new game works.  Otherwise, statisticly speaking, you should see him at least once every 176 int errantry attempts &#40;assuming equal chances for each possible errantry opponent and an equal chance for no opponent&#41;.  My UPC # is the same as Ketran&#39;s.  Thank you Ketran for taking the effort.

 &#34;My point being, 13 or 30 attempts isn&#39;t enough to disprove Kio and I.&#34; <BR> <BR>No, I didn&#39;t stop because I thought it would disprove you, I stopped because the first time Kio claimed he found it with a Stone Mask, which would disprove the ape theory, and therefore make it seem really easy to get King Ape, which it isn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>Also, we don&#39;t have to disprove you, you have to prove yourself.  I said in the m-r.com topic that if someone sends me a dex drive save of before they went on the errantry and I can duplicate their results then I&#39;d believe.  I don&#39;t think pictures will cut it, but if you want to send them maybe it&#39;ll help.

 You are correct, I am supposed to prove myself.  Although technically I was proving Kio.  My point on the 13 or 30 attempts isn&#39;t enough is that using basic statistics, 30 attempts isn&#39;t enough.  The magic number in statistics is 11.  So if there are 16 random possible errantry endings &#40;1 no battle and 15 opponents&#41; and assuming the chance of each outcome is equally possible &#40;a very large assumption&#41;, then 11 x 16 is 176.  That means if you do 176 int errantries you are 95% likely to encounter the King Ape at least once.  Note you still have a 5% chance of not seeing him.  The math gets much more complicated if the chances of each outcome are not equal. <BR> <BR>Kio posted that he restarted and found the King Ape a second time.  So I went to my recently started game and tried.  I was duplicating his results.  When I posted my results and offered my best available proof, I was dismissed without even having my evidence examined.  And yes, I&#39;m getting a little irate.  If you look back at my posting history, you&#39;ll notice I put up a low cost, work with any monster, no special items requirement method that works better than any similar method on this site.  Yet I obviously have no credibility but you do.

 The mango method does not cause life loss.

 could be.  people tend to trust familiar names.  i know some people here spent weeks trying to find that most private of primates...i&#39;m not sure they would believe anyone. <BR> <BR>i have no basis to disbelieve anything you or kio said &#91;once kio came back the second time, that is&#93;.  when we stumble across a duplicatable method, the matter will be resolved.  a lot of people are trying right now to do that...thats an indication of belief right there.

 Actually, it is a suspension of disbelief until further notice. That is why we are trying to duplicate your results. <BR> <BR>The only interesting result I have so far is that Loyalty seems intimately tied to failing one or more stages at errantry.

 whoa, it&#39;s close.  Looked it up and mango is -10 fatigue, it puts you at LI 69 before that mint leaf, 1 point away from a hit.  If you enter that method with any fatigue or stress, you&#39;ll take hits, but the method is safe otherwise. <BR> <BR>from what I&#39;ve seen I can confirm the connection between loyalty and success at errantries.

 Ok, getting a chance to look over all these posts.... I&#39;m a bit amazed. Two people encountering the beast although, both stating different Stats of the ape. Which to believe? Well, to me neither. Pictures might actually do it, but to people still might not be enough. The only thing to do is for more people to encounter the same thing, which unfortuanetly noone has done. I&#39;d like to see how any more results come out, but maybe from a different person testing. <BR> <BR>And torey is right about the trusting part. People do tend to trust more familiar people with the site, but I&#39;m not saying not to trust you or that I don&#39;t, but people have put a lot of time to finding this ape and never found anything. But all of your ideas, and suggestions are good ones and testable ones. Maybe King Ape will be triggered and is, but then again, maybe not. The only way to find out is research. <BR> <BR>Good luck on any futher research.

 About a month ago i posted something about loyalty affecting failures esp. at errantries. i think it is still in the misc. Q&amp;A section. <BR> <BR>I can see why you are mad, bladerunner. it seems so unbelieveable to people that have searched hours upon hours to find king ape and then some newB just so happens to stumble upon him. when i first heard it, i couldn&#39;t believe it. then, when i saw your post about duplicating results, my jaw dropped.  <BR> <BR>Well, i can&#39;t try it out now cause we have better things to do right now, so ill try finding king ape some other time. i believe you, bladerunner, ketran and kio.

They all started new games to do it, might have to be first 10 years or something like that. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;m extremely skeptical of all of you who claim to have found it, but if DP would&#39;ve said it, I would&#39;ve tested whatever he did to see if it was correct.

 Ok, I&#39;ve purchased a spare memory card.  I need one volunteer that I can mail it to to do some testing.  Before anyone volunteers, I want you to consider the time investment first.  It took me one hour of tries the first time, and 2 hours the second.  It might take you five minutes or it could take 6 hours.

 wow, I have also just seen the pictures and like mepersoner said &#34; There is nothing obviously fake about them&#34; at all that is. You know Blade, I think having someone that is a regular and known person around here is the person that should be taking that memory card. People won&#39;t trust someone in all that great, unless he/she was known. I think Lisa would be the best person to actually test the results to this, but I doubt she has the most free time on her hands. Well, I hope we can pull through with this major discovery.....

 Anon has now posted a screenshot in the mr2 section of m-r.com.  the evidence is piling up at a very rapid rate. <BR> <BR>the only thing we are now missing is a specific roadmap on how to easily &#91;or at least with certainty&#93; find the <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> dirty ape for ourselves.

 My ape only had 266 int when I found him, so int isn&#39;t the key.  Not sure you&#39;ll ever find that road map.  It could just be that his percent chance to show is low, and we only recently tried enough times.  I know you say everybody has tried so many times before, but the only published numbers I&#39;ve seen were 2 players each doing 30 attempts, and I&#39;ve already given you the math why that isn&#39;t enough.  It will take a couple of months, but I might eventually have enough samples to give his approximate chance to show.  In case you are wondering, I&#39;m looking at generating a sample size of 1100 attempts.

 ya - the degree of skepticism ran so high that those who found  king ape - kio, ketran, bladerunner and anon - ran into a brick wall in trying to present their findings.  i was one of the bricks in that wall.  luckily for us, they fought their way through the wall, and presented rock solid evidence of the bashful ape&#39;s existence.  well done!

 wow, someone actualy found him. That amazes me a lot. I probably did not try enough to find him, but I think BR is doing a lot of work on him. I would be a more part in this, but as I said, I&#39;m busy as heck. But Good Luck on futher research, and great job, all of you!

 This King Ape thread is getting really long... almost as long as my very first thread... <BR> <BR>Well, I&#39;ll be checking to see if it&#39;s ever figured out exactly how the King Ape is encountered.

 Ya shoulda listened to me.  Told ya game year had something to do with it.  Perhaps the ape only picks on innocent, new people &#40;hence the reason he only fights early on in the game, and seems to have an affinity for B rank monsters&#41;.

 random thought: What if the flag, or whatever its called, that makes it impossible to find king ape is the same one that causes item sales to stop appearing? I can test this out, because i have a game that is at around the year 1090, and i still have item sales. I also have an ape in the freezer at B class, who i tried to use to find king ape a while ago &#40;But only sent him during the first week&#41; i dunno how many tries i&#39;ll do, but i&#39;ll post my results. Probably only 50 or so, maybe a few more

 hmmm... i&#39;m currently rasing a gibberer in search of king ape... &#40;Actually, hes searching right now as i type this&#41; and had a question for those of you who found it. How did you reply to Dr. Talico when he wanted you to go on an expedition with him? Thats the only event i have seen &#40;Other than the mandatory raising of rank you get for beating the official tourneys&#41; I beleive that there is a glitch that stops king ape from being encounterable after a certain event takes place. This is why no one has found him before this &#40;Other than newbies, who just started the game&#41;

 I did not send mine on any expeditions.  Kio stated he sent his on all the expeditions he was invited to.  So I don&#39;t think expeditions have anything to do with it.

 just a thought. maybe finishing the pare pare expidition removes him or maybe you must go on the pare pare expidition to make him available for the next year. Maybe he will only appear when you are given the discount on the errantries. No answers only suggestions of possible links :&#40;
