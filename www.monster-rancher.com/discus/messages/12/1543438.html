<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'torey_luvullo'-!>
There are alot of different theories regarding the &#40;&#43;1&#41; bubble, which is sometimes seen when you train in a particular drill/errantry. Some attribute it to stress/fatigue decrease, some attribute it to loyalty increase, some attribute it to tech usage increase, and some attribute it to stat increase during drills.  <BR> <BR>To settle this controversy, I have done an experiment to test out the effects of the &#40;&#43;1&#41; bubble. &#40;If you don&#39;t care for the evidence, then proceed to the bottom for the definition&#41;.  <BR> <BR>EVIDENCE:  <BR> <BR>I used three test subjects:  <BR> <BR>1&#41; subject 1 is a 1st gen purebreed wracky named &#34;A&#34;.  <BR> <BR>2&#41; subject 2 is a 1st gen purebreed wracky which was combined with a 1st gen phoenix. The result is a 2nd gen purebreed wracky named &#34;B&#34;.  <BR> <BR>3&#41; subject 3 is a 1st gen purebreed wracky which was combined with a 1st gen phoenix. A &#34;henger&#34; disk, which gives the &#40;&#43;1&#41; bubble on the shoot drill, was used as secret seasoning. The result is a 2nd gen purebreed wracky named &#34;C&#34;.  <BR> <BR>I raised the 3 subjects in a similar fashion. I used a continuous monthly pattern of: &#40;shoot,shoot,shoot,rest&#41; for 12 months each. Stress was controlled with the usage of mint leafs and tablets. Each subject was fed milk for the first 4 months. I did not reload. &#34;A&#34; liked milk, didn&#39;t mind tablets. &#34;B&#34; didn&#39;t like milk, didn&#39;t mind tablets. &#34;C&#34; didn&#39;t like milk, didn&#39;t mind tablets.  <BR> <BR>A 12 month period is a safe time period to do the testing because it is known that a purebred wracky has a stage 1 length of 4 years approx. Therefore, the time that which drill results slightly increase, is half of stage 1. In wracky&#39;s case, it is 2 years. Hence, 1 year ensures that no drill increase will occur.  <BR> <BR>THE DATA: ##&#40;abc&#41;, ## = month number, a = week 1 drill, b = week 2 drill, c = week 3 drill. If &#40;a, b or c&#41; = 0, implies that subject performed a &#34;failure.&#34;  <BR> <BR>A&#41; 01&#40;131&#41;, 02&#40;331&#41;, 03&#40;113&#41;, 04&#40;102&#41;, 05&#40;101&#41;, 06&#40;222&#41;, 07&#40;121&#41;, 08&#40;211&#41;, 09&#40;212&#41;, 10&#40;131&#41;, 11&#40;212&#41;, 12&#40;133&#41;: TOTAL = 58, LOYALTY = 32  <BR> <BR>B&#41; 01&#40;112&#41;, 02&#40;332&#41;, 03&#40;113&#41;, 04&#40;222&#41;, 05&#40;111&#41;, 06&#40;021&#41;, 07&#40;223&#41;, 08&#40;312&#41;, 09&#40;310&#41;, 10&#40;111&#41;, 11&#40;333&#41;, 12&#40;121&#41;: TOTAL = 62, LOYALTY = 26  <BR> <BR>C&#41; 01&#40;321&#41;, 02&#40;342&#41;, 03&#40;441&#41;, 04&#40;031&#41;, 05&#40;111&#41;, 06&#40;022&#41;, 07&#40;440&#41;, 08&#40;111&#41;, 09&#40;411&#41;, 10&#40;214&#41;, 11&#40;212&#41;, 12&#40;442&#41;: TOTAL = 74, LOYALTY = 49  <BR> <BR>RESULTS: &#34;A&#34; and &#34;B&#34; never reached 4 at any time. This implies that the &#40;&#43;1&#41; on &#34;C&#34; helped it achieve 4 points. You must note the peculiar surge of training results in the 1st 4 months of the subjects&#39; lives. This may be the result of feeding them milk, or it could just be a result of the subject trying to adapt to your training style. Another thing to note, is the resulting loyalties obtained from each subject. &#34;C&#34; had a significantly higher loyalty at the end of the 12 month test period. This may be the result of the subject liking the drill in which the &#40;&#43;1&#41; bubble is placed, or it could just be a coincidence.  <BR> <BR>NOTE: It is shown from the data that &#34;C&#34; got 1 on several drills even when it has the &#40;&#43;1&#41; bubble. However, this does not mean that the &#40;&#43;1&#41; didn&#39;t work. It simply means that any monster can receive 0 on a drill, but it will output as 1 unless you have expired your lifespan. Here&#39;s an idea of the cpu&#39;s algorithm for calculating drills:  <BR> <BR>Step 1&#41; If &#34;truancy&#34; or &#34;failure,&#34; then do not output a number. If not, proceed to step 2.  <BR> <BR>Step 2&#41; If lifespan is expired, output 0. If not, proceed to step 3.  <BR> <BR>Step 3&#41; CPU calculates random number from possible range. Ex, Wracky during first half of stage 1: range of 0 - 3.  <BR> <BR>Step 4&#41; CPU tabulates any &#40;&#43;1&#41; bubbles. Ex, if 0 was chosen, then the result of step 3 is: 0 &#43; 1 = 1. If 3 was chosen, then the result is 3 &#43; 1 = 4.  <BR> <BR>Step 5&#41; Calculate any &#34;cheat&#34; or &#34;great&#34; and use respective algorithm to add/subtract to the result of step 3.  <BR> <BR>Step 6&#41; If result is less than 1, output 1. If the result is greater than 20, output 20. &#40;&#42;&#42;NOTE&#42;&#42;: This is the reason why you see a 1 when your monster really got a 0. If you have the &#40;&#43;1&#41;, then you&#39;ll get a 1 because your monster actually got a 1&#41;  <BR> <BR>From this data, a semi-conclusive definition can now be formed.  <BR> <BR>DEFINITION OF &#40;&#43;1&#41;: A &#40;&#43;1&#41; symbol seen in drills/errantries, can be obtained by usage of disk chips when combining, or you already have them &#40;determined by breed/subbreed&#41;. The &#40;&#43;1&#41; gives you an additional point to your respective drill/errantry stat increase. If 2 or 3 stats are being affected by the drill/errantry, then the &#40;&#43;1&#41; affects only the primary stat &#40;the top one&#41;. Although not thoroughly tested, it is believed that a slight increase of loyalty is added every time you do a drill/errantry with the &#40;&#43;1&#41; bubble &#40;probably because your monster excels at it and hence, likes it&#41;.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;RNA@Ribosome.nuc&#41;, December 22, 1999  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Looks good to me RNA! Anyone have evidence of the same caliber to refute this? This info of course does not preclude the &#43;1 from affecting technique chains or other attributes, but it makes other hypothetical effects less likely. Thank you RNA.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;honcho7@excite.com&#41;, December 22, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Hey RNA, <BR>Wow! I always look forward to your posts -- its cool to hear about how you are unravelling the mysteries of this game. Two questions: <BR>1. I think there are disc chips that give monsters &#43;1 on the hard drills... do you think this could be used to factor into your kick-ass raising method? &#40;Like, harddrill,harddrill-it-likes,harddrill...&#41; <BR> <BR>2. Do you have an FAQ or website with all of your research? I often find myself plowing through 50 messages along the lines of &#34;how do I get a Zilla?&#34; to find messages of merit like yours.  <BR> <BR>-- Bill Mick &#40;otterzero@hotmail.com&#41;, December 22, 1999.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>one small note you said that a monster would only show a 0 in a drill at the end of its life, that is not true. I had a Golem/Tiger that got 0 in spd on drills until it was 3 mon. old. Also when it fought and I got the bouns in the three stats, two were 0 until it was 3 mon. old.  <BR> <BR>-- Jeff &#40;nemesis_7777@yahoo.com&#41;, December 22, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>One thing I forgot to note: You can also get a &#34;0&#34; in a drill/battle if you have already maxxed out that stat that you are trying to increase. Jeff, since you hot the &#34;0&#34; until 3 months old, I can assume that you used a gameshark to max out some stats so that you can aquire no more in that area. There may be something else that made you get those &#34;0&#39;s,&#34; such as certain items? etc? Out of the 185 years of game playing, I have never seen my monster get a &#34;0&#34; on any increase during a drill or after a battle. Maybe I&#39;ve missed something?  <BR>Farmer Jimbo is right about the tech aquisition part. This experiment does NOT prove anything about the &#40;&#43;1&#41; affecting anything else. ie, tech aquisition, stress, fatigue, form, etc. It ONLY proves that the &#40;&#43;1&#41; adds an additional point to your stat gains in drills and the possible loyalty increase.  <BR> <BR>However, not all things need to be proved. I can only explain why I do not think that the &#40;&#43;1&#41; affects other things.  <BR> <BR>TECH AQUISITION: For the &#40;&#43;1&#41; in the errantries, it would seem believable that the &#40;&#43;1&#41; could also act as an additional usage of the tech which resides in that errantry. However, a &#40;&#43;1&#41; symbol on an errantry SHOULD have the same function as those of normal drills. Since normal drills do not contain techs to be learned, they would not benefit from the same function as those of the errantry &#40;&#43;1&#41;&#39;s. ie, what tech would a &#34;meditate&#34; help unlock &#40;It trains both INT and SKI&#41;? Would it help unlock the INT tech, or the SKI tech, or both? Also, what tech would a &#34;run&#34; help unlock &#40;it trains LIF&#41;? What tech would this help unlock?  <BR> <BR>It could be that only the errantry &#40;&#43;1&#41; disks would increase a tech usage by 1. That would probably explain the high value of such disks as most&#40;all?&#41; of them are priced at 2000G whereas normal &#40;&#43;1&#41; disks are priced at 500G - 1000G. However, a symbol&#40;such as &#40;&#43;1&#41;&#41; should hold a uniform function because well..... it is the same symbol! It would be unlikely for the programmers to use the same symbol to attribute different functions.  <BR> <BR>STRESS: I have reasons to believe that Stress is measures on 100pts, where 0 = no stress, 50 = stressed, 100 = life-threatening stress. However, I will not post my reasons as it will take too much space. So how would a &#40;&#43;1&#41; help? would it increase/decrease your stress level by 1 point? Wow! Big difference &#40;sarcasm&#41;.  <BR> <BR>FATIGUE/FORM: Same as stress.  <BR> <BR>BENEFIT OF &#40;&#43;1&#41;:  <BR> <BR>The &#40;&#43;1&#41; disk chips are VERY useful by themselves &#40;especially the henger/&#40;&#43;1&#41; on SKI&#41;. Example - henger disk. Say your monster gets 2 - 6 SKI&#40;average = 4&#41; in stage 1 and 4 - 10&#40;average = 7&#41; in stage 2. This monster gets 1 year in stage 1, and another 1 year in stage 2.  <BR> <BR>Using a &#40;LightTrain,LightTrain,LightTrain,LightTrain&#41; monthly pattern, I could get &#91;averageStage1 X numberOfDrillsPerMonth X numberOfMonths&#93; &#43; &#91;averageStage2 X numberOfDrillsPerMonth X numberOfMonths&#93; = &#91;4 X 4 X 12&#93; &#43; &#91;7 X 4 X 12&#93; = 192 &#43; 336 = 528 SKI,  <BR> <BR>Because of the &#40;&#43;1&#41; bubble, I can add an additional 1 point to the averages: 3 - 7&#40;average = 5&#41; in stage 1, 5 - 11&#40;average = 8&#41; in stage 2. Thus, the resulting formula would be: &#91;5 X 4 X 12&#93; &#43; &#91;8 X 4 X 12&#93; = 240 &#43; 384 = 624 SKI.  <BR> <BR>In 2 years time, I could get an additional 100 point increase in SKI just because of the &#40;&#43;1&#41;! That&#39;s way more than any disk chip can provide. However, this example is only theoretical and it would also be unlikely for someone to train SKI for the full stage 1 and 2.  <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, using these disk chips can GREATLY increase your gains in a drill/errantry if you plan on investing alot of time using the respecive drill/errantry. They have the potential of being more effective than any other secret seasoning that involves stat gains.  <BR> <BR>With this much power, it would seem quite unbalanced if these disks ALSO helped in unlocking techs.  <BR> <BR>In response to Bill: yes, these disk chips could be VERY helpful. I usually only use the crab claw for combining because of its &#43;50 SKI and &#43;50 SPD. However, since my method calls for so much training in SKI, I bet the henger disk chip would prove to be VERY useful.  <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, no I don&#39;t have a faq or website in which my research is placed. I am only giving back to this board for all the info it has given me. Putting all this stuff in a faq or webpage will seriously cut into my video game playing. However, Lao has a pretty good datasheet&#40;faq&#41; with alot of info compiled into it. It doesn&#39;t include some things like the &#40;&#43;1&#41;, monster life stages, complete tech aquisition, etc. but it does include all the other useful info about MR2. It is located in &#34;Breed Information requested--Prime stats&#34; which is in the &#34;best monster to use&#34; category.  <BR> <BR>Maybe someone could make a nice faq that has all the updated info? There are alot of really &#34;good&#34; information on this board but it just needs somebody to put it all together. I don&#39;t mind people putting my research in their faqs as long as they credit me&#40;can&#39;t really ask me about it since my email is fake&#41;. I bet all the others who have contributed to this board wouldn&#39;t mind having their information placed in a faq as well. It&#39;s a good idea, but only if someone will do it. The faqs at Gamefaqs just won&#39;t do....  <BR> <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;RNA@Ribosome.nuc&#41;, December 23, 1999.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to also point out to jeff &#40;and others&#41; that if a monster dislikes: battle it will recieve some 0&#39;s during the stat aquisition phase in E level tourneys &#40;and maybe d as well, though I doubt it&#41;. Presumably the dislike subtracts a point &#40;or more&#41; from each stat gain per fight &#40;i.e. if you would have scored &#43; 13 in an S class fight it would show up as &#43; 12 or lower&#41; I wonder if liking battle increases the stat gain? and if this persists after like changes to &#40;trainer name&#41;?  <BR> <BR>-- WildCard &#40;rincewind@uswest.net&#41;, December 23, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>That&#39;s new info. I never knew that liking/disliking battles would affect your stat gains. I thought it only increased/decreased loyalty. But then again, I never see a difference after battle. You learn something new everyday....  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;RNA@Ribosome.nuc&#41;, December 24, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>RNA... how long does you play MR2 every day?  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;abimono@mailcity.com&#41;, December 24, 1999.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I play whenever I have free time. At least 5 hours a day and as much as 10 hours a day. I&#39;ve been slowing down lately. You&#39;d think I&#39;d get more time to play it in the holidays, but I always need to do stuff. Besides, my gf doesn&#39;t let me play monster rancher when she&#39;s over. It&#39;s always Chocobo racing! &#34;I wanna play chocobo racing!&#34;  <BR>I&#39;ve been neglecting other cool rpg&#39;s because I still can&#39;t get MR2 out of my hands. I still have yet to try Suikoden 2, grandia, thousand arms, and GT2. I&#39;m afraid that I won&#39;t be able to get back onto MR2 if I start GT2. I still want to raise every purebreed.  <BR> <BR>Why do you ask?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;RNA@Ribosome.nuc&#41;, December 25, 1999.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>yeah, my g/f is the same, all she wants to do is play chocobo racing! its a great game, but after you beat her with golem, mog, and goblin, &#40;the ones they give you not edited&#41; and she uses bahamut, chocobo, and behemoth &#40;all maxed out&#41; and you win, then it gets boring! i just love that game so much, i basicaly stoped playing anything but that for 2 weeks, i mean, i didnt even play marvel vs capcom, my favorite game on earth!! melenium link out~  <BR> <BR>-- Link &#40;Gr Jarkeld@Aol.Com&#41;, December 25, 1999.
