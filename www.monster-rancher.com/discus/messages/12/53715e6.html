<CENTER><B>This post is an archived thread from our other location.  <BR>Much of the info in it is out of date.  <BR>We retain it in honor of RNA, who posted the second Monster Rancher 2 method, outlined below. This was the first example of a published method that game superior results.  <BR>This was before anyone had hacked into the inner workings of the game, so exact values were not known at the time.</B></CENTER> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><B>&#40;1&#41;THIS METHOD IS <U>NOT</U> FOR YOU IF YOU APPLY TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:</B> <BR> <BR><B>&#40;a&#41;</B> You are a beginner.  <BR><B>&#40;b&#41;</B> You have less than $200,000.  <BR><B>&#40;c&#41;</B> You don&#39;t want to risk losing money from raising your monster.  <BR><B>&#40;d&#41;</B> You are impatient and do not like to &#34;reload&#34; countless times.  <BR><B>&#40;e&#41;</B> You don&#39;t really care about super high stats and just want to play the game for fun.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;2&#41;THIS METHOD <U>IS</U> FOR YOU IF YOU APPLY TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:</B> <BR> <BR><B>&#40;a&#41;</B> You have played this game for awhile, opened up many breeds, and want really high stats.  <BR><B>&#40;b&#41;</B> You want high enough stats to easily take out cpu monsters, ie, Bighand, Zilla King, Akirel, Hammed, White Mocchi, etc.  <BR><B>&#40;c&#41;</B> You want a monster that will demolish your friend&#40;s&#41;&#39; monsters.  <BR><B>&#40;d&#41;</B> You have over $200,000 and you don&#39;t care how much money you lose in the process.  <BR><B>&#40;e&#41;</B> You don&#39;t mind &#34;reloading&#34; alot.  <BR><B>&#40;f&#41;</B> You want to beat the major 4 and become a master trainer with little difficulty.  <BR> <BR><U>If you fall into category</U> <B>&#40;1&#41;</B>, then I suggest you try wildcard&#39;s method in the &#34;How do you ppl do it.......... &#40;WildCard&#39;s infamous method&#41;&#34; thread from the &#34;Raising/Training Methods&#34; category. Zir method is less money consuming and it gets you from a beginner to an advanced player in no time. Because of less usage of game mechanics, you&#39;ll be able to adapt to zir method with less difficulty. <BR> <BR><U>If you fall into category</U> <B>&#40;2&#41;</B>, then read on. &#40;<B>note:</B> for the extreme players of category 2, you may want to try out Dark Phoenix&#39;s, &#34;Dark Phoenix&#39;s &#40;in&#41;famous raising method&#34; in the &#34;Raising/Training Methods&#34; category. I maxxed out a 3rd gen undine on my very first try! Be prepared for the lengthy process&#41;  <BR> <BR><B><CENTER>====INTRO====</CENTER></B>  <BR> <BR>This is a self devised method used to make powerful monsters. I constantly get 1st generation monsters with stat totals in excess of 4000 points. With 2nd&#43; gen monsters, it is possible to get monsters with 5000&#43; points &#40;See bottom of method for examples&#41;.  <BR> <BR>This is a 3rd revision of my method. The original 1.0 is located in the thread, &#34;Advanced Raising Method For Optimum Results - version 1.0,&#34; residing in the &#34;Raising/Training Methods&#34; category. The reason that I posted a revision &#40;2.0&#41;, is because the original thread had become too cluttered with info&#40;100&#43; posts&#41;. Also, my main method was originally split up into 3 parts and many people tend to miss the other 2. A version &#40;3.0&#41;, was reposted due to a hacker problem on the board, which resulted in many deleted threads, including my version 2.0&#40;revised&#41;. Version &#40;4.0&#41;, as you see now, is another repost due to a repeated hacker problem at B Campbell&#39;s board. It now resides only on Lisa Shock&#39;s Monster Rancher Metropolis &#40;unless someone else has posted it elsewhere, which I do not mind&#41; <BR> <BR><B>New stuff added to version 2.0 includes:</B> several side comments, some slight modifications, the elimination of the extra rest after each battle of the &#34;Freezing Process&#34;, the use of paradoxine/troron for monsters with low stat aquisitions, and the addition of my alias in the title&#40;for easy searching&#41;.  <BR> <BR><B>New stuff added to version 3.0 includes:</B> even more side comments, correction to the paradoxine method, some corrections to method conversions&#40;transitions&#41;, more accurate thread directions&#40;Thanks, Vheod and Jeli Kocoe&#41;, and an added paradoxine-raised example.  <BR> <BR><B>New stuff added to version 4.0 includes:</B> changes in side comments. Added more examples. Usage of the metropolis&#39; formatting to enhance readability. <BR> <BR><B><CENTER>====PURPOSE OF MY METHOD====</CENTER></B>  <BR> <BR>This method&#39;s purpose, is to work your monster to its fullest, so that you get the highest stats possible for your monster, hence the title&#39;s wording - optimum. As a side-effect, your monster will have an amazingly high lifespan. The negative effects that come with this method includes; less time to &#34;unlock&#34; techs, and less time to battle &#40;ie, you will almost never have a monster that has a win/loss record totalling 150&#43;&#41;. Also, because of my inclusion of almost <B>EVERY</B> detail, the screw-up factor in using my method is very low.  <BR> <BR><B><CENTER>====THREADS THAT YOU SHOULD READ ABOUT====</CENTER></B>  <BR> <BR>These threads contain useful information that will help you in the process of using this method  <BR> <BR>For information about a monster&#39;s life stages, read the thread, &#34;monsters life stages&#34; in the &#34;FAQ&#34; category. &#40;by Vheod, RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR>For an alternative, and much more easily understandable reading about a monster&#39;s life stages, read the thread, &#34;The Monster Rancher View of Life Stages&#34; in the &#34;FAQ&#34; category. &#40;by RNA&#41; <BR> <BR>For a tech list on most monsters, check out the site: <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Maze/6761/mhaven.htm" TARGET="_top">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Maze/6761/mhaven.htm</A> &#40;referred to me by Vheod&#41;  <BR> <BR>For information about techniques/chains, read the thread, &#34;Definition of: Tech Chain &#40;How to get most of the techs for your monster&#41;&#34; in the &#34;Techs/Tech Chains&#34; category. &#40;by RNA&#41; <BR> <BR>For an alternative source, read the thread, &#34;So ya wanna get those Techniques, huh?&#34; in the &#34;Techs/Tech Chains&#34; category. &#40;by Nate Railsback&#41;  <BR> <BR>For additional information on techs/chains, read the thread, &#34;Predicted Technique Chains &#40;Zoink&#39;s tech chain studies&#41;&#34; in the &#34;techniques/tech chains&#34; category. &#40;by Zoinks - he pioneered the studies on techs/chains&#41;  <BR> <BR>For information about subbreed specific techs, read the thread, &#34;Breed specific techs/chains&#34; in the &#34;Techs/Tech Chains&#34; category. &#40;by RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR>For additional information about subbreed specific techs, read the thread, &#34;More on cross-over&#40;subbreed specific&#41; techs&#34; in the &#34;techniques/tech chains&#34; category. &#40;by Nate Railsback&#41;  <BR> <BR>For information about techs involving nature, read the thread, &#34;The Good, the Bad, and the Neutral &#40;nature&#39;s effect to tech aquisition&#41;&#34; in the &#34;Techs/Tech Chains&#34; category. &#40;by Nate Railsback&#41;  <BR> <BR>For information about paradoxine, read the thread, &#34;Drug Report: PARADOXINE&#34; in the &#34;items&#34; <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#222;</FONT> &#34;Items Found on Expeditions&#34; category. &#40;by Dark Phoenix&#41;  <BR> <BR>For information about troron, read the thread, &#34;Report on the effect of TRORON&#34; in the &#34;items&#34; <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#222;</FONT> &#34;The Item Shop&#34; category. &#40;by Dark Phoenix&#41;  <BR> <BR>NOTE: All information about paradoxines/trorons should be credited to both, Dark phoenix and Farmer jimbo for their work in this field.  <BR> <BR>For information on what most items do, read the thread, &#34;Compilation of Items and their Functions,&#34; in the &#34;FAQ&#34; category. &#40;by Dark Phoenix&#41;  <BR> <BR>For information about a monster&#39;s stat aquisition in all 6 stats, read the thread, &#34;Monster Attributes &#40;monsters and their effectiveness in drills&#41;&#34; in the &#34;FAQ&#34; category. &#40;by RNA, Vheod, Mikey, Dark Phoenix, El_Buttweasle, &amp; Onomiba&#41;  <BR> <BR>For evidence to the effects of battling on lifespan, read the thread, &#34;How do you ppl do it.......... &#40;WildCard&#39;s infamous method&#41;&#34; in the &#34;Raising/Training Methods&#34; category. &#40;by RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR>For information on getting better combos, read the thread, &#34;Finding and Keeping a good combo&#34; in the &#34;Breeding/Combining&#34; category. &#40;by Dark phoenix&#41;  <BR> <BR>For additional info on combos, read the thread, &#34;Good Combos. Let me know about them!&#34; in the &#34;Breeding/Combining&#34; category. &#40;by Dark phoenix&#41;  <BR> <BR>For information on combo prospects, read the thread, &#34;Combining Prospects: Dadge&#39;s comments on your combo&#34; in the &#34;Breeding/Combining&#34; category. &#40;by RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR>For information on generations, read the thread, &#34;Generations and Other Topics&#34; in the &#34;Breeding/Combining&#34; category. <BR> <BR><B><CENTER>====21 THINGS TO NOTE BEFORE GOING ON &#40;MUST READ!&#41;====</CENTER></B>  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;1&#41;</B> Every monster will get different results depending on what kind of monster you use. There are 2 factors that determine the outcome of your monster: <B>&#40;a&#41;</B> <U>Lifespan</U> <B>&#40;b&#41;</B> <U>Stat aquisition</U>  <BR> <BR>Stat aquisition refers to the ability of you monster to gain points in all 6 of its stats, LIF-POW-INT-SKI-SPD-DEF. The more stats a monster does well in, the higher its stat aquistion. <BR> <BR><B>&#40;2&#41;</B> Lifespan Deficiency Syndrome&#40;LDS&#41; refers to any monster that has an overall low lifespan.  <BR> <BR>Examples of low stat aquisition monsters: Wracky, Pixie, Metalner.  <BR> <BR>Examples of monsters that contain LDS: Pixie, Metalner, Gali, Joker, Undine.  <BR> <BR>Examples of round monsters&#40;has high stat aguisition and high lifespan&#41;: Phoenix, Durahan, Mocchi.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;3&#41;</B> However, monsters change with different subbreeds and different generations. But the ideal monster to use&#40;if you want really high stats&#41;, is a monster with a high lifespan and one that is good in almost every stat&#40;a round monster&#41;.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;4&#41;</B> So if your monster is suffering from LDS, just use this method until they&#39;re old, then combine and try to get a fine/good/great combo. If your monster is suffering from low stat aquisition, combine it with a monster that excels in the stats that your current monster lacks in &#40;ie, golem lacks in INT and SPD. Combine it with a tiger so that you get a golem/tiger that is good in every stat&#41;  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;5&#41;</B> Good/Great combos: If you want a parent monster that can pass the 5000pt mark, then you gotta have either a fine, good, or great combo. The 2 monsters that you&#39;re combining should have pretty good stats with a few of them in the 800&#43; region. You should start off with 2 or more stats at 400&#43; after combining. You know that your monster will be really good if it starts off with at least 1500&#43; points.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;6&#41;</B> How to get above-average combos: This information is still sketchy. There is a way to &#34;force&#34; a monster into a good combo but it takes alot of time and patience. The best way to do so, if you don&#39;t want to use the forcing method, is to make sure that your secondary&#40;not raised yet&#41; monster makes at least an &#34;unsure&#34; combo with your primary&#40;fully raised&#41; monster. Look at the threads mentioned above for more info.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;7&#41;</B> Once you have a good monster, you should be able to get 4000&#43; even in 1st gens. however, if you start off with a bad one, don&#39;t expect too much. Just make it do its best and combine it later.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;8&#41;</B> Items needed: gemini pot&#40;s&#41;, artemis statue&#40;s&#41;, lump of ice, fire stone, dino tail&#40;s&#41;, golden peach, silver peach&#40;initially, not necessary since most monsters can obtain the silver peach during its lifespan&#41;.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;9&#41;</B> You will never send your monster to expeditions.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;10&#41;</B> Drugs, other than paradoxine/troron, should not be used.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;11&#41;</B> Bad natured monsters will require more loading as cheating will not be tolerated very much in this method.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;12&#41;</B> Make sure your monster either likes tablets or doesn&#39;t mind them. If they like them&#40;lucky for you&#41;, you may modify usage of mint leafs at your own expense. Reducing too many may result in stress. This method is designed for monsters who don&#39;t mind them.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;13&#41;</B> Stress is a continuum&#40;ie, 0=no stress, 50=stressed, 100=max stress&#41;. If your monster is not stressed at the beginning of the month, he may actually have a stress value of say, 20 or 49 and Colt will not mention that your monster is stressed because your monster&#39;s stress value has not breached the 50pt value. <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#92;</FONT> to keep stress level at a minimum, do not modify mint leaf usage.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;14&#41;</B> Always check your monster&#39;s form. I believe that any form other than &#34;normal&#34; will have some impact of your monster. &#40;to date, there is no sufficient evidence to assume any answer as to what form affects&#41;  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;15&#41;</B> Try not to feed your monster cup jellies as they decrease weight.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;16&#41;</B> Do not train in LIF. If you want LIF for your monster, just train in POW and DEF. For many monsters, LIF will eventually work out to be: &#91; LIF = &#40;POW&#43;DEF&#41; &#247; 2 &#93;. This equation will become more apparent as both POW and DEF go to 999. In this state, the LIF value is usually a little bit lower than 999 even in monsters that are good at LIF aquisition. However, if you&#39;ve got all the maxxed stats that you want and you have nothing better to train in, by all means, go for LIF.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;17&#41;</B> For well rounded 1st Gen monsters, aim to max out at least 3 Stats. For 2nd gen monsters, aim to max out at least 4 stats. Even if you don&#39;t manage to reach your goal, you should have come really close. Now all you need, is to combine and get a better chance next time&#40;with additional stats/techs to start off with&#41;.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;18&#41;</B> your monster will cost you alot of money&#40;up to 100,000&#41;. However, you&#39;ll usually get most of your money back from S class battles, but you will probably not increase/decrease your capital very much by using this method.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;19&#41;</B> <B>&#42;&#42;IMPORTANT&#42;&#42;</B> You will not battle until you reach S class &#40;for maximum stat aquisition after battles&#41;.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;20&#41;</B> Never get KO&#39;d in battle. Try not to lose in any battle.  <BR> <BR><B>&#40;21&#41;</B> Save <B>ALOT</B>. I&#39;m talking every week, you gotta save. Maybe less if your monster is good or best natured. Make 2 saved games if you can. You&#39;ll often have to reload farther back than the week before.  <BR> <BR>Well, enough of that, time for my method...  <BR> <BR><B><CENTER>===============THE PROCEDURE===============</CENTER></B>  <BR> <BR><B>FORMAT:</B>  <BR> <BR><B>=====&#40;period of time this should take place&#41;:</B> &#40;a,b,c,d&#41; &#40;e,f,g,h&#41;  <BR> <BR><B>Definitions:</B> a=week1 training, b=week2 training, c=week3 training, d=week4 training. e=week1 item, f=week2 item, g=week3 item, h=week4 item.

I usually want my monsters to have high POW/INT, SKI, DEF/SPD&#40;or both&#41;. I usually don&#39;t care about LIF and the opposite attacking attribute, POW or INT.  <BR> <BR><B>=====From beginning of stage 2 <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#222;</FONT> half way through stage 2&#40;until stat aquistion slightly increases&#41;:</B> &#40;HT,HT,HT,rest&#41; &#40;candy,ML,NO,ML&#41; <BR> <BR><B>COMMENTS:</B> Feed favourite food&#40;no potatoes&#41;. every 3 months, feed your monster a tablet to ensure stress is at a minimum.  <BR> <BR>some errantries should be done here - replace an entire month with an errantry. Do not fail in any part of an errantry. Make sure you start an errantry at the beginning of the month. Make sure you don&#39;t get KO&#39;d by the end monster - if you know you can&#39;t win, just run away&#40;does not affect record&#41;. <B>&#42;&#42;IMPORTANT&#42;&#42;</B> - Feed tablet before going AND right after errantry to relieve stress down to tolerant level. - replace next month with: &#40;rest, HardTrain,HardTrain,rest&#41; &#40;NO,candy,ML,ML&#41;. If an errantry has just been completed, wait at least 2 full month after the last one before starting another. If too fat, stop feeding candies for awhile. If your monster has not achieved a good enough SKI&#40;for your standards&#41;, then keep training SKI with stage 1 method until desired to stop.  <BR> <BR><B>&#42;&#42;IMPORTANT&#42;&#42;</B> Do not waste training!!! If you are training in INT and you know you&#39;re going to train in SPD later, do not train INT up to 999. If you want to train SPD later, you will waste valuable points from INT gaining. &#40;Leap trains both INT and SPD&#41;. So, if you know your monster has high INT aquisition, train your INT to 600&#43;. If it&#39;s mediocre, train it to 800&#43;. Same goes for every other stat. <B>DON&#39;T WASTE TRAINING!</B>  <BR> <BR>Also, try to focus on your best Stat first as later on&#40;stage 3&#41;, it will gain 20&#43; in hard drills but will only register as 20. ie, don&#39;t train on SPD when you only get 9&#39;s, instead, train on POW which gives you 13-16&#39;s.  <BR> <BR>Do not move on to another stat until you&#39;re done with the current one.  <BR> <BR><B>=====From halfway through stage 2 <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#222;</FONT> stage 3:</B> same procedure as above time period. <BR> <BR><B>COMMENTS:</B> Try to finish all errantries here&#40;except DEF errantries because you can&#39;t do them yet&#41;. follow above comments.  <BR> <BR><CENTER><B>====STAGE 3====</B></CENTER> <BR> <BR><B>NOTES:</B>  <BR><B>&#40;i&#41;</B> Failure/cheating is not tolerated.  <BR><B>&#40;ii&#41;</B> Loyalty should be at max.  <BR><B>&#40;iii&#41;</B> Change nature with sour/sweet jellies in place of &#34;none/candy.&#34;  <BR><B>&#40;iv&#41;</B> If you have 2 of your best stats at 1400&#43;, you&#39;re doing ok &#40;try aiming to max out only 3 stats&#41;.

If you really suck at a certain stat, ie, you get 5-10pts on a stat, forget it. That stat is not for you. Try another one. Stop feeding candies if too fat. Feed monster favorite food.

However, since this is still your prime, you better have pretty high stats because it would be a shame to not train during your prime. Another reason for going towards the freezing process early is if you want to just gain alot of money.  <BR> <BR>From now on, the &#40;&#43;12&#41; symbol will just mean that you used the gold peach.  <BR> <BR><B>=====From 1/4 of the way through stage 3 &#40;&#43;12&#41; <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#222;</FONT> 2/4 of the way through stage 3 &#40;&#43;12&#41;:</B> Same as above.  <BR> <BR><B>COMMENTS:</B> You should start battling in S class tourneys only.

If, after battling, those stats do not go up, reload and try again. &#40;This is the most time consuming part of this method but it is crucial in getting high stats in what you want.&#41; You can get 100 - 200 points in one stat and a few others if you really obey by this rule. Starting the battles earlier in stage 3 helps also, but only if your monster is not getting results that you want. Do this after your prime.  <BR> <BR>Use S class IMA officials to unlock chains if needed&#40;each official tourney has 6 fights&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Do any remaining errantries as needed. This is the time to do your DEF errantries.  <BR> <BR>If you feel that your monster is not getting enough stat increases in drills, you may go on to the &#40;FREEZING PROCESS&#41; which is explained below.  <BR> <BR><B><CENTER>====FREEZING PROCESS====</CENTER></B> <BR> <BR><B>=====From 2/4 of the way through stage 3 &#40;&#43;12&#41; <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#222;</FONT> end of stage 3 &#40;&#43;12&#41;</B> <BR> <BR>Right after fighting in an S class tourney, feed your monster a &#34;nuts oil&#34; and freeze.

After awhile, you will notice that your monster is getting thin, if this happens, just feed your monster a candy and rest for 1 week only, then continue with the process. Continue until your monster is dead. <B>&#42;&#42;Save alot&#42;&#42;</B> After you die, you must reload and use your &#34;Silver peach.&#34; Now, you can either fight 1 to 6 more battles, or freeze your monster so that it can get peaches, fight errantry monsters, expeditions, whatever...  <BR> <BR>Expect to get in 15-30 battles &#40;before your monster dies&#41; if you start the process at this time:<B>=====From 1/4 of the way through stage 3 &#40;&#43;12&#41; <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#222;</FONT> 2/4 of the way through stage 3 &#40;&#43;12&#41;:</B> &#40;your monster should still be getting &#40;17-19&#41;&#43; pts in its best stat&#41;. <BR> <BR>Expect to get into 10-20 battles if you start near the beginning of this time: <B>=====From 2/4 of the way through stage 3 &#40;&#43;12&#41; <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#222;</FONT> end of stage 3 &#40;&#43;12&#41;:</B> &#40;your monster should still be getting 15&#43; pts in its best stat&#41;.  <BR> <BR>If you want a long lived monster&#40;low stats&#41;, do less battling. no matter how much life you lose in battle, you&#39;ll still lose lifespan. You&#39;ll lose a minimum of 2 weeks&#40;maybe more - unconfirmed&#41; of your remaining lifespan for each &#34;tourney&#34; that you participate in. However, if you want a high stat monster, you&#39;re going to have to battle.  <BR> <BR>If you started the freezing process early enough, you may even be able to net yourself a couple hundred thousand $ while you&#39;re at it. If you started late, expect to barely make enough money to cover the expenses of your &#34;super&#34; monster.  <BR> <BR><B><CENTER>===============END OF PROCEDURE===============</CENTER></B> <BR> <BR>Any questions about my method, just post it here and I&#39;ll answer them with the best of my ability.  <BR> <BR>Here is an example of what my phoenix, Firebane, looked like in its stages. If you want a monster to get past the 5000pt barrier, it should have stats roughly around what my phoenix got in its corresponding stages&#40;ORDER: LIF-POW-INT-SKI-SPD-DEF&#41;:  <BR> <BR>Beginning stage 1: 200-150-450-400-300-200. Beginning stage 2: 250-150-600-900-300-300. Beginning stage 3: 500- 100-800-950-300-700. Beginning of freezing process: 650-300-999-950-800-900. End Stats: 814-373-999-999-999-999. As you can see, I gained quite a bit of life and speed in the freezing process. I did a mistake though, I overshot my &#34;meditate&#34; training. I ended up maxing out INT with the &#34;Leap&#34; training and had to stop or else I would waste training.  <BR> <BR>Examples of monsters used with this method&#40;ORDER: LIF-POW-INT-SKI-SPD-DEF&#41;:  <BR> <BR>Caldera&#40;Phoenix/Phoenix&#41; 1st gen: 542-123-999-890-993-937 TOT-4484 LIFESPAN: 8yrs 3m &#40;TRAINER: RNA&#41; <BR> <BR>???&#40;Phoenix/Phoenix&#41; - 1st gen: 650-100-999-999-999-999. &#40;TRAINER: John Johnson&#41;   <BR> <BR>Snowball&#40;Jill/Jill&#41; 1st gen: 644-302-999-904-275-999 TOT-4123 LIFESPAN: 7yrs 4m &#40;TRAINER: RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR>Harvey&#40;Mocchi/Mocchi&#41; 1st gen: 590-522-865-926-912-571 TOT-4387 LIFESPAN: 7yrs 1m &#40;TRAINER: Dark Phoenix&#41;  <BR> <BR>Robo&#40;Dragon/Henger&#41; 1st gen: 675-999-552-687-761-802 TOT-4476 LIFESPAN: 6yrs 1m &#40;TRAINER: Vheod&#41;  <BR> <BR>Mobius&#40;dragon/Henger&#41; 2nd gen: 652-965-304-967-688-976 TOT-4552 6yrs 8m &#40;TRAINER: RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR>Phantasma&#40;Undine/Joker&#41; 2nd gen: 471-047-999-999-999-753 TOT-4268 LIFESPAN: 6yrs 5m &#40;TRAINER: RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR>Minerva&#40;Pixie/Gali&#41; 2nd gen: 411-567-999-999-999-302 TOT-4277 LIFESPAN: 6yrs 3m &#40;TRAINER: RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR>Firebane&#40;Phoenix/Phoenix&#41; 2nd gen: 814-373-999-999-999-999 TOT-5183 LIFESPAN: 8yrs 0m &#40;TRAINER: RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR>Cyber-Zero&#40;Durahan/Metalner&#41; 3rd gen: 901-999-161-999-328-999 TOT-4359 LIFESPAN: 7yrs 7m &#40;TRAINER: RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR>Masamune&#40;Henger/Monol&#41; 3rd gen: 685-913-704-980-921-852 TOT-5055 LIFESPAN: 6yrs 7m &#40;TRAINER: RNA&#41;  <BR> <BR><B><CENTER>====My Paradoxine-Drugged, 1st gen Wracky====</CENTER></B> <BR> <BR>It took me 4 years&#40;4 expeditions&#41; to find 7 paradoxines so that I can pump them into my wracky.

During a chat with Dark Phoenix and Vheod, I kinda stumbled across an acronym for my method while trying to figure out a catchy title for Dark Phoenix&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Check this out: <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff"><B>A</B></FONT>dvanced <FONT COLOR="0000ff"><B>R</B></FONT>aising <FONT COLOR="0000ff"><B>M</B></FONT>ethod for <FONT COLOR="0000ff"><B>O</B></FONT>ptimum <FONT COLOR="0000ff"><B>R</B></FONT>esults  <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#222;</FONT>  <B><FONT COLOR="0000ff">ARMOR</FONT></B> <BR> <BR>So technically, you could call my method: <B>RNA&#39;S ARMOR&#153;</B> <BR>NOTE: If I ever get around to making a raising method for MR3, you know what the title&#39;s gonna be. <BR> <BR>Also, if you&#39;re wondering if we ever came up with a nice name for Dark Phoenix&#39;s raising method, then get a load of this: <BR> <BR><B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">F</FONT></B>rickin&#39; <B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">A</FONT></B>wesome <B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">R</FONT></B>aising <B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">M</FONT></B>ethod for <B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">E</FONT></B>nhanced <B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">R</FONT></B>esults  <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#222;</FONT>  <B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">FARMER</FONT></B>  <BR> <BR>Or Simply: <B>DARK PHOENIX&#39;S FARMER</B><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">NOT A TM</FONT></SUP> <BR>NOTE: Other words can be used to substitute the first word, <B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">F</FONT></B>???.... <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think he liked it though. Could it be that phoenixes and farmers don&#39;t go well together? Maybe Farmer Jimbo should consider using this acronym then?
