 An interesting thing happened with my hopper-raising, while I was trying to get the hot springs. I raised a Snow Hopper, for the singular purpose of getting the spring, and getting moves. However, when I went to get him the Withering techs, I found out that there were no techs he could get, as said by the errantry-fellow, whose name escapes me at this moment. So I continued on, and accidently raised him to A-class, rather than B, forgetting hoppers need to be B to dig the spring. And so, I bred him with a Wracky/Bajarl I had around, to get an Emerald Eye. <BR> <BR>However, when I checked my Emerald Eye&#39;s movelist, I discovered that he had the move &#39;Lightning&#39;, and that it was a Withering tech. However, it wasn&#39;t an &#39;evil&#39; tech, or a &#39;good&#39; tech, so I can&#39;t blame it on being locked to a certain attitude. The question now becomes: What was locking it to me with the Snow Hopper? If it&#39;s a crossover tech, then how come the Bajarl cross gets it, when Bajarls have no lightnnig moves? And if it isn&#39;t one, why did the spot say there were no moves to learn at all?

 well, the tech list for hoppers lists lightning as a move all hoppers can get.  i don&#39;t know why your snow hopper didnt have it available at errantry.   <BR> <BR>the second part, what happened with your emerald eye, happens to me a lot.  in fact, my new jilt started with flame, despite the fact that neither of her two mothers, a snowy and a draco doll, had this tech.  i have even had monsters start out their life with a bad tech &#91;golem/thwack&#93; even though its parents didnt have the tech, and even though the infant golem was best natured...sometimes, the game just assigns your newborn techs at the shrine for reasons i dont quite understand. <BR> <BR>anyway, a hopper with lightning is a great opportunity!  usually, a hopper&#39;s aptitude at gaining int goes to waste...but not with your emerald eye.

 I raised 2 hoppers and I&#39;m pretty sure I couldn&#39;t get any tech in the int errantry. Lightning and flame are the 2 techs that still mystify me. I&#39;ve asked people and some tell me they are cross breed with either dragon and pixie while others tell me any hopper can get them. I&#39;ll certainly look closer next time I raise one.

 when i raised my skipper &#40;hopper/tiger&#41; the same thing happened to me i tried to get lightning but i couldn&#39;t then i bred it to a pixie and got a hopper/pixie with the lightning tech. maybe the hopper int techs can only be gotten through breeding instead of the normal errentry way.

 I believe that is so.After combining with my frog hopper it never learned lightning.Then I combined and ...lightning appeared.

 I can tell you for sure that it isn&#39;t just dragon or just pixie. The Hopper/Bajarl got it just fine. It&#39;d be interesting, though, to think that there&#39;s some critters that can only get moves through breeding. This is starting to look like what we&#39;re looking at, with hoppers, anyhow. ANd I still haven&#39;t seen hide nor hare of &#39;Flame&#39;, for that matter.
