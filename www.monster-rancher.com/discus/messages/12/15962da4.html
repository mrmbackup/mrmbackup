 How sucky are gaboos? Well, appaerntly, this section didn&#39;t even have a &#39;create new thread&#39; button. They&#39;re _that_ hated! So why am I writing about them? Hey, someone&#39;s gotta do it, and I _am_ the lover of unloved monsters! <BR> <BR>Seriously, though? Gaboos aren&#39;t as bad as people make them out to be. While they have incredibly LOW numbers in intelligence and skill &#40;two stats that people really depend on&#41;, they are actually rather good in many other areas, including defense &#40;don&#39;t believe me? Try a &#39;swim&#39; drill&#41;, Life &#40;obviously&#41; and power. This makes them not too terribly different from a Golem, all in all, but with better gains in some areas. <BR> <BR>Their attacks are hard to land, but again: golems have the same problem. And where golems have to worry about gettnig hit in the interim, it really isn&#39;t too hard to bring a gaboo&#39;s speed up to &#39;proper&#39; levels, to help it dodge the attacks while you&#39;re waiting for its guts to regen. The regen is somewhat slow, but not so bad as some of the other monster races. I suggest for attacks that you stick with their basic and power techniques for the most part, though _don&#39;t_ ignore their &#39;Long Punch&#39; move. It&#39;s a hit tech from the back row &#40;VERY valuable&#41;, that has an incredible hit rate, and pretty good damage for a hit tech. Combine that with their strength, and you&#39;ve got a rockin&#39; beast, as Ordorf has probably shown a person or two. <BR> <BR>Speaking of the big &#39;O&#39; himself, I&#39;d like to add that the gaboo crossbreeds are even moer handy. Their intelligence is better than the basic gaboo &#40;though they still don&#39;t have as much need for it&#41;, and even their skill &#40;particularly with the Frozen Gaboo and Dokoo&#41; are given a much-needed boost as well.  <BR> <BR>Be afraid, because I think Gaboos haven&#39;t just moved into my &#39;favorite monsters&#39; list &#40;along with hoppers, nitons, and monols&#41;, they&#39;ve actually moved to near the top of it. It&#39;s a challenging monster to raise, but the stat gains make it well worth it. Besides, the mudballs are just plain fun to watch.

 Hey, if KS could love a Gaboo, I could too. :&#41; <BR> <BR>Seriously, I think I&#39;ll raise one in the near future, especially a Dokoo since I&#39;ve got one in one of my CD&#39;s.  It looks cool, very evil looking and muddy &#40;yes, dark muddy ;P&#41;.  Gaboos can be formidable critters if one would raised them carefully to have their skill to the point where it is very devastating.  A maxed out Gaboo in Power, Speed, Life, and Defense &#40;the last 3 being defense related&#41; plus some decent amount of skill stats would make this monster near God-like &#40;if not for its slow guts regeneration -- a Gaboo/Tiger should do the trick&#41;.  Almost all Gaboo types are very good at speed if one would observe them during battles &#40;unlikely for  powerhouse monster types which usually rely on defense instead of speed as primary defense stat&#41;.  But maxing out both speed and defense plus its life would make these monsters very defensive during battle &#40;very good power and intelligence though is needed if one would like these creatures to survive and cushion the blow from the more powerful power/intelligence techniques such as Fire Stream of Phoenixes or Roll Assault of Golems. <BR> <BR>Again, if one would train a Gaboo and patiently make its skill at a very decent level &#40;devastating one&#41; then this critter would be butt kicking time -- slaugthering opponents with the likes of Ninja Kick and its other repetoire of good &#40;and sometimes funny&#41; attacks.

 Zaid...If you want to raise a Gaboo, then the Dokoo would be the one I&#39;d go with. I have raised a Frozen Gaboo &#40;my first monster in fact&#41; but was not very pleased with it. Then again, at that time I was still new and didn&#39;t understand a lot of the nuances of the game.

 Gaboos don&#39;t really need intelligence at all- their only Int-based moves are withering ones, and NASTY Witherers, too.  It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve had my plans messed up by a Gaboo, though &#40;a few months in real life, a few decades in the game&#41;, so I&#39;m starting to hate them less.  Still...the resentment lingers on.

 I&#39;ve been taking a look at the move lists lately, searching for &#34;underappreciated&#34; monsters... and I think the Gaboo may be just what I&#39;m looking for. <BR> <BR>With the right crossbreed, SKI isn&#39;t as crippling a problem as it might seem at first, and with attacks like these: <BR> <BR>Slap &#40;D/A/-/-, POW, 10&#41; <BR>Samurai Kick &#40;C/A/C/D, POW, 30&#41; <BR>Shock Wave &#40;D/A/E/E, POW, 17&#41; <BR>Long Punch &#40;D/S/D/E, POW, 27&#41; <BR>Chop Combo &#40;A/B/D/E, POW, 40&#41; <BR> <BR>...you have a good chance of connecting with POW-damage from three different ranges, without having to work through endless tech-chains.  Throw in: <BR> <BR>Diving Press &#40;D/C/E/C, POW, 18&#41; <BR>Straight &#40;C/D/E/D, POW, 20&#41; <BR>Jumping Chop &#40;C/D/D/B, POW, 28&#41; <BR> <BR>for more damage potential with a decent Skill to back them up, and you&#39;ve got a decent little moveset right there. <BR> <BR>None of the moves are of outlandish cost for a monster with average Guts regen, it&#39;s got good Speed to avoid attacks and good Life to suck them up... <BR> <BR>Of course, I think ColorPandora&#39;s and Zilla&#39;s movesets are underrated, too, so what do I know?  ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Now where did I leave those Henger chips?

 For the record, my first Hall of Famer was a Gaboo.   I&#39;ve raised them and can say the what Kurasu says about them is true.  Actually, the are very easy-going, obedient creatures, just like Wyola at the market says. <BR> <BR>If a trainer can overcome his/her vendetta against Gaboos &#40;courtesy of Oakleyman and Ordorf&#41;, you&#39;ll get the chance to experience raising one of the most underrated monsters in MR2!

 i am now raising a gaboo. <BR> <BR>i consider myself an open-minded, thoughtful person.  yet i have been wrongly prejudiced against gaboos all this time!  i couldn&#39;t have been more wrong! <BR> <BR>they are easy to train, they gain well in all hds except meditate, and they have some very nice attacks.  they have unique and endearing mannerisms, too - they are fun to watch as they meander around the ranch. <BR> <BR>my current frozen gaboo will probably turn out to be combining fodder.  but i hope i get a better gaboo, because i can see now it would be a monster i could easily, and proudly, train to be a champion. <BR> <BR>i hereby apologize to all gaboos everywhere for all the nasty things i&#39;ve said about all y&#39;all.
