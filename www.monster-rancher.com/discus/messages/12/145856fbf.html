 I was wondering...can anyone list down some monster heights for each stage? Like, for example, Monster A        goes up to this part of the window and the middle part of this option bar. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#40;Yikes, this game is old, no one probably plays it anymore, much less post anything here...but I&#39;ll try anyway...it&#39;s just too good!&#41;

 OMG a message from the great admin... <BR> <BR>Yes I&#39;d REALLY love to do something like this... but I haven&#39;t really unlocked everything yet... and the game is kinda old and maybe no one really plays it anymore... aww man... but it&#39;s worth a shot, so I&#39;ll start with the monsters I have.

 I&#39;ve just got back into it, personally o; I started doing a few; at the time, I thought it would be a good idea to measure them up against the drill boxes, but since the camera sometimes changes to make your monsters appear bigger/smaller, I realise I should probably have done it against the stats display &#40;when you press square to view the monster stats, you know?&#41; Anyway, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got. I named them Baby, Teen and Adult to represent the three growths. <BR> <BR>TIGER <BR> <BR>BABY  - Right horn &#40;the player&#39;s right&#41;top  of &#39;Meditate&#39;  <BR>TEEN  - Right horn top of &#39;Pull&#39; <BR>ADULT - Right horn middle of &#39;Run&#39; <BR> <BR>HOPPER <BR> <BR>BABY  - Head is barely at the top of &#39;Meditate&#39; <BR>TEEN  - Head middle of &#39;Pull&#39; <BR>ADULT - Head is top of &#39;Pull&#39; <BR> <BR>CENTUAR <BR> <BR>BABY  - Head top of &#39;Pull&#39; <BR>TEEN  - Head near the middle of &#39;Run&#39; <BR>ADULT - Head near top of &#39;Run&#39; <BR> <BR>I know it&#39;s not much, but I was raising these to be bred and fought, so it took a while. Good luck to you Anzer ;D

 Hmm...I was wondering, would the monster&#39;s sub affect its height at all? Like, if you have a tiger/golem mix, would it be any bigger? I hope not, for simplicity&#39;s sake. ^_^

 No, it doesn&#39;t. That would mean even MORE work for the programmers!

 Yes and no. It doesn&#39;t really affect the GENERAL height. But horns/ears/spears/etc. are marking points for different breeds for those researching on heights. Let&#39;s say, like, the horns are part of the head, but ISN&#39;T the head. Which is why Loserpie &#40;thanks again!&#41; posted the marks of the Tiger&#39;s right horn, instead of the head, because it is easier to spot. Same would someone a Hare&#39;s ears. <BR> <BR>On a side note: Whoever still hates Bobby Fatman, raise your hand! &#42;raises hand&#42;

 So would we need to re-measure it for tigers without horns? Or would the purebreed heights be good enough? Same goes for all monsters with different features. <BR> <BR>Oh, and I read about the Bobby Fatman thing. &#42;raises hand&#42;

 It does? Well, I suppose so. Usually, Jells wouldn&#39;t be much of a problem... I guess. <BR> <BR>JFF: Name your test monster as something like &#34;my &#60;insert private body part here&#62;&#34; or &#34;that &#60;insert swear nouns here&#62;&#34;. Someone made a thread about that years ago, and I still find it funny, for some reason.

 OK, based on what you&#39;ve said, this had better work, Loserpie. <BR> <BR>For now, I haven&#39;t gone very far. Busy with lots of stuff, y&#39;know? Hehe. Suezo goes up to the middle of Speed at the peak of it&#39;s jump.

 You do realize that in drill, the monster occasionally repositions itself, and the best measuring stick is when you feed them against the house? Ie, if you have the best house, you can even read their height against the bricks, which act as counters due to the measuring-stick style of said bricks?  <BR> <BR>	If you were to develop an actual measure, the BEST method would be to take a ruler and count the monster at its LOWEST height, ie, if you have a bouncy one, such as a Suezo, you&#39;d need to count it when its just finished eating and is still, or when its at its lowest, just about to jump.

 Really late reply - went off it and just got back into it again. <BR> <BR>Anzer: I think if the heights were to be recorded, it would have to be objective; probably by the top of the head, rather than an apendage.  <BR> <BR>Oldie: you&#39;re right - the problem is, if you use a ruler, it wouldn&#39;t be the same for every TV.  <BR> <BR>Speaking of which, what WOULD be an objective object to measure it against? It has to be something that doesn&#39;t change - the drill boxes is out, because the camera changes. But the house and stable changes too. So if there was to be a guide, that would have to be taken into account. I don&#39;t pay close attention to the different house changes, so I don&#39;t know whether it changes shape or just colour/textures. Any ideas, anyone..?

 Oh boy, I&#39;m stumped. Sorry I couldn&#39;t really get into this, and if I wasted your time and all, many apologies. Maybe it&#39;s about time we abandon this and simply base it on factual charts...
