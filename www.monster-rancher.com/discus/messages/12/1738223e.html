 Okay, there&#39;s a reason why no one brags about their ultra-Ape in MR2- they&#39;re lazy, disgusting, and &#40;at least initially&#41; seem to lack any decent stats.  Still, after having my Tech List printed out from the Monster Haven sitting in front of me for several months, with the Ape being the first monster shown, my curiousity got the best of me, and I had to try &#39;em.  The results were...interesting. <BR> <BR>First off, the one undisputable thing about Apes is that their lifespan is GREAT.  Right up there with Baku and Kato.  This is important to remember when your Ape is getting crappy stats on its drills for its first few years.  Just like humans, they take awhile to develop.  At full development, however, it may seem like they&#39;re still not all that great- Some slightly above-average Power, low Intelligence, and average in all other stats.  The secret seems to be Heavy Drills and Greats.  While an Ape would only get about 9, 10, or 11 points from a light Power or Defense drill, a Heavy one will net you 19 or 20 points in that stat!  Furthermore, if an Ape does Great at full maturity, there&#39;s about a 95% chance that it will get a maxed-out gain from the drill &#40;unless it&#39;s Intelligence, of course&#41;.  Also, all of this applies to a pure Ape raised to have the Best Nature possible.  If anyone else decides to raise a primate, I&#39;d suggest the Bossy &#40;Ape/Gali&#41;, as it was my biggest money-maker in MR1, and should have no real weakpoints.  The Gali blood will take its lifespan down a ways, but the Ape can handle it. <BR> <BR>The big lifespan is further aided by the lack of difficult-to-earn techniques.  Its only real tech chains are Sneeze -&#62; Blast, Bomb -&#62; Big Bomb, and Grab-Throw -&#62; Swing-Throw &#40;that last one only seems to need about 30 uses to work&#41;.  And if you really decide to ignore an Ape&#39;s Intelligence &#40;I don&#39;t blame you&#41;, you don&#39;t really need to work the first two chains.  All of this means that even an amateur could easily pick up all of an Ape&#39;s moves and still have a LONG lifespan to earn stats with &#40;someone using DP&#39;s method might be able to max out a first-gen Ape, all things considered&#41;.  The only difficulty is that Big Bomb and Blast are Baddie Techs, while Tasty Banana is a Good Tech, and a Bad-Natured Ape can be a real handfull.  If an experienced trainer is raising an Ape, however, it could come out like this... <BR> <BR>Maya <BR>Gold Ape &#40;Ape/???&#41;&#42; <BR> <BR>7 years, 10 months old, all techniques learned. <BR> <BR>Lif: 800&#43; <BR>Pow: 800&#43; <BR>Int: 400&#43; <BR>Ski: 750&#43; <BR>Spd: 700&#43; <BR>Def: 750&#43; <BR> <BR>Likes: Nate/Cup Jelly <BR>Dislikes: Potato <BR> <BR>She has won three of the M4, is waiting in the freezer for the last one and the Legends Cup.  Since it&#39;s been half a year since I created this save file, I can&#39;t remember what generation she is. <BR> <BR>Battle Strategies: Most likely your Ape will be a Power-based monster, or in some cases, it might be an even split between Power and Intelligence.  If you&#39;re of the first variety, you may be dismayed that the Ape&#39;s Hit Techs are Int-based, but don&#39;t worry- its Basic Techs can easily make up for &#39;em.  Speaking of which, the Ape&#39;s Thwack is probably the best Basic move in the game &#40;C/B/E/- for 16&#41;, and is certainly the most painful-looking.  Even if you&#39;re Pow-oriented, I&#39;ve found that catching an opponent with a Sneeze or Blast really increases the success rate of your next move if you follow it within a few seconds of the Withering, which is the perfect oppurtunity to smash &#39;em with Grab-Throw, Swing-Throw, or Roll Assault.  Thwack and Slap also make good lead-in moves, and the best thing about an Ape is how low-cost its moves are, so feel free to Combo King away.  With the Ape&#39;s Power, it shouldn&#39;t take more than two or three hits &#40;or just a single Swing-Throw&#41; to KO an opponent.  If you make your Ape capable of Int-based moves, you can also go with an Antagonizer strategy &#40;an Ape/Plant works great with this due to increase Guts Regen, Intelligence, and Skill&#41;.  Use a few Sneezes and Blasts, and then fall back on Big Banana, Big Bomb, or regular Bomb.  All of these have LONG animations, and are great for running out the clock on an opponent who&#39;s trying to make a come-back.  Beating an Ape is actually a bigger problem than you would think- while that C-rank wuss is no need for concern and can be trashed any way you please, the King Ape could be a real problem &#40;if you find it&#41;.  It&#39;s just as well that you can&#39;t control your monster, because there is no real safe ground- each range on an Ape is equipped with a technique for good damage and one for good accuracy &#40;in the case of Mid-range, the two are combined into Thwack&#41;.  If you&#39;re a Speed Demon confronting another player&#39;s Ape, however, keeping off in far-range works pretty well as long as their Intelligence isn&#39;t too high &#40;and if you&#39;re using a Pixie, Tiger, Kato, etc., you can easily shrug off an Int-based Hit Tech&#41;.  Tanks have nowhere to turn- each range is armed with a potentially devastating Pow-based move except mid-range, and even there you&#39;ll have to deal with Thwack and Blast- the second of which can incapacitate a Golem or Baku for half the fight.  Your best bet against a tough Ape is to take the initiative and just pound on them with your best moves- an Antagonizer strategy won&#39;t work too well considering their array of inexpensive moves, so you&#39;ll have to try for a One-Hit Wonder.  Hope you&#39;ve got a nasty Int-based manuever ready. <BR> <BR>For style, the Ape is sure to get mixed reviews.  Personally, I think Big Banana is absolutely hilarious in a Monty Python sort of way.  For some of its other moves, however...well, if you&#39;re into toilet humor, you&#39;ll love the way it drags its butt across the ground everywhere, sneezes, farts, flicks explosive boogers, etc.  More mature people will be disgusted, although there still is something kind of funny about your monster rooting around in its nose, flicking its find, and creating a massive explosion from it.  On the farm, an Ape just seems to be outright boring, though- no cool/cute/interesting animations/sounds, aside from when it slacks off and uses the supersized banana as a beanbag chair.  If you&#39;re a lover of unloved monsters...well, you can probably go without raising these things, because there&#39;s a REASON people stay away from them.  If you&#39;re looking for something really interesting, this also isn&#39;t the monster for you.  But if you want to raise something with no real weaknesses, even if it means no real strengths, then this IS the monster for you.

 nate if the ape is a /??? type it has to be first gen cause you can&#39;t get ??? from combining unless you use a dna capsule and even then there isn&#39;t a dna capsule for a gold ape
