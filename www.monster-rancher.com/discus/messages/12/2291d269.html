 This title refers to how, in one way or another, I had problems with each of the critters reviewed here &#40;not counting the ones that I just reference or point to reviews of&#41;.  This does not necessarily mean that they&#39;re poor fighters, but still- buyer beware! <BR> <BR>&#42;Suezo- Leading the pack is one of the series&#39; mascot monsters, which might have the dangerous potential to turn people off from the game before they even get into it.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, these things RULE in Intelligence, and have some pretty nice Skill and good Power.  However, Life, Defense, and Speed are all below-average &#40;and Guts Regen is dead-average&#41;, meaning that you either need a good sub-breed or a very offense-oriented strategy to win.  Right off the bat, you have to realize that no one move is going to get you through fights by itself.  Suezos have very easy-to-collect moves &#40;only one tech chain, no breed-specific or nature-specific moves&#41;, so take advantage of this and be sure to load up, as most of them make valuable additions to your arsenal, and the ones that don&#39;t &#40;Telepathy&#41; will stand in the way of others until you get them.  The odd thing here is that while the Suezo&#39;s Withering moves are sub-par &#40;D-rank accuracy on both&#41;, all of the Suezo&#39;s attacks have at least D-rank Withering &#40;except for its Basic moves, which at least have &#34;E&#34; in that stat&#41;.  That being the case, you can chip at your opponent&#39;s Guts at the same time you slash at their HP, making a well-used Suezo a nightmare for Durahans, Dragons, and other Tanks that miss with their opening bid.  However, unless you choose certain sub-types, your Guts Regen won&#39;t be high enough to rattle of several attacks with ease, so it&#39;s all the more important to select which moves to use in which occasions.  Unfortunately, Suezo&#39;s Hit Techs don&#39;t do much damage for all their hyper-accuracy, and Heavy and Sharpness techs don&#39;t have much accuracy for their relatively low force.  If you&#39;ve chosen a more Power-oriented eyeball, you CAN have a lot of fun with Chewing, and combining it with almost any low-cost most will ensure a quick victory.  Still, even for a master rancher, using a Suezo is often a gamble, and facing an enemy Suezo is a pretty easy win.  Those generally-low defensive stats say it all- if a Suezo&#39;s opponent gets first strike, the effects can be devastating, and may end the fight before it even really begins.  If you&#39;re attacking one, just assault it immediately with some harsh moves &#40;although be careful against Speed-based ones&#41;, and you&#39;ll have no problem.  Let them linger on the battlefield, and they could Antagonize you into a slow, bitter defeat. <BR> <BR>&#42;Dragon- Another big favorite gets its due, and is actually oddly similar to the Suezo in its own way.  How?  They&#39;re both offense-oriented monsters.  Sure, the Dragon may get a good chunk of Defense to ward off attacks, and when it&#39;s supported by its high Power and Intelligence &#40;and maybe a little extra layer of Fat&#41;, it can certainly take attacks better than the little one-eyed freaks.  However, its Defense and Life pale in comparison to Baku, Golem, and the like, so can&#39;t sit back with as safe of prospects.  Its Speed is a little better to make up for this, though, and Skill is at least average, but they&#39;re counterbalanced by a very low lifespan and the WORST GUTS REGEN IN THE GAME.  Maybe this isn&#39;t technically true, and maybe something else is actually slower than it, but nothing FEELS as achingly snail-paced as watching your Dragon try to come back from missing with a high-powered attack.  Finding the right sub-breed can help a lot, though, and something like a Gidras &#40;Dragon/Metalner&#41; can be incredibly powerful &#40;and cool-looking&#41; by virtue of its improved Guts Regen and GREAT list of moves.  In general, you can&#39;t go wrong, but you should probably avoid working for Two Bites unless you&#39;re a tech perfectionist.  Every single other move the wyrms can wield make great weapons, and the additional good news is that only 2 of them are Special Techs, meaning that several generations of Dragons can easily pass on their technique lists from one generation to the next virtually intact!  As for the moves themselves...where &#40;or should&#41; I begin?  Flutter is a killer Hit Tech, and its improved version can work as a surprisingly inexpensive One-Hit Wonder technique.  The Tail and Wing attacks make good Power substitutes for them, while Glide Charge, Slamming Down, Dragon Punch, and Inferno make nice all-around moves.  Fire Breath is good for scorching slow-moving targets, but not much else, and Claw Combo seems to never connect even against the dopiest foes, though, so watch out.  Of course, Trample, Flying Combo, and Dragon Combo can finish off slowpokes in a single smash.  Getting the idea here?  The key to winning with a Dragon is SKILL.  It&#39;s not their best trait, but it&#39;s their most important one.  If you need to, slack off on Power and Intelligence a little to get Skill up to descent levels, because trust me, the Dragons&#39; attack have enough raw force to make up for it.  If a Dragon uses up all his Guts with misses, however, it&#39;s all over for the beast.  A smart opponent &#40;or Most&#41; can constantly pound you with lightly-withering moves to keep your guts down, while chipping away just enough HP to win easily.  If you&#39;re facing a Dragon, this is also the best way to go- try to goad them into blowing off an unsuccessful assault as their opening move, and then never let them come back from it.  Even the badboys like Lagirus &#40;is that his name?&#41; and Zelandia won&#39;t be able to beat you if you play on their own hot-headedness.  Watch out for delivering too brutal of attacks, though- if you make fools out of them, you&#39;re bound to drive them into a full-blown Rage, and god help you if you incite a Dragon&#39;s ire. <BR> <BR>&#42;Henger- Another monster with an offense-oriented attack strategy and tons of moves to choose from.  Unfortunately, it carries the low natural defensive stats of Suezo, so you&#39;ll need a proper sub-breed to succeed &#40;not the Joker one, no matter how cool it looks- it&#39;s just not worth the trouble in this case&#41;.  The Henger also doesn&#39;t have any one super stat like the Suezo&#39;s smarts or the Dragon&#39;s strength, but it does pretty well in all offensive areas and has some slightly-above-average Guts Regen to go with it.  Since most of its moves are Pow-based, many people elect to make a heavily Pow-based Henger, but doing so denies you the full potential of some of its great Int-based moves like Napalm Shot, Eye Beam, and the debiliating Sound Wave &#40;B accuracy, B withering, 25 cost.  Woo-hoo!  For evil robots only, though&#41;.  Napalm Shot is especially a good deal in that it has the C-Force and S-Accuracy of some of your favorite moves &#40;Kato&#39;s Twister Claw, Dragon&#39;s Flutter, etc.&#41;, but it only costs 24 Guts instead of 30!  You can ignore Burst Cannon, though, as well as Arm Cannon once you have Napalm capabilities.  Still, the robots&#39; Power attacks are nothing to be dismissed, either.  Yoyo makes a nice, solid Withering move &#40;D/C/C/D for 17&#41;.  Fist Missile is a great Speedster-slammer &#40;D/A/E/B for 19&#41;, the Drill Shot series make good overall attacks.  Sledge Fall and Laser Cutter are good for cutting through tough-skinned opponents &#40;although Hammer Fall and Two Cutters leave something to be desired&#41;.  Of course, perhaps nothing except Death Final can match the pure slowpoke-shredding terror that is Laser Swords.  You&#39;ll have to work harder than for the Joker&#39;s super move, but the Henger&#39;s top attack does pack better accuracy and sharpness, along with the Henger&#39;s own naturally-high Skill.  Don&#39;t worry about its Basic Tech chains- there&#39;s no real point.  Anyway, with all these great choices, it&#39;s hard to give good advice on how best to handle a Henger- it really varies from model to model, trainer to trainer.  The one constant, though, is be aggressive.  In general, these robo-soldiers can&#39;t hold out forever on the battlefield, so you have to take down the enemy first.  And if you&#39;re battling a Henger, the same thing applies.  Once again, be aggressive and you can probably drop them without too much trouble &#40;none of the computer-controlled ones have any defensive stats over 500&#41;.  Hang back, and even a superior monster of yours could be comboed into submission by precision attacks. <BR> <BR>&#42;Arrowhead- NO!  Not ANOTHER monster boasting a huge move list!  Particularly not one with lots of Cross-over attacks and Nature-specific moves!  &#42;Groan&#42; Well, at least it has more lifespan to handle them...as well as some truly solid Defense and Life, which is something I really missed on the last three.  Of course, it counters this with low natural Power, and mediocre Intelligence.  Skill is pretty good, though, and Speed isn&#39;t as low as expected.  Neither is Guts Regen.  So maybe there&#39;s hope after all.  Where to begin?  Well, first off, unlike Henger and Dragon, this monster&#39;s stat make-up really only allows for high Power or Intelligence, but not both.  The first path, once again, boasts the majority of moves, while the second path has several hard-to-deny attacks like Triple Stings, Meteor, and Energy Shot.  The last is particularly useful, knocking off C-rank Guts for A-rank accuracy at the cost of only 18 of your own Guts, and its bigger version is actually useful, too!  However, the Arrowhead might not a high enough Guts Regen rate to make full use of these, and if you chose a Durahan or Golem sub-type, it&#39;s pretty much out of the question.  Out of its Power techniques, your best bets are Somersault, Somersaults, Long Punch, Claw Pinch, Tail Swings, Aerobatics, and Hidden Sting.  The rest have only debateable usefulness, whether because of no real strong points &#40;Jumping Claw, Javelin&#41;, being able to find a cheaper move with the same stats easier &#40;Tail Swing, Fist Missle&#41;, or just plain costing too much for too little &#40;Death Scythe, Sting Slash&#41;.  Of course, it&#39;s often fun to see what these moves look like, at least &#40;Death Scythe, being a Joker Cross-Over tech, is particularly eerie, and Fist Missile is kind of cool as a Henger crossover move&#41;.  When it comes down to battling, a well-equipped Arrowhead should be lucky enough to take advantage of almost any attack strategy, and it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to take down the right monsters with the right moves: You know the drill, Heavy techs for Tanks, Hit Techs for Speedsters, etc.  Dealing with enemy Arrowheads can be difficult, though.  Sure, the first one you meet isn&#39;t too tough, but your A-class and S-class computer opponents can be difficult by virtue of their unusually well-balanced, high stats.  You&#39;ll probably be forced to play into your weaknesses to beat them- Tanks will have to use Hit Techs, Speedsters will have to use Heavy Techs.  Antagonizers can use their normal strategies for battle, though, and Combo Kings won&#39;t have hardly any trouble at all, as long as they don&#39;t drop too low in Guts. <BR> <BR>WHEW!  Two more monsters left to go...Worm and Monol.  Along with them, I might provide some extra updates on some of the creatures I&#39;ve reviewed in the past.  While I feel that I did pretty good with some of the first ones, like Joker, several of the others feel like there&#39;s something missing.  So, are there any other creatures that you want me to take a second look at, now that I&#39;ve nearly finished?

 Stupid computer crash!  I&#39;ll try to remember what all I was saying... <BR> <BR>Anyway, I forgot about advice on positioning if/when you need to hunker down on defensive and regenerate Guts.  This might have been because with Arrowhead, there ISN&#39;T any good place.  A well-equipped one of these should have an array of high-damage and high-accuracy moves in each range.  Fortunately, there is a loophole when battling the computer- it tends to use Punch and Claw Assault way more than it should, and even a Speedster can withstand a few of these &#40;if it can&#39;t, you really need some more Defense and Life&#41;. <BR> <BR>With the Dragon, you run into much the same problem as a Speedster- there&#39;s nowhere to run!  However, if the monster is too Bad-Natured to have ever gotten Glide Charge &#40;like Zelandia&#41;, make a beeline for the back row and stay there.  It&#39;s safest to keep the Dragon&#39;s Guts as low as possible, though, and just stay out of Short Range &#40;where all the low-cost Basic Techs are&#41;.  A Tank should take the opposite strategy- holding on to Short Range as firmly as possible, and not letting the Dragon push or pull away into any of the other ranges, from wence it may smite thee freaking hard. <BR> <BR>Once again, a tricked-out Henger can terrorize a Speed Demon, but standing at Mid-Range &#40;2nd&#41; severely ups your chances of survival- its most accurate attack at that range is Yoyo, with only C-grade accuracy and laughable damage &#40;although the Withering still might pose a problem if it connects with a lucky shot&#41;.  Tanks can also easily handle the robots- stay as in-close as possible to avoid nasty moves like the Laser blade attacks.  It&#39;s okay if it pushes you back out, as long as you can greet it with your own Far-reaching attack as soon as it pulls back into range. <BR> <BR>Despite its high Skill, Suezo is actually easier to face with Speedsters- staying really in-close protects you from most attacks, and if it pushes you away, it can&#39;t hit you very easily in Far-range either.  Tanks have the biggest problem, what with the one-eye&#39;s Antagonizing tendencies, so like I said before, it&#39;s best to strike first and ask questions later.
