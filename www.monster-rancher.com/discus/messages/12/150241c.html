People have said many times that to make a monster have a long and successful life, you should use Dark Phoenix&#39;s or RNA&#39;s method. People make such a big deal about getting long lived and prosperous monsters without a method. Well, if accomplishing the above is a major feat, then i beleive i have mastered this game. Many, many times i have raised monsters to live in an excess of 10 years, including my infamous golem Nats who lived over 20 years, even though most people don&#39;t beleive that nats even existed, let alone lived 23 years. Although Nats was a great feat, i must say, this will come as a shock to you all: I have beaten Nats&#39;s record. My newest monster, an Ebony &#40;Mock/Joker&#41; lived in an excess of 25 years. for the exact age, you must be willing to take the truth, so i ask that you e-mail me privatly at <A HREF="mailto:rapman243@aol.com">rapman243@aol.com</A> for the exact life span. Note that this was acheived without RNA&#39;s or Dark Phoenix&#39;s methods. I have been using my own method all along. I posted a minor method on this board awhile back, but was deleted in the Bobby Fatman episode. My new method i have revealed to only the people who i see as worthy and trustable friends, the people who won&#39;t let this slip, for it is a great secret which i must keep. If you desire the ultimate raising method, e-mail me at the address below. thank you for your time.  <BR> <BR>-- golem man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rapman243@aol.com">rapman243@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 23, 2000  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>watch ur language people, or the mighty B will come down off his thrown to punish u &#40;that may sound like i am insulting B but i am not&#41; athough, golem man, it is rather hard to believe....although....i believe u, mocks have a long lifespan don&#39;t they.....  <BR> <BR>-- lovesaurian &#40;<A HREF="mailto:girlsaurian@yahoo.com">girlsaurian@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, March 23, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>yes!! someone believes me!! thank you!!!  <BR> <BR>-- golem man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rapman243@aol.com">rapman243@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 23, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>there&#39;s a guy here in michigan named mitch rompola&#91;sp?&#93;. he claimed to have killed a record buck. but he wouldn&#39;t let anyone test it, and became abusive to those who wanted to give it the standard testing before taking his word for it. eventually, it was not certified as a record, and mitch was left to mutter darkly about conspiracies and &#34;the establishment&#34;. unfortunately, whether or not he actually had taken the buck, he is now regarded by the majority as a fraud.  <BR>unfortunately for you, golem man, that is your reputation on this board. you may not care, and you may actually have raised two 23&#43; year old monsters, but until you open yourself up for verification - what were the starting stats? what raising method did you use? how many errantries? expeditions? peaches? magic bananas? etc - i am with the skeptics.  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, March 23, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>ok, someone tell me how to take screen shots AND I WILL GLADLY PROVE IT!!!!  <BR> <BR>-- golem man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rapman243@aol.com">rapman243@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 23, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>no, i prefer the explanation.  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, March 23, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>fine  <BR> <BR>-- golem man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rapman243@aol.com">rapman243@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 23, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Nats: &#40;Golem&#41; Beginning Stats: Life-216 Power-256 Int.-110 Ski.-145 Spd.-76 Def.212 Peaches-1 gold, 1 silver expeditions-none errantries-7 raising method-as posted M.B.-30, more or less  <BR>Dark Wood &#40;Ebony&#41; Starting Stats- Lif. 245 Pow. 136 Int. 269 Ski. 179 Spd. 130 Def. 176 Errantries-4 Peaches-1gold 1 silver M.B.-45, more or less Method-Self Devised  <BR> <BR>There, happy torey luvullo? hope your satisfied By the way, i couldn&#39;t remember the exact number of majic bannanas for either of them.  <BR> <BR>-- golem man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rapman243@aol.com">rapman243@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 23, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Just out of curiosity, what did Colt sing for its birthday?

Name- Trunker Current stats- 237 lif, 112 pow, 221 int, 128 ski, 98 spd, 110 defense. he has been raised well so far, but i am tipically tough on monsters during their infant stages, as strange as it sounds, but it gets they&#39;re loyalty up decently fast. The last few months i&#39;ve been drilling him typically in ski. and defense, since they both started out poor. Until he is about a year old, i will train him every week, giving him nuts oil every other week to relieve stress, as well as mint leaves every non-nuts oil week. When he is exactly 1 year old, i will send him on the 1st errantry to learn twig gattling. He is now only 2 months away from the first official tourney, which i will enter him in. I fed him tablets every week, and so far he has never failed a drill or played truant, cheated, etc. He has never gotten stressed, or really even tired. The only time i have rested him so far is the first two weeks i got him, but with a NO every oter week, rest is almost completely unneccessary, though i do occasionally rest him after a tourney. he has had no special requests so far, and he likes tablets, and dislikes smoked snakes. i will update every other day on Trunkey&#39;s proggresion from here on out.  <BR> <BR>-- Golem Man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rapman243@aol.com">rapman243@aol.com</A>&#41;, March 23, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Why don&#39;t you just take a pic of the screen of your TV &#40;no flash&#41; scan it then e-mail it to those you give a damn then all who care are happy or get a dex drive and send it to people that way.

It has become very famous in its attempt to deceive us. Torey seems to enjoy this &#34;Bad&#34; attempt to do so cause he always seems to bring it up to amuse us. How do you expect to deceive us when you have no idea how you would be able to train a monster to such a high lifespan?  <BR>&#34;you must be willing to take the truth&#34; - golem man.  <BR> <BR>I distinctly recall you &#34;lying&#34; about the amount of techs your golem had. 27 was it? Then it became 24... but golems only have 22 techs. After that, you said it had all of them. Maybe this isn&#39;t lying rather, it is miscalculation.  <BR> <BR>What about the time when you &#34;protected&#34; the site from the hacker on the condition that Eagle Fierce would believe your alleged 23 year old golem? I remember when you posted under a different identity in which you were swearing at us because your duo-identity, the supposed &#34;hacker&#34;, had his monitor blown to pieces because of your &#34;protection&#34;. Then, B campbell posted a message saying that your IP and the &#34;supposed hacker&#39;s&#34; IP were the same - and called you a weirdo at the same time. Apparently, you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about when it comes to hacking. The best that any average hacker could do, given my limited knowledge of hacking, would be to set up firewalls or break them down, not blow up a monitor. Besides, Bobby Fatman was NOT a hacker because he did not hacking to gain access into this site. Like B campbell said, he simply stumbled upon a back door.

Golem Man wasn&#39;t Bobby Fatman, he just posed as a Bobby Fatman wan&#39;-a-be, then posted a message saying that his monitor blew up because of Golem Man&#39;s&#40;his true self&#41; awesome ability at hacking. However, this doesn&#39;t rule out the possibility of Golem Man actually being Bobby Fatman, but I doubt it. I still don&#39;t know Bobby&#39;s true identity. You&#39;re not alone, Vheod.  <BR> <BR>B Campbell, this was when Lisa took over for her first time. Then everything looked hunky dorey&#40;spelled right?&#41; especially when you started posting again. I don&#39;t remember the name of the thread, but I believe it had some profanity in it. The thread was by Golem Man, but he posed as the fake hacker&#40;I don&#39;t remember exact name used but the name was not Bobby Fatman&#41;. The first answer in that thread, was by Golem Man&#40;same name&#41;, in which he was boasting about his talented hacking skills. The third answer in that thread, was B campbell. You noted that the above post and the original question were both posted under the same IP - then you called him a weirdo.  <BR> <BR>Shortly after, the board was taken over by Bobby Fatman again. All which was recently posted, was then erased. So there&#39;s no evidence of all this happening except from my memories and possibly that of Eagle Fierce&#40;Where is that guy?&#41; as well.  <BR> <BR>I think Golem Man&#39;s excuse for not protecting the site when Bobby took over again, was because nobody believed in his 23 year old Golem. I&#39;m not too sure about this one, but I know there was an excuse.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, March 28, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Oh yeah, I remember Golem Man&#39;s fake identity getting shards of broken monitor glass stuck in his face.

 Keep in mind people that if ANYONE tries to pull the con of a 23-year-old monster, screen shots aren&#39;t a definitive answer.  There are gameshark codes available with all the rest that let you hack the monster&#39;s listed age.

 Agreed, Nate.  With my Gameshark Memory Editor and my knowledge of some of the key memory locations in MR2, I could fake a screen shot of a 23 year old Golem with unbearable ease and no one would be the wiser.

 For those of us without the technical gameshark know-how, there&#39;s another easy way... A quick framegrab, a bit of cut and paste with good graphics software, and the same effect is achieved graphically.  This can be done without any programming or gamecode skills.

 Absolutely!...the only way to prove a theory scientifically, is to provides the means &#40;method&#41; so that others can reproduce the results themselves...otherwise, these claims are no better  than that Black Hole i made in my basement that I won&#39;t let any of my friends look at...well, never mind about that...this secretive &#34;I&#39;ll email you my method if I can trust you&#34;...is B.S.
