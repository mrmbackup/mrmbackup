I did many experiments. I am now in year 1432...and still no undine and niton. the diffrence is: when i win a battle, if the bonus is too small &#40;below 10&#41;, or in a stat that i dont want &#40;ex: i want bonus in ski, pow and speed&#41;, i will reload the game and enter the battle again.  <BR> <BR>in my inventory,, i keep 3 gemini pots, 3 sculptures, 3 dino&#39;s tails. i believe, from my experiment, that dino tails reduce stress alot.  <BR> <BR>i just sold the lump of ice, etc cause the stamina can rejuvenate with the help of nuts oil. if the monster has rested in the last week, the next month i give: &#40;applecake, nutsoil, nutsoil, mintleaf&#41;. if not: &#40;nutsoil, mintleaf, nutsoil, mintleaf&#41;. at prime condition: when after &#40;frozen.battle,frozen.battle...&#41; when after battle: -seems weel--nuts oil -well-mint leaf  <BR> i also give troron alot when my monster is still a baby and do easy drills.  <BR>ciao...  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, December 25, 1999  <BR>Just a few small points: 1&#41; sculpture is for fatigue not stress, so if you truly want to focus on stress items dump the statues and get three more pots. 2&#41; I understand why you would want to reset if you are maxed out, but many see this as cheating. to them I sugest stoping around 800 so that you wont go over &#40;more or less depending on if you want to do errentries in that stat or you use hard drills incorperating that stat&#41; 3&#41; giving a mint leaf after battle is fairly pointless. Battles reduce stress a bunch, probabbly more than mint leaves do anyway. I generally give nuts oil regardless, but if you want to save it only for seems well weeks try a mango or candy or nothing at all, all the mint leaf is doing at that point is reducing your loyalty by a point. 4&#41; while it may eventualy be proved that some drugs are cost effective &#40;i.e. the life loss is worth the boost&#41; I&#39;m keeping away from this current trend for the time being. besides, with my intensive battling I shave more than enough off my beasties lives, thats just my personal taste though.  <BR> <BR>-- WildCard &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rincewind@uswest.net">rincewind@uswest.net</A>&#41;, December 25, 1999.  <BR> <BR>Unless mitigated by other items, Troron reduces your monster&#39;s lifespan by 10 weeks. How did you got your monster&#39;s to live so long while using Troron?  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 26, 1999.  <BR> <BR>With the use of troron&#40;s&#41;, you shaved off 2 yrs or so off your phoenix. And with that, your phoenix still looks good. I&#39;d like to see what it would look like if paradoxine was used instead.  <BR>Onomiba, I was just wondering if you have found a way to successfully carry out: &#40;HardDrill,HardDrill,HardDrill,HardDrill&#41; &#40;item,item,item,item&#41;. I am currently working on this so that I can get the ultimate training style.  <BR>- thanks Onomiba &#91;Onomiba: you&#39;re welcome&#93;  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, December 26, 1999.  <BR> <BR>i didn&#39;t do: harddrill,harddrill,harddrill,hardrill  <BR>for the first 7 months &#40;sometimes 5&#41; i do shoot,shoot,shoot,shoot with item&#40;nutsoil,mintleaf,nutsoil,mintleaf&#41; next, i do hardrill,hardrill,harddrill,shoot with item&#40;nutsoil,nutsoil,nutsoil,mintleaf&#41;  <BR>does troron really shorten your lifespan?  <BR>i raised a ducklon &#40;beaclon/ducken, he is cute&#41;, now he is at his 6th birthday but colt didn&#39;t say to consider his retirement. I gave him no troron, or maybe i gave him to much sleep -  his stats at 2 years 1 month: 572lif 702pow 56int 270ski 1spd 802def. after that, i just gave him mansseiten&#40;forget how to spell it&#41; and told him to sleep, and only battled in ima official cups &#40;to increase his ski&#41;. now his stats are: 998lif 843pow 56int 693ski 1spd 823def &#40;look at his int, i reset the game when he got bonus points at int!&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, December 28, 1999.  <BR> <BR>for dark phoenix: i combined those monster with plant disc chip, and i used a gold peach.  <BR>&#40;but for phoenix, i like to combine them with hopper disc: grit! grit! grit! yeah...zombie phoenix&#41; but, i still wonder, is there a special time to use hopper disc? sometimes my phoenix never got grit?  <BR>for RNA: i remember i used to raise a henger with pull,leap,pull,leap, but he didn&#39;t last long ---maybe only 4years,8 months. &#40;he beat the legend cup for the second or or third time for me: eat my laser sword white mocchi!&#41;  <BR>for everyone: what is real, vigor, fight, etc?  <BR>troron reduces lifespan? i still don&#39;t believe it...my poor phoenix...i killed him softly...  <BR>&#40;sorry for my horrible english, i&#39;m an Indonesian, and the english courses here suck&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, December 28, 1999.  <BR> <BR>Anything that says Medicine or Stimulant is a drug &#40;troron, kassetan, mansetan, whatever&#41; and therefore DOES have a negative impact on lifespan. However, under certain conditions the benefits outweigh the costs &#40;see the threads specificaly dealing with Troron and paradoxtrin for more info&#41;.  <BR> <BR>-- WildCard &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rincewind@uswest.net">rincewind@uswest.net</A>&#41;, December 28, 1999.  <BR> <BR>I found out the Phoenixs can live 8&#43; years under proper raising and your use of Troron reduced its lifespan to about 5&#43; years. In the proper hands, Troron isn&#39;t all bad. Your phoenix was shorter lived than RNA&#39;s phoenix but are very similar in stats. All in all, a very good style. Just don&#39;t expect to make the Elder&#39;s Cup.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 28, 1999.  <BR> <BR>Check out &#34;Report on the effect of TRORON&#34; and &#34;Drug Report: PARADOXINE&#34; for more info on those drugs. If you used paradoxine instead of troron, your phoenix would have 200 - 400 pts more in its stats. It is much more powerful.  <BR>Our phoenix&#39;s are quite similar in stats but mine lived longer. If you had used Paradoxine, your phoenix would have much higher stats.  <BR>I also find that using &#40;HardTrain,HardTrain,HardTrain,HardTrain&#41; drains alot of lifespan. Maybe it&#39;s just not possible?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, December 29, 1999.  <BR> <BR>Looks like the idea of 4 Hard Drills/month&#39;s gonna have to be abandoned. I&#39;ve tried everything and hit the blinds everytime.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, December 29, 1999.  <BR> <BR>new: my ninja kato&#40;kato/???&#41; trains as follows: meditate,leap,meditate,leap,meditate,leap,meditate,sleep from the 7 month, with item &#40;applecake, mintleaf, nutsoil, mintleaf, nutsoil, mintleaf, nutsoil, applecake&#41;. it died when it was 4 years 11 months. i used no gold peach.  <BR>my satan clause&#40;wracky/???&#41; did the same thing, but i replaced the apple cake with mango, cause he didn&#39;t like the apple cake&#40;loyalty down&#41;. it died when it was 4 years 5 months.  <BR>compare those ages with my previous henger! it is possible if special monsters &#40;.../???&#41; have longer lifespans?  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, December 29, 1999.  <BR> <BR>Aren&#39;t ninja katos and satan clauses supposed to have really long lifespans? Maybe this 4HT training style is draining ALOT of lifespan...  <BR>Did you use paradoxines/trorons?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, December 30, 1999.  <BR> <BR>i didn&#39;t use paradoxine and troron. and i did&#39;t use gold peach either for the ninja kato and satan clause  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, December 31, 1999.  <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t use the &#40;HardTrain,HardTrain,HardTrain,HardTrain&#41; pattern. It will drastically lower your lifespan. It may be impossible to do. Don&#39;t do &#40;HardTrain,HardTrain,HardTrain,LightTrain&#41; as well.  <BR>That&#39;s probably why your lifespan for those monsters are so low.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, December 31, 1999.  <BR> <BR>gee...for my new metal glory&#40;fourth generation&#41;, i did hardrillx3, and he lived for 6 years 8 months &#40;is that short?&#41; i combined a metal glory&#40;third generation&#41; with a ducklon&#40;6th generation&#41;, used 1 golden peach,and the stats are following: 999lif,999pow,867int,999ski,532spd,999def &#40;i just remember that he started with a very good stat &#40;lif, power, ski and def above 500&#41;. he is still alive now, and at the 6th birthday, colt didn&#39;t tell me to retire him.  <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, January 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Good job on your Metal glory. That&#39;s 5395 total points! Now there&#39;s a challenge. I&#39;ll have to try beating that sometime.  <BR>My 3rd gen metal glory lived for 7yrs 7m. It depends on how you raise it I guess. However, if your method is similar to my method except the fact that I only use &#40;HardTrain,HardTrain,HardTrain,rest&#41;, then we must start wondering. My metal glory has about 4 - 6 months left to live. Did you use trorons/paradoxines? Did you do excessive battling? what was your battle record? is he slowing down now?  <BR>I didn&#39;t know you could get over 500&#43; in a stat after combining. I&#39;ve never seen that before.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>try to combine metalglory&#43;beacklon/dragon&#40;betellguess..or something&#41; metalglory&#43;pure durahan metalglory&#43;ducklon try to make it become metal glory&#40; the combined monster must be in the high class &#41;, use crabs claw, to often give best or good combo!  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, January 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>i didnt use any troron/paradoxine  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, January 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>There &#34;probably&#34; 2 possible reasons for your Metal Glory&#39;s short lifespan.  <BR>1&#41; Too many battles.  <BR>2&#41; The extra shoot drill at the end of the month has used up your existing life energy.  <BR>What is your battle record?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>154win/142KO, 2L  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, January 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>My 3rd gen metal glory had a record of 132W 0L 118KO. It lived to be 7yrs 7m old.  <BR>Your 4th gen metal glory had a record of 154W 0L 142KO. It lived to be 6yrs 8m old.  <BR>Now this is VERY interesting!  <BR>Our battle records are about the same so it is safe to say that both our metal glories have participated in approximately the same amount of tournies.  <BR>However, your metal glory was trained with &#40;HardTrain,HardTrain,HardTrain,LighTrain&#41; and it lived for 6yrs 8m old.  <BR>My metal glory was trained with &#40;HardTrain,HardTrain,HardTrain,rest&#41; and it lived for 7yrs 7m oldm and with approx. 4 months left to live.  <BR>1 of 2 things may be the result of your metal glory&#39;s short lifespan &#40;assuming our raising methods are approx. constant&#41;:  <BR>1&#41; It is impossible to keep form at normal with your method of &#40;HardTrain,HardTrain,HardTrain,LighTrain&#41;. Therefore, your metal glory&#39;s skinniness may have contributed to its short lifespan. I kept my metal glory at normal form at all times.  <BR>2&#41; Your use of 3HT and a light train on the 4th month may follow my theory. My theory suggests that a monster has a certain amount of turns. If you are using 4 turns per month instead of 3 turns, then you are simply using up the turns faster and that would mean a shorter lifespan.  <BR>However, I am starting to believe that my theory is just a side- effect of what I now believe to be true: Any form other than &#34;normal&#34; results in a shorter lifespan than optimal.  <BR>Onomiba, your examples may have just proven this to be true! Your other thread, &#34;new: TOO MUCH SLEEP MAKE YOUR MONSTER SLEEPS FOREVER&#34; has also given evidence to support this, even though you were not looking for the answer.  <BR>I have another question: What form was your metal glory for the majority of your training? Did it always stay at normal? or did it go to skinny/slim/fat/plump alot?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I started a new game not too long ago. When I got Charles, I decided to raise him while using Troron as a baby. Here are the results:  <BR>Name: Charles Type: Wracky&#40;Wracky/Wracky&#41; 1st gen  <BR>LIF 692 POW 573 INT 999 SKI 522 SPD 909 DEF 887 TOTAL - 4580  <BR>Age: 7 yrs 6 mons. &#40;Gold Peach&#41; 98W 0L 64KO.  <BR>This was just by using Troron! Not Paradoxine! Easily the most impressive wracky I&#39;ve ever seen...  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 12, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Now that is one unbelievably powerful &#34;1st gen&#34; monster. That sure beats my 1st gen phoneix by quite a bit.  <BR>Imagine with paradoxines.... I would predict your stats to look like this&#40;ORDER: LIF-POW-INT-SKI-SPD-DEF&#41;: 600-900-999-900-800-800 TOTAL: 4999.  <BR>By the way, why did you start a new game?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 12, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Just to test my training skills and prove myself. I still have my old games on save.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 12, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Great, you got my hopes up for nothing&#40;just kidding&#41;. I saw this in the &#34;new answers&#34; section and thought maybe onomiba has answered my question.  <BR>Where is that guy? I need him to confirm the form status of his metal glory.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 22, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Too much battle! Too much hard Drill! Oh yeah. That SUPERB Metal Glory---&#62; it wasalways normal. I gave him apple cake sometimes &#40;before i took him to rest&#41; Hei! do you realize that meat is better than tablet in keeping your monster in  form?  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Your metal glory was normal the &#34;entire&#34; time? This is very strange. Then what could explain your metal glory&#39;s shorter lifespan? Maybe you combined with a monster that gave you a shorter overall lifespan?  <BR>That doesn&#39;t make sense though! I combined a pure &#40;durahan/durahan&#41; with a gidras&#40;durahan/metalner&#41; to get my metal glory. Both of the parents had short lifespans and the result - a long lifespan.  <BR>Well, it&#39;s obvious that form needs to be studied even more, if we want to find out what its true effects are...  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Welcome back, onomiba. I wondered what happened to you.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, January 26, 2000.  <BR> <BR>the parents: Father...um...main: durahan/metalner---&#62;fat Mother...sub : beacklon/dragon ---&#62; Plump Both of them beat the legends cup, the father lived for about 6 years&#41;, the beaclon lived for 5 years -almost six. result: the metal glory----&#62;fat and i remember that he was fat or plump at the end of 1st year. after that, i gave him apple cake before and after sleep. The result: it was always normal. Note: i didn&#39;t give him tablet, i give him milk, because after a battle, he always wanted meat, so, i gave him meat  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, January 28, 2000.
