So you&#39;re a beginner, and don&#39;t know how to get your monster to live longer! Don&#39;t sweat it! The game just takes some time to get used to. To increase your monsters lifespan, you should follow the twelve steps to the Eagle&#39;s Lifespan Increasing Method.  <BR>NOTE: This method is a culmination of every trainers secret to lifespan, including mine.  <BR>1.&#41; Feed it milk for the first 6 months of its life.  <BR>2.&#41; Feed your monster &#34;Nuts oil&#34; every time that it &#34;seems well.&#34;  <BR>3.&#41; Give your monster &#34;Mint Leaf&#34; the turn before it gets &#34;stressed out.&#34;  <BR>4.&#41; NEVER send your monster on errantries until it is about two years of age.  <BR>5.&#41; Don&#39;t fight your monster every time there is a tournament! Every tourney reduces the lifespan by two weeks.  <BR>6.&#41; Spend the first two years of your monsters life focusing on what it gets the highest stat increases on.  <BR>7.&#41; NEVER use drugs such as Nageel, Troron, Paradoxine, Kaseitan, Manseitan, Teromeann, Larox, etc.  <BR>8.&#41; NEVER let your monster be KO&#39;ed or injured in battle.  <BR>9.&#41; For an extra week of life, feed your monster a &#34;Magic Bananna.&#34;  <BR>NOTE: In order for the monster to gain this lifespan, loyalty must decrease by 10.  <BR>10.&#41; To extend lifespan, use peaches &#40;Silver and Golden&#41;.  <BR>11.&#41; NEVER send your monster on constant errantry. Once every three months &#40;after the age of two&#41; is sufficient.  <BR>12.&#41; Feed it what it likes, and keep an even raising style.  <BR>Use these tips, and I GUARANTEE you that your monster will live longer! Happy Ranching!  <BR>&#40;PS&#41;: Because everbody was creating training methods, I thought that I&#39;d illustrate the many of ways to increase lifespan. I hope that noone is bothered by this.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Dewell Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 22, 2000  <BR> <BR>Milk doesn&#39;t do anything except give you a cheap source of food for a monster&#39;s childhood. you could feed it anything except potatoes and it probably wouldn&#39;t matter unless it hated the food.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Jester X &#40;<A HREF="mailto:darkjester56@yahoo.com">darkjester56@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, February 23, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I have a Jell that lived up to 4 years and 8 months. I sent it to battle and errantry before it was even 5 months. it got Ko&#39;ed in battles like 25 times.Spent most of his time in errantry. I fed it drugs.STYLE:EVEN Loyal:95 Status: Slim Rank: S  <BR>Then I trained another Jell and live 4 yrs 2months. I did not send it to battle or errantry until it was one years old. It did not get ko&#39;ed in any battle but had some losses.Spent most of its time in the ranch training. No drugs.STYLE: SOFT LOYAL 90 STATUS: SLIM Rank: S  <BR>No gold peaches or silver peaches cause none of my monster ever lived longer than 4 years and 8 months.  <BR>So what you think?Would my First Jell lived longer if I treated it nicely when it was young?  <BR>Nothing against any of you just want your opinion.  <BR> <BR>-- &#40;<A HREF="mailto:KingUnion@aol.com">KingUnion@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 23, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Definitely. If you want your monster to live longer do NOT send them on errantries when they&#39;re babies. Wait until they&#39;re older. Also, lay off the goofballs, those knock off about 6 weeks of lifespan a pop, at least.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 24, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Hmmm..... I looked at your post closer. You did the right thing for extending lifespan by holding off on errantries and laying off the drugs. Why didn&#39;t your 2nd monster live longer? Did it get stressed out a lot? Get tired a lot? Those factors affect lifespan as well.  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Phoenix &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Arax7@aol.com">Arax7@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 24, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I dont know why it did not live as long as my first. I trained the second Jell by: 1st week rest,2nd &amp; 3rd week train then 4th week rest.&#40;no plant disc&#41;  <BR>I gave it mint leaf every three months or just bfore it was stressed out.  <BR>For the first Jell i worked it hard:more errantries,pretty tired,stress,more ko&#39;ed.&#40;no plant disc&#41;  <BR>Same thing happened to my phoenix.My first one lived 4 years 7 months. The other 4 years 2 months. AND THE SECOND ONE HAD A PLANT DISC! I used the same technique raising the first jell and phoenix. And I used the another technique raising my second jell and phoenix. So what you think?&#40;read how i raised them by reading the earlier posting.&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- &#40;<A HREF="mailto:KingUnion@aol.com">KingUnion@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 27, 2000.  <BR> <BR>By the way, if you send baby monsters to errantys, that is just a waste of money. They don&#39;t gain as much as they would in their prime and there is a VERY SLIM chance that babies will learn new moves.  <BR> <BR>-- cyberhillbilly &#40;<A HREF="mailto:cyberhillbilly@yahoo.com">cyberhillbilly@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, March 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>great list eagle! beginners would do well to follow it exactly. then, when you have a little confidence, try things a little different. for example, if my monsters like or are neutral to tablets, i switch from milk earlier than 6 mos. tablets are great for monsters. similarly, if my monster needs a key attack, i will go to that errantry at one year instead of 2. finally, if my monster is having a lot of stress problems, i will rest it or send it to a battle instead of nuts oil constantly. or play with it if it wants to. with a little experience, you pick up a feel for which rules to follow and which to bend a little.  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, March 13, 2000.
