<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>RNA</B> on <B>Tuesday, April 18, 2000 - 01:19 am</B>:</FONT><P>
First, before I list anything, I have to give full credit to this idea to my brother-in-law, Chase. I was playing NHL 2000 and he came up with the idea of grading monsters best moves by adding up their hit pct, force pct, withering, and sharpness.  <BR> <BR>He used this format: S=6, A=5, B=4, C=3, D=2, E=1, and -=0.  <BR> <BR>Although this method does not take Guts Cost into consideration, unless there is a tie on a monsters best move, then the lowest Guts Cost would be the best in his opinion. Here is a list of each type of monsters best move using his grading scale.  <BR> <BR>APE: Swing Throw, POW 50, S/D/B/D=14  <BR>ARROWHEAD: Somersaults, POW 50 A/B/C/A=17  <BR>BAJARL: Mystic Combo, POW 39 B/B/D/C=13  <BR>BAKU: Diving Press, POW 30 S/E/C/C=13  <BR>BEACLON: Frantic Horn, POW 50 B/A/B/C=16  <BR>CENTAUR: Z Smash, POW 55 B/A/B/A=18  <BR>COLOR PANDORA: Delta Attack, INT 55 B/S/B/C=17  <BR>DRAGON: Glide Charge, POW 27 C/A/E/A=14  <BR>DUCKEN: Frantic Beam, INT 45 C/B/C/A=15  <BR>DURAHAN: Punch Combo, POW 45 B/A/C/E=13  <BR>GABOO: Ninja Kick, POW 55 S/D/B/D=14  <BR>GALI: Hashing Mask, POW 38 C/C/C/A=14  <BR>GHOST: Combination POW 55 B/B/B/E=13  <BR>GOLEM: Fist Missile, POW 55 A/C/A/C=16  <BR>HARE: Kung Fu Kick, POW 44 A/D/D/A=14  <BR>HENGER: Laser Swords, POW 55 S/D/A/B=17  <BR>HOPPER: 3 Jump Blows, POW 35 B/D/D/S=14  <BR>JELL: Gatling Gun, INT 45 B/S/D/C=15  <BR>JILL: Snowstorm, INT 45 B/A/B/E=14  <BR>JOKER: Death Final, POW 50 S/E/S/C=16  <BR>KATO: Rolling Claw, POW 30 B/D/B/S=16  <BR>METALNER: Back Charge, POW 29 C/D/C/S=14  <BR>MEW: Maximal Zap, INT 50 S/E/A/B=16  <BR>MOCCHI: Mocchi Cannon, INT 50 A/D/C/B=14  <BR>MOCK: Twisters, INT 50 S/D/E/A=14  <BR>MONOL: 3 Knocks, POW 50 A/S/C/E=15  <BR>NAGA: Eye Beam, INT 29 B/D/C/B=13  <BR>NITON: Violent Shell, POW 50 A/D/B/B=15  <BR>PHOENIX: Fire Wave, INT 50 S/C/D/C=14  <BR>PIXIE: Big Bang, INT 46 A/E/C/B=13  <BR>PLANT: Seed Gatling, INT 27 C/C/D/A=13  <BR>SUEZO: Chewing, POW 45 B/B/C/E=12  <BR>TIGER: Blizzard, INT 32 C/B/D/S=15  <BR>UNDINE: Water Cannon, INT 50 B/A/A/C=17  <BR>WORM: Wheel Attack, POW 44 B/C/B/C=14  <BR>WRACKY: Cursed Dance, POW 55 B/C/B/S=17  <BR>ZILLA: Wave Riding, POW 45 S/D/A/C=16  <BR>ZUUM: Fire Bomb, INT 50 S/E/B/A=16  <BR> <BR>Overall, the best move appears to be the Z Smash by the CENTAUR. I&#39;m sure that most of you have your own opinions on what the best move is for each monster, but I thought this was an interesting way of trying to decide what was the best move for each monster.  <BR> <BR>-- Tony &#40;amcdaniel@riteaid.com&#41;, March 30, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>straining the techs down to raw numbers is an interesting thought, but in practice there is much more to it than that. As you mentioned yourself, there&#39;s the guts usage. There&#39;s also the factor of guts generation of the monster to think about.  <BR>In addition, it is more important how the diferent abilities combine together. Everyone knows how powerful an A to-hit and A force tech is, even if it has D or E withering and sharpness. That would only get 12-14 points on your scale, not even enough to rate! Also, a technique with high withering and high hit% is good, even if it has low force or sharpness. low hit% is okay if you have high force and sharpness. It&#39;s all about how they go together.  <BR> <BR>Good project though, it&#39;s an interesting approach/  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell &#40;apparatus@@juno.com&#41;, March 30, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I wonder if some factor or multiplier should be added for drain moves? Yes the Mock&#39;s Twisters attack is very powerful, but energy steal can actually have a greater impact on a battle. Under your formula it&#39;s A/E/A/- = 11, but you get 3/5 of the damage back as Lif and 3/5 of the withering back as guts! So should the rating for this attack be 17 to take into account its drain characteristics?  <BR>Good work BTW.  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;honcho7@excite.com&#41;, March 30, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Hey, as long as the moves work thats what counts. I definitely have some favorites. 1. The durahans death bringer. This move just kicks ass! 2. The durahans slash combo. The &#39;coupe de gras&#39; 3. The centaurs run smash. I always scream along with the monster with this move.  <BR> <BR>-- Mikey &#40;forrightsurethere@hotmail.com&#41;, March 30, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Good point Farmer Jimbo! If I had more time yesterday I would have tried to go a little more in depth study on each move, perhaps the monsters best INT based move along with his best power based move. Most monsters best moves using the math table Chase created were usually POW 45&#43;. That&#39;s a big hit on gut cost right there! I thought on a Durahan that the Deathbringer would be his best move, but the bad thing with it is low hit pct. and if you miss, you cause damage to yourself.  <BR> <BR>-- Tony &#40;amcdaniel@riteaid.com&#41;, March 30, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>i find the ratings useless, a move with S damage and E accuracy is not good, no matter what. a move with B/A, or B/S, is alot better than any S class move  <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;BUT, it does serve as a good list of all the best techs!!! good work  <BR> <BR>-- trey &#40;treymjb@aol.com&#41;, March 30, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>kind of messy  <BR> <BR>-- RaPtOr2157 &#40;raptor2157@aol.com&#41;, March 30, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Tony, that looks like an excellent beginning for what could become a major undertaking. As a general yardstick, it gives us beginners a tool to use. Seems like the weighting might need to be adjusted, and maybe &#40;as mentioned above&#41; some other factors added in. I like the idea!  <BR> <BR>-- locke &#40;idi@gate.net&#41;, March 30, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Oops, just noticed my email cookie is mispelled... I&#39;m correcting it now. Should be iti@gate.net Sorry!  <BR> <BR>-- locke &#40;iti@gate.net&#41;, March 30, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Well, I&#39;m on vacation, but I loaned my bro-in-law my MR2 so I could work on MR1. I do have a full tech list for each monster, and I&#39;ll try to come up with a bit more technical way of doing it besides just adding up the points like he suggested. Perhaps add the points together, deduct for high guts cost, add pts. if it steals life/guts from opponent. You&#39;re right Locke!!! This could be a MAJOR undertaking. Oh well, I&#39;m the one who opened this can of worms!!  <BR> <BR>-- Tony &#40;amcdaniel@riteaid.com&#41;, March 30, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>To calculate in the guts cost of each technique you could...take the guts cost and divide it by the total from your report card value...so you would be looking for a low guts cost to value ratio...so the Hashing Mask costing 38 guts with a value of 14 would have a 2.71 ratio...making it more efficient than the Ninja Kick...which would have a 3.93 &#40;55 divided by 14&#41; ratio...what do you think?  <BR> <BR>-- fred &#40;baab_thatcher@yahoo.com&#41;, March 30, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>good idea, fred. i would do it the other way, so that the number was higher - .368 &#91;14 divided by 38&#93; better than .255 &#91;14 divided by 55&#93; but as long as people know what you&#39;re talking about, it could work either way!  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;dst10000@compuserve.com&#41;, March 31, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>5 factors are required to make an accurate basis in which all techs can relate to:  <BR>1&#41; letter grades of tech parameters &#40;data available&#41;  <BR> <BR>2&#41; guts regeneration speed of monster with regard to &#40;breed/subbreed&#41; - &#40;data not available&#41;  <BR> <BR>3&#41; guts usage of tech&#40;data available&#41;  <BR> <BR>4&#41; equalizing all seven tech parameters&#40;force, recovery, guts recovery &#40;?&#41; hit%, probability, withering, sharpness&#41; - &#40;data not available&#41;  <BR> <BR>5&#41; location of letter grade within its own letter grade spectrum &#40;data not available&#41;  <BR> <BR>1 minor factor that could be ignored:  <BR> <BR>1&#41; tech&#39;s execution time &#40;data not available&#41;  <BR> <BR>Factor number &#40;4&#41; means that handicaps will need to be given to force and Hit% and others&#40;?&#41; because they are obviously more important than withering and sharpness. This can be seen from careful analysis of the tech lists.  <BR> <BR>For example, Durahan&#39;s Sword Throw-25&#40;C/D/D/A&#41; compared with Durahan&#39;s Triple Slash-40&#40;B/D/D/C&#41;. These are approximately reciprocal techs from the same monster yet the Triple Slash has one letter grade handicap and it still takes 15 more guts to execute!  <BR> <BR>Factor &#40;5&#41; was pointed out by Sean X. Chang a while ago. Basically, two techs with the same letter grade may have different locations in that letter grade&#39;s spectrum.  <BR> <BR>For example, try comparing two techs with the same letter grade assigned to its hit%. If these two techs are on the same monster during battle, then it will be very unlikely for their hit% to be the same.  <BR> <BR>I noticed this when battling with a monster that had the same hit% letter grade on two techs, but one tech had a higher hit%. Others have noticed big differences in force variation as well. For the original discovery and some examples, go to &#34;How to get ALL techniques/chains for your monster.&#34; from the &#34;techniques/tech chains&#34; category. Read Sean Chang&#39;s post on december 4th.  <BR> <BR>It would VERY helpful to analyze the usefulness of a tech compared to all other techs but it will be VERY difficult to do so. One suggestion to help reduce the labor, is to use guts regeneration data, which is not yet available, of only the purebreeds. Measuring each letter grade assignment for every parameter of every tech will take an infinitely long time so it is suggested that this should be dropped as well - basically, you sacrifice some accuracy in the data for merely the existence of the data. Equalizing all 7 parameters is possible but will take some work. Other things should be taken into consideration but this is all I can think up of as of now. This project is a toughie, so is anyone decides to take it up, get ready for one bumpy ride.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;RNA@Ribosome.nuc&#41;, March 31, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>&#34;Measuring each letter grade assignment for every parameter of every tech will take an infinitely long time so it is suggested that this should be dropped as well - basically, you sacrifice some accuracy in the data for merely the existence of the data&#34; -RNA  <BR>That is from my above post, last paragraph, in which may be a little unclear. You need to measure each letter grade&#39;s location in its corresponding leter grade&#39;s spectrum. This is regarding factor &#40;5&#41;.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;RNA@Ribosome.nuc&#41;, March 31, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Thanks to all for your input. I am working up something right now. RNA, your great intellect has almost made my head explode trying to keep up with it. Things that you, Torey, and Fred said are what I am trying to consider in re-doing it.  <BR> <BR>-- Tony &#40;amcdaniel@riteaid.com&#41;, April 01, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>remember, tony, to come up with a useful stat does not require that you include all variables in it. batting average in baseball is useful because of its ease of computation, and its uniformity. but everyone knows a .300 hitter in the astrodome is better than a .300 hitter at wrigley, or that a .300 hitter who can&#39;t draw walks or hit for any power is actually weaker than a .260 hitter with a .380 obp, or a .240 hitter with a .500 slugging pct. so i think the answer isn&#39;t so much in trying to include rna&#39;s concepts in a &#34;steven hawking unified thread theory&#34; stat, but instead, to develop other peripheral stats to go along with a &#34;guts efficiency/damage&#34; stat.  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;dst10000@compuserve.com&#41;, April 01, 2000.
