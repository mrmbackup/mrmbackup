 I&#39;m having a lot of problems with this Pixie/Wracky.  After getting all the techniques I could without it, I decided to pick up the crossover techniques with a gameshark &#40;the ones that would otherwise be impossible to get, like Death Final&#41;.  However, rather than giving her the list of second-row moves, it actually DELETES Bang and Big Bang from her list to make her second slot empty during battle!  However, it claims that she has everything when I look at her outside of battle.  I&#39;ve tried deleting lines of the code to make up for this, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work.  It gives me Fire Breath in the 3rd range no problem, which is also a crossover technique, but when I try to modify the code to JUST get Firebreath, it junks the Bang moves again!  What gives?  DP or any other gameshark experts, could you help me out?  I&#39;ve tried this on a few other monsters to experiment, and it doesn&#39;t do this with any other species &#40;although it will refuse to give me the bottom-left moves on many monsters&#39; lists&#41;.  Any help?  Anyone?

 It&#39;s not cheating if you can&#39;t get it any other way.  Like the Gentlemocchi.

 in my opinion, cheating is self-defined.  however, to those who wish to explore the matter more in-depth, there is a thread in existence to discuss what is or is not cheating.

 Torey:  Where is this thread?  I&#39;d love to read it for philosophical reasons.  I tried to find it with the keyword search and by browsing manually, and the only one I could find is The Cafe &#62; May 2001 Topics &#62; Best Method Not Involving Cheating?, which didn&#39;t seem to be quite what I was expecting.  Is there another one and, if so, where?  Thanks!

 ya - fade started another thread that same day that i responded to at length, where he basically said &#34;if you are gonna use endless resetting and bananas to max out a monster, why not just use a gameshark?  they both are ways of cheating&#34;.  &#91;i am oversimplifying fade&#39;s message, i know&#93;.  many people responded with what they considered to be cheating and what was not.  it appears, however, to have been deleted.

 And yes, I have used it to get a Gentlemocchi, whom I raised and loved very much.

 I heard somewhere the xiaNaix tech codes do not work properly and that they are off by 1.  Plus I believe there were some activations code required.  I don&#39;t remember much of what was said though.

 Having the same problems as Nate, I can&#39;t get any of the techniques that I&#39;ve gotten off the gameshark to activate during battle, and he&#39;s right, the pixies more difficult than any of them. If anyone can figure out how to hack the activation codes so they work...PLEASE HELP!!! <BR>I&#39;ve been using the codes 80097BD0 0600 <BR>                          80097BD2 120C <BR> <BR>           Thanx
