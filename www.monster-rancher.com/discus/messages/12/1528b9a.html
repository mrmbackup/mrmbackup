Okay, I&#39;ve gotten a hook on something that may revolutionize the game: I think I&#39;ve figured out how to control the &#34;lessons&#34; that your monster learns after battles, to a degree! Before choosing to go to a battle &#40;while still on the ranch&#41;, go to Drill and select three different light drills, backing out of each one, and then go back and choose to enter the battle. After the tournament&#39;s over, the stats associated with two of those three drills will be among your monster&#39;s gains! In other words, if you choose Power, Defense, and Speed, then two of those three &#40;never just one, never all three, from what I&#39;ve seen&#41; will be in your boosts! This means that while raising a Wracky, you could just keep choosing Power, Skill, and whatever else you feel like working on, and roughly force your monster to get decent stat gains in those areas through enough battles! As a disclaimer, it&#39;s really hard to get into the habit of doing, and I haven&#39;t tested it seriously with any other monster than the one I&#39;m currently working on, but it&#39;s still something to pay attention to!  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;ChimeraMan101@aol.com&#41;, February 12, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Oh yeah, and before anyone states that this just may be random chance....there&#39;s a 1/40 chance that the two of the three drills you chose would be in the post-battle score, and this happens to me every time I&#39;ve thought to try it, so I really do think that this is more than random chance.  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;ChimeraMan101@aol.com&#41;, February 12, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>i tried it and it doesn&#39;t work! <BR> <BR>-- clay &#40;kornkid_16blind@yahoo.com&#41;, February 12, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I figured out another way of controlling the &#34;lessons&#34; that your monster gains after battle. I simply reload and do the battle all over again if I don&#39;t get the stat&#40;s&#41; that I wanted. Works pretty much 50% of the time, from what I&#39;ve noticed.  <BR>Someone on fade&#39;s board thought that your gains after battle correspond to what you do during battle. &#40;ie, getting hit too many times = increase in DEF or SPD&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;RNA@Ribosome.nuc&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I used to think that too, RNA. Then, one battle, my monster got &#43;10 def &#40;C class tourney&#41; without taking a single damage during combat. In the next tournament, I repeated this process, but came up with nothing but a few points in lif. I dismissed the concept, and during one battle, my monster was taken into the yellow zone &#40;It just would not connect with the techs.&#41;. When my monster returned from battle, it had gotten &#43;8 def, and &#43;5ski. These findings bring me to the conclusion that it IS all based on chance random.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;Eagle1@Citynet.net&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Actually, it looks to me like Nate&#39;s right. When I tried it, four times out of five, I got two of the stats I wanted to go up, and I always had at least one of them go up. This still could just all be chance, but I don&#39;t think so. Just my two cents...  <BR> <BR>-- Mikey &#40;SifDraco@AOL.com&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>I just tried it with my Garuda, of course it was only once and I picked life-intelligence-speed in that order and I got life and intelligence. Of course it could all be luck, but maybe not...  <BR> <BR>-- Vheod &#40;Vheod@hotmail.com&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Oh I always thought that the stats you get have something to do with the stats of your opponents... so if your opponents have very high power then your power increase would be more etc etc.  <BR>Thank you everybody for your time.  <BR> <BR>^_^  <BR> <BR>-- Dragity &#40;jinxy_boy@hotmail.com&#41;, February 14, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Everybody seems to be able to get this method to work. I&#39;ll try it sometime to see how well it really works.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;RNA@Ribosome.nuc&#41;, February 15, 2000.
