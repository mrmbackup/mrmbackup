 I combined my first two monsters, an Abisu/Plant and a Pixie/Lesione with the cat doll and got an uber-monster! It&#39;s a Mew/Hare??? Both of my original monsters had one stat over 300, one just over 100 and a couple at the 200 point. I don&#39;t recall stats exactly. The baby has: 282,252,592,317,325,224. I am really pleased!

 What in the name of God? <BR> <BR>Wow. <BR> <BR>I jcombined two freshly shrined monsters and got a baseline  <BR>Mew/Hare. I had no idea you could end up with anything like  <BR>that. Looks like there&#39;s a lot more to this combination system  <BR>than we thought, particularly in the case of secret seasonings. <BR> <BR>Shouldn&#39;t this go in the combination thread? It&#39;s no problem,  <BR>though, since you were so excited about posting this amazing  <BR>find. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve yet to get the item which regenerates Phoenix. I&#39;ll see if I get  <BR>similar results.

 BTW, you battled my Abisu/Plant, and and I did not raise it any more afterwards, so you know it wasn&#39;t the greatest monster by any means. However, it did make its way up to C rank -as did the Pixie.

Hmm... maybe rank has something to do with it? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try to raise sets of two Suezo at different ranks with identical stats for combination sometime this month. <BR> <BR>How similar were the monsters&#39; stats? Was the Undine also C Rank? It seems like there&#39;s a lot of stat carryover.  <BR> <BR>Also, did it get any extra techs? How many techs did the parents have?

 No extra techs, each parent only had one. The Undine was not at C rank, just D. And, that 592 is HIGHER than either parent ever had in any stat at all. The Undine had 350 Int, but the rest of the stats were lower, I recall having 2 stats just over 200. <BR> <BR>The Abisu/Plant was at 250 in Power, but everything else was just over 150 -except Int which I kept low because it had a power attack.

In that case, rank may not necessarily have an effect on this. Do you recall how old they were? How were their gains? <BR> <BR>It looks like the monsters&#39; life stages may have been a big factor in this, quite possibly in a manner similar to that of MR1, but with far more significant results. It may even explain some of the less-encouraging reported results involving combining monsters a week away from popping it. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s the only theory I can think of that holds water at present, barring the potential of the Cat Doll itself. <BR> <BR>Regardless, given the huge boost in the stats, especially the ridiculous 529, it seems that both parents&#39; stats contributed somehow. There must be a pattern in the results when compared to both parents&#39; statistics. <BR> <BR>This is all very valuable data. It&#39;s going to make experimenting significantly easier, since I&#39;ll just have to worry about age.

 They were both just at the end of prime. They were getting good gains, but I was worried about death coming in a few months. The Pixie was 2y1m, and the Abisu was a few months older.

 Hasn&#39;t your The Tree grown any? Mine grew about two and a half  <BR>years in. <BR> <BR>Then again, I let my monster live out its entire life on the ranch.  <BR>Perhaps risking a monster dying influences the growth of your The  <BR>Tree.

 Try raising a moneymaker monster or some other monster that you  <BR>wouldn&#39;t mind dying, taking it as far as it can go. That might help  <BR>your The Tree grow. <BR> <BR>Come to think of it, I believe my Hornie actually lived three years by  <BR>the time it grew &#40;The Tree, not Hornie&#41;. See if that works. For a sure  <BR>fire 3 year life, try resting a monster to death. <BR> <BR>Sadly, I can&#39;t test it again due to the fact that my The Tree is  <BR>already nice and big.
