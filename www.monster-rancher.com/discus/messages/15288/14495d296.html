 So, after my first 2 monsters, I find that I am having trouble getting/keeping my Loyalty up.  Since I haven&#39;t thus far had real success figuring out a lot of the items, I haven&#39;t been able to use any of them effectively to help this problem.  So, I thought I would start by posting my observations about what has really caused a portion of my problem. <BR> <BR>1&#41;  Freezing your monster appears to cause a loss of 20 loyalty. <BR> <BR>  This was probably my biggest issue with my first monster.  I froze her frequently so that I could go have fun at the Shrine.  I couldn&#39;t keep her loyalty up at all. because I didn;t realize that I was losing loyalty for freezing. <BR> <BR>2&#41;  Resetting your DS when you are not at the main screen will cause a loss of 10 loyalty. <BR> <BR>  I discovered this with my second monster who was losing loyalty, but I couldn&#39;t figure out when.  I got into a 8 monster ladder tourney and lost in the second fight.  I was doing to tourney to fill out my &#34;won&#34; tournament list, so nothing less than a win was acceptable.  When I turned my ds back on, I got the message from my assistant &#40;which looked to me like it was just a suggestion that I should Save and not reset&#41;.  I looked at my monster&#39;s loyalty before entering the tourney again &#40;because I was having trouble with him obeying orders&#41; and discovered it had dropped from 45 to 35. <BR> <BR>  If folks can confirm my findings here, I will treat them as canon and adjust my play style accordingly.  I would also like to hear suggestions about raising loyalty.  My second monster is almost dead and I can&#39;t seem to get higher than about 45-50 loyalty.  &#40;of course, this monster has suffered some loyalty losses due to the above factors, so that has played a part in it.  It&#39;s a Durahan/Joker, so he like discipline, which make gaining loyalty easier, I feel.&#41;

 You know, that actually explains a lot. Whilst going abouts my  <BR>tests, I reset frequently, and found that my first two monsters  <BR>fooled around in battle their entire lives. It seems that I  <BR>misinterpreted one of the status screen items as loyalty, but I can&#39;t  <BR>say with absolute certainty at this point. I&#39;ll give it a look-see later. <BR> <BR>Based on my experiences, though, I&#39;d say you&#39;re right on the  <BR>money.

 The monster status screen has 2 numbers in the lower right corner of screen 1.  The top one is Loyalty &#40;The Kanji is for Trust, IIRC&#41;.  The one below is for Fame. <BR> <BR>That first screen lays out something like this: <BR> <BR>Name: oooooooo <BR>Monster: &#40;breedname&#41; ICON X ICON <BR>Age: &#40;X years Y Months&#41;  Rank: &#40;E-S&#41; <BR>Body Shape?: &#40;something&#41; Temperment?: &#40;something&#41; <BR>Likes: &#40;likes..&#41; Loyalty: &#40;00&#41; <BR>Dislikes: &#40;hates..&#41; Fame: &#40;100&#41; <BR> <BR>  I am still trying to figure out  the shape/temperment stuff..

 &#34;Body shape&#34; has been called form/figure in previous games. Basically, it&#39;s whether your monster&#39;s thin, normal, or fat. <BR> <BR>Kanjusei &#40;the one you called &#34;temperament&#34;&#41; translates to &#34;sensitivity&#34; according to my dictionary. It&#39;s discussed a little in the Tips thread. <BR> <BR>To stay on topic, I&#39;ve noticed that my monsters&#39; loyalty increases by about 3 when I give it the item it says it likes on the status screen &#40;it also decreases when I give it the item it dislikes&#41;. Because you can give your monster an infinite amount of items each week, I found this helpful to raise loyalty quickly when I&#39;d been resetting too much. I don&#39;t think this affects your raising policy from what I&#39;ve observed, but I could be wrong.
