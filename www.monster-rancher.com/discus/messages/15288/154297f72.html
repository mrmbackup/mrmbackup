 Seems like all the shrine types in this game are  <BR>too random for us to reliably share anything about  <BR>the shrine. Try drawing the same picture or writing  <BR>the same word a few times? do you get the same  <BR>monster? i thought maybe where you hit the grid  <BR>would be what made it work but if i put a spot in  <BR>the top left square it still keep getting different  <BR>monsters every time.

 The Drawing and Speech methods are indeed laced with randomness.  The text input has less so because it has built in handwriting recognition.  If you put the word Tiger in the text section, it should come out the same every time.

 Maybe i just have really bad handwriting then.  <BR>chase thats not working either. Does it recognize  <BR>only Capitals or lowercases too?

 That i don&#39;t know. I will do some testing now that i have it available.  I just unlocked dragon and Joker and now I can take a break and regen some monsters.

 After a little testing, it does distinguish between caps and lower case. <BR> <BR>  I was able to get the same monster 3 times in a row by using the same word.  &#40; &#34;Tiger&#34; resulted in Dracomocchi all 3 times.  a 4th time, i was a much messier in my writing and got a golem instead&#41;

 Second test - tried &#34;THORR&#34; 5 times and got a Joker every time. <BR> <BR>  Then I tried &#34;Thorr&#34; 5 times and got a Joker each time. <BR> <BR>Maybe it doesn&#39;t distinguish, but you have to be consistent your clarity.. <BR> <BR>  Testing a third word. <BR> <BR>Tried &#34;ODIN&#34; 5 times, got the same Mocchi/Ducken each time. <BR> <BR>Tried &#34;Odin&#34; 5 times and got a different monster each time.   <BR> <BR>  Perhaps it simply is more picky on the lower case.  I am finding with more words that Upper case are giving me consistent results but lower case are not.

 I suspect that alot of the seeming &#34;randomness&#34; from the written character creation with lowercase letters stems from the game not properly recognizing letters that are in more than one part, such as an &#34;i&#34; or &#34;j&#34; I noticed that you had 2 examples of lowercase working fine and then in the latest where it did not work that word &#34;Tiger&#34; has an i in it so this follows what I have seen so far.  <BR> <BR>I have also noticed some weirdness with letters that have close analogs, such as &#34;q&#34; and &#34;g&#34;. <BR> <BR>Just thought i would mention this and see if it matches up with other peoples experience.

 When entering the word &#34;CHUCK&#34;, making sure to use  <BR>all capitals, but attempting to write them  <BR>differently each time &#40;angling letters  <BR>differently, writing more to the left side of the  <BR>boxes one time, then to the right side, etc.&#41; I  <BR>received a Mewnda 8/10 times. <BR> <BR>However, when I wrote it as &#34;Chuck&#34;, I found that  <BR>I got a different result each time. Considering  <BR>the only things that might might have been misread  <BR>would be the letter u being read as the letter v,  <BR>I would think that I should have only gotten two  <BR>or three different monsters.  <BR> <BR>For whatever reason, it seems that like Thorr  <BR>posted, the game only reliably recognizes capital  <BR>letters, and even then there&#39;s still a certain  <BR>amount of randomness or recognition issues added  <BR>in.

 well there is also the h which could be read as a b the c which could be an o ect. But yes i didnt mean to allude that Thorr was wrong, hes totally right that it seems to be more random with lower case characters, I was just trying to explain some of the randomness.

 Im having trouble testing this thing out further since every other monster I produce is locked and unlike others in the series you get no hint as to what it is. So i guess I am just going to have to do some unlocking before i can get into it more, I should be able to get beaklon and dragon soon. And maby zan if the 2 trip viewing of the crystals works.

 Ok ive unlocked beaklon dragon zan and durahan and have been able to test alot more stuff. I definatley have gotten more varied results with lowercase letters but have also seen several pure capital words that randomly produce something else aswell. So far I have achieved the most consistant results by choosing the letters that are the easiest and clearest to write for me. For example I was playing around using my friend erics name. by writing the word &#34;eric&#34; 5 times i got 3 different monsters, while writing it as &#34;ERIC&#34; 5 times I still got 2 different monsters. However after noticing how Diferent my E&#39;s kept turning out I tried &#34;eRIC&#34; and got the same durahan 5 times in a row.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Random side note, while trying to come up with words to use i started using the names of groto boss monsters from dragon quest 9. Out of the 13 I tested &#40;all of them that were &#60;= 7 characters&#41; 12 of them spawned monsters that require unlocking. Including beaklons dragons durahans and zans, as well as 3 that I havent unlocked yet.  Maby coincidence, but i find it rather interesting.

 The actual letters you use are far less important than the number of letters you use.  The more letters, the higher the breed tier.

 oh... well thats rather depressing. when the spell section was introed and it said each letter would &#34;add or subtract&#34; from the monster I was kinda hoping you would be able to find small words that unlocked the main breed you wanted and then add letters to it to determine the subreed or something. &#40;ofcourse I originally thought it would add or subtract stats but I now know they are all same stats for same breed&#41;. <BR> <BR>Im a little disappointed in the spawning features of this one, each type seemed like it would be so cool, but the more i learn about them it seems more like they put a cheap toy in a fancy box. The spell section was my last hope.

 It&#39;s because of the localization.  We had this discussion in the MFDS2.  I think we all agreed that it may be difficult to port this game to english.  The Japanese game would recognize words in the speech section.  It would also recognize words in the Text section.  Those two features are very region-specific and would need lots of love to make them work in English.  We may not have received a game with all the love it deserved, but I am still happy to be playing it in english and not in Japanese.

 This is true, I am very glad we got it. And it is alot of fun. Definatly one of the better installations. If it worked better in japanese then thats a consolation at least, it shows the game got effort in its creation which says to me that someone cares about it at least!  <BR> <BR>Also just completed rank S! boy that was quite a surprise! stupid tounge biting dood lol. Its anoying that they took the herbs away though since My monster is on its last legs I am going to have to raise another to beat them and will have to fork out for mushrooms. Ah well at least it adds a twist to it.

 There is someone on GameFAQs by the name of Swift Wolf that has hacked some of the game data and has posted both an illustration of what monster can be obtained from the Magic Field and what numerical levels of stress and fatigue Cleo&#39;s warning messages correspond to. I can provide links to this data if you like.
