I have managed to acquire a complete collection of images for all the monsters in the game.  The images are not the best quality, but they are complete.  It turns out that the Modoki monsters are in the game, they are just not listed first like they were in MFDS.  They are listed last.  It looks like most of the special monsters are the same as MFDS, but obviously they are acquired differently since I haven&#39;t got a single one yet. <BR> <BR>Here is the link to my MFDS2 image directory - <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.thorrsoldhammers.com/MFDS2" TARGET="_blank">http://www.thorrsoldhammers.com/MFDS2</A> <BR> <BR>The images are numbered to correspond to the monster number in the book.

 That is an excellent monster selection. The re-classifications of some formerly-special breeds and brand new subs are great, not to mention the insane new and returning secret monsters. Eggplantern and Blue Phoenix are back! <BR> <BR>That said, I am quite disappointed that they didn&#39;t add a single new Suezo. What&#39;s the harm in throwing in a White Suezo or an Orion or something? They had enough time to introduce so many great new features and monsters, after all. Regardless, overall I am very happy with the selection. <BR> <BR>By the way, where did you get these?

 I&#39;ll be honest.  I made them.  I found a GameShark code that unlocks every monster in your book.  So I hooked the DS up to the PC, copied my original save ram to it, started a new game and used the code.  I took every snapshot.  &#40;Sorry for the low quality, but homebrew isn&#39;t always perfect&#41;. <BR> <BR>  I just put my original save back on my cartridge this morning.  &#40;I don&#39;t want to cheat my way thru the game because it&#39;s no fun&#41;. <BR> <BR>  Side note - there is a story event when you complete your book.  The character at the beginning who challenges you in E class comes by and your assistant brags to him that you finished the book.  He is mad and jealous and dejected.  In the end of it, I got a Golden Peach as a reward.  &#40;What was funny is that I had just talked to the guy because the game had just started.&#41; <BR> <BR>  Soooooo....  I guess we can complete the monster list now, eh?

 Upon closer inspection, it seems that you skipped from 146 to 148. Where&#39;s 147?

 I just realized that Gamba wasn&#39;t in the last game. Looks like they gave Suezo some love after all. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve added as many monsters as I could for the time being. I&#39;d like to ask Thorr and Lisa to gloss over the newer monster entries to ensure I got the translations right, and suggestions for improved romanization. I left out the ones I couldn&#39;t read/romanize. Thanks a lot!

 I&#39;ll take care of the missing monster..  I may have just fudged it up when I was renaming.  Looking at the direftory, it looks like I simply forgot to upload it.  It&#39;s there now.  It&#39;s the Mocchi/Ducken

 Would it be an issue if we rearranged the breed list to be in the order of the book?  I know that it&#39;s currently in alphabetical order and that our other endeavors have been that way, but I can&#39;t say as I have ever liked that...

 The original reason was that, say, in MRA, you wanted to make a Pixie army and raise one of every type it was easier to find the Pixie section alphabetically. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, it&#39;s not that hard to change and change back, so go for it.

 I personally think the alphabetical sorting should stay. The numerical order of monsters in the MR games over the years has been pretty haphazard, differing completely with nearly every new entry, whereas the alphabetical sorting allows for 100% consistency across all titles.  <BR> <BR>Until the series sees a more uniform numerical sorting, I think we should stick with what we have.

 It&#39;s not a big deal either way to me.  I was just having issues trying to find which monsters aren&#39;t currently in the monster list.  By having them in numerical order, it&#39;s loads easier.  The Perfect Guide for MFDS has the breeds alphabetically sorted by first kana.

 I understand. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll go over all the monsters a little bit later and list the ones I missed. To start, I excluded two Jokers, the special Durahan and some Centaurs, particularly the Centaur/Baku, which is the only monster whose name is written in hiragana for some reason.

 Scratch that, those are the only ones we&#39;re missing.  <BR> <BR>That said, I&#39;m not 100% confident in some of my  romanizations/translations for the new monsters. Let&#39;s go over them one more time.

 Usually if it is written in hiragana then there is a translation.  I believe the centaur/baku name translates to Companion.

 252 means Chief or the like in Japanese, I believe. <BR>254 I believe is Black Pierce. To me, that&#39;s definitely a &#39;pi&#39; and not a &#39;bi&#39;, which would make Pierce the word.  <BR> <BR>Just my two cents.
