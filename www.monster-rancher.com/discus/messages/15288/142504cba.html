 Alrighty, here&#39;s a place where we can list the upgrades for the  <BR>ranch, what they do, how much they cost and how frequently the  <BR>people come over. <BR> <BR>Thus far, I managed to get the first barn upgrade, which lets you  <BR>house bigger monsters like Golem and Baku. The asking price  <BR>was 4000G, but because I was a bit low on funds at the time, the  <BR>carpenter gave me a rather large discount, the new price being  <BR>1500G. <BR> <BR>The house upgrades apparently add space to your inventory. <BR> <BR>The Tree upgrades reportedly help your monsters live  <BR>significantly longer. The first one is said to cost 2000G. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure one of the upgrades gives you access to the hard drills,  <BR>but I&#39;m not sure which one it is. Probably a different upgrade  <BR>altogether? I&#39;ve had nothing but light drills for a bit over two  <BR>years now, with my monster at Rank B.

Ah, the first home upgrade gives you two hard drills, power-related &#40;Pow &amp; Lif Up&#41; and meditation &#40;Int &amp; Ski Up&#41;. It also gave me an inventory boost. The cost is the same as the first barn upgrade, 4000G. Sadly, I had just about enough to pay him.

 The second one gives you the next two drills, an Evasion&#40;big&#41;/Intelligence&#40;small&#41;/Power&#40;down&#41;, and a Defense&#40;big&#41;/Life&#40;small&#41;/Intelligence&#40;down&#41;.

 The next upgrades costs are 8000g and 12000g.

 What does the third house upgrade give, aside from another  <BR>inventory boost? <BR> <BR>Has anyone gotten a The Tree upgrade yet?

 I got two more training options. <BR> <BR>One reduce powewr, increases int, and greatly increases speed. The  <BR>other decreases int, increases life, and greatly increases defense.

 Those are the same upgrades MrMister mentioned the other day  <BR>from the second house upgrade. Did you get them from a different  <BR>upgrade?  <BR> <BR>That&#39;d be pretty versatile.

 Ah, so it&#39;s the second house upgrade. At least it&#39;s consistent. <BR> <BR>It&#39;d be convenient of an entire new set of hard drills were available  <BR>after the third house upgrade. But as it stands, the light drills and  <BR>hard drills are identical to those in MR2, which worked perfectly on  <BR>their own.

 Just got the 30000G ranch upgrade. Other than being broke and  <BR>having a 4th item page, nothing new seems to have happened &#40;No  <BR>new training options&#41;. I was hoping for a beaklon event because my  <BR>favorite monster from MR1 was worm and thats all thats left of him  <BR>:&#40; Perhaps when october rolls around again something will happen.  <BR>Also at the time he didn&#39;t offer another ranch upgrade after the  <BR>12000&#40;which i purchased at the prior meeting&#41;. The game won&#39;t le  <BR>me make more monsters for the ranch so the demo of seeing  <BR>multiple monsters battling may just be team rancher battles.

 Next time you should consider bargaining with the carpenter. When  <BR>he tells you the price and asks you if it&#39;s okay, say no, then he&#39;ll  <BR>offer you a discount. I managed to get the second barn upgrade for  <BR>4000G instead of 8000 this way. <BR> <BR>Since none of the game&#39;s tournaments are 3 vs. 3, it makes sense  <BR>that team battles are PvP only.

 By next time, I actually meant your next playthrough in the eventual English release. <BR> <BR>I wonder if you have the option of getting another special upgrade sometime after you beat the game? Remember the excessively extravagant final upgrade in MRA2? <BR> <BR>Yes, I believe we all do. <BR> <BR>Regardless, as it stands, based on the information you&#39;ve provided, there appears to be four house upgrades and three barn upgrades, with the following prices: <BR> <BR>1st &#40;both&#41;: 4000G &#40;Discount: 1500G&#41; <BR> <BR>2nd &#40;both&#41;: 8000G &#40;Discount: 4000G&#41; <BR> <BR>3rd &#40;both&#41;: 12000G &#40;Discount: ?G&#41; <BR> <BR>4th &#40;house&#41;: 30000G &#40;Discount: ?G&#41;
