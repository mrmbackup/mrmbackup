 First of all, hello hello, long time lurker first time poster, all that good stuff. <BR> <BR>1. I went into the Volcano errantry to unlock Pheonix, but I had to leave shortly after getting the Gold Peach, before I could find the injured Pheonix. When I went back later, I was unable to find the Pheonix again, or any event crystals that related to it. Am I locked out of getting Pheonix permanently now, or do I have to wait until the peach grows back? <BR> <BR>2. Does a reset take a toll on monsters in the freezer as well as your active one, or just your active one? <BR> <BR>Thanks for taking the time to read and answer!

 1&#41;  If you still have a peach, you should be able to finish the segment. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Unknown.  If it doesn&#39;t affect Frozen monsters, then there is a sure fire way to save and reload for tournaments...

 I have been monitoring some of the cheat code websites to see if anyone actually has found the Action Point stat.  So far I have seen nothing.  Personally, I don&#39;t want to ruin my game experience by cheating, but it would be nice to get some more concrete answers.

 I have access to the tools i would need to dump and  <BR>explore my game save. Dunno how much we&#39;d be  <BR>able to get out of watching memory dumps in a hex  <BR>editor without putting a lot of time into it  <BR>though. Anyone have an idea if what i would be  <BR>looking for? <BR> <BR>When i get around my other PC i&#39;ll try doing some  <BR>hex compares on some saves.

 I do still have the peach, but can&#39;t find any event crystals relating to Pheonix when I went back, so I don&#39;t know why they aren&#39;t showing up since I haven&#39;t used the peach.

 This happened to me as well. Seems to be a glitch.. However, no  <BR>need to worry. A while later, Cleo told me it was about time that  <BR>the peach grew back. I went on the Errantry again and picked the  <BR>peach, continued to the southeastern corner and the event crystal  <BR>appeared.

 I did an &#34;unofficial&#34; test of sorts, I guess you could say. lol <BR> <BR>I froze my monster, saved and loaded it back up... and went through 4 different combos using the combine items I had. <BR> <BR>1st monster = Durahan with a detailed galaxy symbol <BR>2nd monster = Joker with a galaxy symbol <BR>3rd monster = Naga with a galaxy symbol <BR>4th monster = Phoenix with a sun symbol <BR> <BR>...may just be coincidence, but perhaps not. I kept the phoenix and stopped trying once I saw the potential drop to a sun. <BR> <BR>It should be noted that both monsters had 900&#43; in 4 stats... both were galaxy potential monsters, both were SS rank and between 3years and 3years 5months old. <BR> <BR>Monster 1: Ultimate &#40;Gali/???&#41; <BR>Monster 2: Chaos Dragon &#40;Dragon/Abyss&#41; <BR> <BR>The Chaos Dragon was an overdrive monster, though I don&#39;t know if that means much. Also, it kept showing the potential arrow pointing vertically on every try. Maybe I just had some bad combining luck?

 Did you do anything that would make a monster good breeding fodder XxRisonxX? Because combining monsters that haven&#39;t been raised will result in a lower potential monster, and that may have skewed your results.

 Oh, well, this is what happens when I post when it&#39;s late at night, sorry. I thought he was saying the potential of his freezer monsters were dropping from galaxy to sun or something. Assumed the Ultimate and Chaos Dragon were combines from another test, since Pheonix can&#39;t be made from either of them.
