I just started my game, and my first monster failed its first week of training. &#40;Pound, to be precise.&#41; After asking if I wanted to scold or not, I was told that he had learned a new tech! <BR> <BR>So, unless this happens to everyone at the end of week one, I&#39;d say that at least some techs can just be learned randomly.

 Didn&#39;t happen to me on week one, so that&#39;s pretty cool. My monster is 2 years old and I haven&#39;t learned any techs on regular training, just on &#34;drills&#34;

 I think it may be random, my Mew failed training and  <BR>I scolded it, she then said that it was motivated  <BR>and learned a new move, I guess to make up for it. I  <BR>was like Yeaaah! So glad to be playing Monster  <BR>Rancher again,just got this one and Monster  <BR>Rancher 1!

 My monster just learned a new technique after losing a tournament and getting lectured for it. It definitely seems to have some to do with failing/getting scolded, oddly enough.

 There is a chance for monster to learn techs when the Discipline is in a certain range and their Wits are in a certain range.  However, every technique can be learned from a specific Drill. <BR> <BR> Some breeds &#40;like Tiger&#41; have it easy and can learn many techniques from a single location. &#40;Tiger has 5 techniques that can be learned from Trigonon&#41;.  Others &#40;like Mocchi&#41; have to visit every drill location to get all of their techs.  &#40;Mocchi has 12 techniques and gets 2 of them from each of the 6 Drill locations.&#41; <BR> <BR>  Techniques are learned differently by each main breed.  I will post a sample format for the tech chart soon.  I have complete tech charts in japanese, but it doesnt help with the English names.  If folks can post charts the way I show, I can fill in the charts with the exact Drill locations for each of the techniques.

 So you want us to post charts like the Pixie one you showed &#40;once we have a monster that knows all it&#39;s moves I assume&#41; so that you know the english names for sure right? Then you can input where to get the techs?

 Correct.  If you leave the space open for the Expedition location, I can go back and fill them in. <BR> <BR>  This is one of those tasks that is more suitable for folks who have a favorite monster and will want to get all of their techs.  The maximum number of techs a monster has can be 12, but most monsters have 10.  I will start up a creed info section where we can outline all the pertinent information on each main breed.  Once information is posted, I can merge it up to the main post.  I&#39;ll make a starter post shortly.

I have a good sample up - Tiger.

 Alright I&#39;ll try to finish up learning Beaclon&#39;s moves before posting it. I only have 2 more to learn. On that note Beaclon is spelled with a C not a K in this game, there&#39;s several typos in the info posts with this.

 On second thought, my Beaclon retired before I could learn the last tech. So I just posted what I had so far, I&#39;ll be training another one trying to get the last tech though :&#41; <BR> <BR> I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way for me to edit my own post, so I&#39;ll just say it here when I learn it and you can enter the details Thorr.

 No problem.  I really just need the name since I have all the other data.  That last tech is found in the Volcano... <BR> <BR> Also, Beaklon requires Barn size 3 &#40;aka 2 upgrades&#41;.

 I had an odd one occur...my Jailkeeper had  <BR>completed yet another defense drill without  <BR>gaining a tech. However, he&#39;d managed to defeat a  <BR>wanted monster. <BR> <BR>The next week, I got the message that he&#39;d gained  <BR>a technique from his most recent failure. The  <BR>thing is, he didn&#39;t really truly fail at anything,  <BR>unless it counts NOT learning a tech as a failure. <BR> <BR>Considering you can&#39;t scold or congratulate them  <BR>for simply returning from a drill, I&#39;m not sure  <BR>what&#39;s going on here.

 Yeah, that&#39;s happened to me too. Each of the monsters I&#39;ve trained has learned a skill from &#34;inspiration,&#34; some of which had never truly failed at anything at the time. I think it really is just random and they just put it in there assuming that you would have failed at least once before it occurred. I believe that they put this feature in to make up for the fact that if you turn the game off, your monsters become practically useless for breeding, as a lot of people, myself included, have shown disapproval towards that decision.

 And honestly, I like that. By all means, I&#39;m a fan  <BR>of letting players play a game &#34;their way&#34;. Once you   <BR>incorporate the online element in particular,  <BR>though, you have to have some sort of way of  <BR>preventing overtly cheap players from having total  <BR>dominance over every other person in the game.

 Pixie gets Ray Cast and Starlight from the Gupuka beach.  Starshower is from Erips ice ridge. one of the midrange moves is learned in the woods.  Dendron and Trigonon have the physical moves. <BR> <BR>I got a message about learning from a failure.  this one seemed to come from ending a drill by landing on a red-x tile.....  I&#39;ve also noticed that if the event is triggered the move the monster tries to learn might be something it already knows. :/ My dragon did that.  It lost in a tournament and created a new move that it already knew. <BR> <BR>@Thorr: I do that anyways.
