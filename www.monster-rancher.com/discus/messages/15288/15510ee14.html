 I managed to pick up the game at launch here in the States, but I&#39;m only just getting around to really playing it this weekend. I have a few questions for the gurus here before I begin. <BR> <BR>1&#41; Is MRDS set up like the MR games for the GBA, where you wanted to carefully breed powerful mixed-type monsters to permanently store in the Encyclopedia instead of just randomly creating them? If this is the case, what is the best way to create pure-breed monsters that cannot be obtained via the Magic Field? <BR> <BR>2&#41; Based on some of the posts that I have seen here, it looks like you can feed a monster more then one item per week. Are there any diminishing returns on using items past a certain point? Or can you feed a monster as many items as you want to your heart&#39;s content as long as you have the cash? <BR> <BR>3&#41; I understand that there are only four lifespan types for monsters in this game. Can you actually see what lifespan type your monster has in-game, or is this data that has to be determined through trial and error? Does the Perfect Guide have anything to say about this matter? <BR> <BR>4&#41; Are you notified by your assistant when a monster is entering a new stage of lifespan, or do you have to carefully observe the monster to determine what stage of life it is in as per MR2? <BR> <BR>5&#41; Can the best monsters be obtained through breeding in single-player mode, or are wi-fi battles pretty much required to obtain the best monsters? How do wi-fi battles affect their lifespan and stat growth? <BR> <BR>That&#39;s all I can think of for now. Many thanks in advance for your assistance! :&#41;

 I cant answer all of your questions, but i can answer most of them. <BR> <BR>2&#41;You can feed them once a month like all games, and sometimes they ask for more, but I assume you&#39;re talking about stress/fatigue relief items. You can feed them as much as you want, but i&#39;m not sure about increased effects for most things. Dragon Scales, which increase battle stats and lower Lifespan can be used more than once a week, but your basically killing your monster, because you only need one. <BR> <BR>3&#41;You can see their lifespan type when mixing. It will show all the stats it will have, including lifespan. It will have a symbol, there&#39;s an X, a Circle, a Circle inside a Circle, a Triangle, and a Star. I&#39;m not sure which one is better, but I assume the Star is best &#40;don&#39;t quote me on that&#41;. <BR> <BR>4&#41;Yes, Cleo will tell you when their in their prime, mature, and when to mix/retire them. <BR> <BR>5&#41;As far as I know, wifi battles don&#39;t affect their stats, but then again i&#39;ve only done a few matches.

 1&#41; Monsters in this game are like Monster Rancher 4 in a sense, being as each book monster has a set stat/move list/potential. <BR> <BR>Also, anytime you spawn a monster on this game outside of combining, it will have the base stats of the book monster.
