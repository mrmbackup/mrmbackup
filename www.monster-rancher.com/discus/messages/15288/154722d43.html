 You can get Beaclon in your first year.  Win the first Official Cup you find and you should still be in Summer.  Go to the Beach errantry and you can get beaclon. <BR> <BR>  Nearly all other unlockables require breeder rank B.

 I was able to unlock the Xenon using a B lvl Dragon &#40;Crevasse&#41;...he had high lvls as this was a combined monster.

About Beaclon, I sent my Hornie over to the beach recently and the Beaclon challenged him to arm wrestling. He lost, and Cleo demanded we both do a lot of log-pounding. He was 400 in Int, Spd and Ski, but 120-ish in Pow.  <BR> <BR>I tried looking for it four more times with my new Gadgeter G and I&#39;m not seeing it. You think I need to send my old Hornie over there again? <BR> <BR>By the way, how high was your monster&#39;s Pow when it became the Beaclon arm wrestling champion of the world?

 Mine was about 300-350 on my Tiger/Hengar.  It was only class D. <BR> <BR>  About your Gadgeter G, were you going in the Summer like you were supposed to?  Beaclon is one of the two unlockables that have a specific season. &#40;Beaclon is Summer at the beach; Joker is Spring on the Road&#41;

 I just went to the beach again in July with Gadgeter  <BR>G and August with my old Hornie. Beaclon didn&#39;t show  <BR>up. I wonder why?

I did some digging over at GameFAQs and it looks like plenty of people are having the same problem. Apparently, it simply changes its location from the western side to the eastern side, but I can&#39;t tell for sure.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try again later.

 I -think- the book here says that if you fail, he moves to point number 2 on the map.  Point number 2 is near the north-heading path on the eastern side.  Head east from the start, then head north at the opening.  the spot should be to the left of that path. &#40;turning right would get you to the gravestone&#41;

Well, I sent my Gadgeter G over there again in June and couldn&#39;t find it on the eastern or western parts of the map. I&#39;m starting to wonder if this is a bug.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try again shortly. <BR> <BR>In the meantime, didn&#39;t the guide mention anything about whether or not it&#39;s available every year, or every other year, or something to that effect?

 Now that you say that, it appears that the last sentence in the description on the map could indicate that you have to wait 2 years.   <BR> <BR>  My rough estimate is that it says &#34;If you fail, you must wait 2 years to try again.&#34;  &#40;if I understand the kanji correctly&#41;

 Well, that&#39;s kind of reassuring. I could have sworn this was the  <BR>second year, but I never made a note of it.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll focus on unlocking all the other breeds in the meantime, then  <BR>combine my Hornie with something and try again next year.  <BR> <BR>Has anyone else here had this problem?

 yeah...same thing for me...I could have sworn I waited 2 years and tried again...but couldnt find him at that 2nd point. <BR>I will just wait another year and try again.

I waited another year and searched the whole map, but he wasn&#39;t anywhere to be found. Unless there are any other possible translations for the Beaclon unlocking requirements, I think it very well might be a glitch that&#39;s preventing me from meeting him again. <BR> <BR>The only thing I can think of that might work is if I send a monster over in February. If that doesn&#39;t work, I may have to start a new game.

 yeah...same for me again...I waited another year and searched the entire map twice...and nothing...  :-&#40; <BR>I had the Bluzzard as my monster,he was high in Int. but I had also raised his power to around 450 so I dont know if my monster made the difference in why it didnt work... <BR>my son unlocked it on his first attempt...  err!!

 Having exactly the same problem, my Pixie failed  <BR>to unlock Beaclon, so I started raising a Durahan,  <BR>and it&#39;s been three years and there&#39;s still no  <BR>Beaclon. <BR> <BR>I had my friend read some Japanese sites about it,  <BR>and he found plenty of people responding to the  <BR>same problem. He said that out of 20 links, one  <BR>person said that if you fail the Beaclon event, it  <BR>will appear on the beach randomly later. The other  <BR>19 said that you missed it forever. I think it&#39;s  <BR>safe to assume that in the Japanese version,  <BR>failing the Beaclon event means missing it  <BR>forever. <BR> <BR>We can only hope that they fixed this bug in the  <BR>NA version. I&#39;ve given up for now, but I&#39;m going  <BR>to try again in a few years while I wait for any  <BR>other solutions to this problem.

 I searched the beach high and low in every season with monsters of  <BR>every rank for five years straight, and still no Beaclon. There&#39;s no  <BR>doubt in my mind now that if you fail to beat Beaclon, it will never  <BR>return. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s entirely possible that it disappears after you unlock the Magic  <BR>Spell regen method before finding it a second time, but I&#39;m not  <BR>willing to throw away all my progress again just yet. <BR> <BR>I started a new game yesterday. Luckily, I only lost five days of  <BR>progress and am currently raising a sun rank Hornie.

 Sounds like the best practice is to raise a throwaway monster just to get to beaclon.  That way if it fails, you can reset and not care about the penalty.

 I think I got Beaklon on my first try when I was using a Falco/???. <BR>Also I believe that Hornie is the worst monster ever. <BR>So many bad jokes. <BR>&#34;Look at how I raise my Hornie.&#34; <BR>&#34;Wow your Hornie is HUGE!&#34;

 Not quite sure yet, but I strongly believe if you lose to the Beaclon in arm wrestling you lost your chance forever. Personally, I went ahead and ordered a new game vs starting my current one over. I do have a question though. If you lose to the Joker is it the same with Beaclon? Do you lose out on that main breed forever? Also if I posted this in the wrong thread I apologize. I&#39;m new to the &#34;blog&#34; type of deal. Long time fan of MR. Currently watching the anime right now. ^_^
