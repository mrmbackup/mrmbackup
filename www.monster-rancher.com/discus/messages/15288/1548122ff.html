 I haven&#39;t done a ton of exploration but I have noticed a few of the areas have little cut scenes where a monster of some sort is lurking around. I have found 4 of them in the jungle &#40;i think its a naga&#41; and 1 in the ice mountain, its a durahan. From what I have read these dont seem to be part of unlocking them, and I haven&#39;t noticed anything else coming from it, so does anyone know what these events are about?

 Those events actually do have to do with unlocking those breeds.

 ah ok, i was guessing because the helper kept saying something about it being a giant snake. And yea i just found where it was used in unlocking too from another site, thinking it was a naga i looked under there in the unlocking section here and saw it wasn&#39;t related and there wasnt any info listed under unlocking durahan. My apologies, please disregard this topic.

 By the way, Thor, where does the Zan turn up first  <BR>in Kalaragi? I&#39;ve been having trouble spotting him.

 yes...the Zan shows up in the Jungle... <BR>you have to trigger 7 event crystals... <BR>using Thor&#39;s advice in the MRDS2 thread...I walked around in a big circle counter clockwise and triggered all the event crystals..the last one near the waterfall... <BR>by that time he will be tired and give you the sword... <BR>&#40;sry if I answered for Thor,just being helpful&#41;

 Not a problem. =&#41;  We are all here to help. <BR> <BR>  One thing i am going to try is to split the events up into separate Errantries. Zan and Durahan can be difficult on a monster with low life simply because of the running around.  I believe that you can stop the sequence after a few crystals, go home, then come back to finish. <BR> <BR>  Personally, I don&#39;t want to build my super LIFE monster yet, but I want more breeds.  It&#39;s worth a try.

 I can try that out for you if you want, I hit 5 of the spots for zan just wandering around, so it shouldnt be to bad to go and pickup the last 2, ill just have to figure out which im missing. May take me a little while as I am currently at work.

 yeah...my Xenon had around 730 life...even then I got the low life message as I was getting close to the exit after getting the sword... <BR>although he seemed to still have close to a 1/4 of his life meter left...

 realy? thats odd i did almost 2 complete circles in the jungle on my monster and still made it back to camp fine and he only had like 300 life. There could easily be other factors though, i know some monsters prefer diferent climates and things which may play a part in it.

 I dont know if it takes a bit of the life meter down...but I hit a lot of random crystals and got into 2 monster battles....on top of doing the 3 laps around the jungle... <BR>plus I wandered a bit..  :-&#41;

 GM - to answer your original question, the first 4 spots for Zan are sort of interchangeable.  here are the spots &#40;in NO ORDER&#41;- <BR> <BR>1&#41; North of the pond in the square crook of the forest block above it. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Northeast part of the forest block above the pond <BR> <BR>3&#41; In the northern path loop &#40;blocked on either end by obstacles&#41; <BR> <BR>4&#41; In the southern path loop &#40;also blocked by obstacles&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>When you have found the zan in those 4 places, then do these in this order - <BR> <BR>5&#41; just south of the waterfall, close to the small oval of trees. <BR> <BR>6&#41;  Spot in the path just north of the start of the map.  &#40;Northwest of the very small tree clump right at the map&#39;s beginning&#41; <BR> <BR>7&#41; Right at the waterfall.  Slightly north of point 5.

 Well all my testing with returning seems to say that you need to do it all in one go, i know i did the 2 blocked points in the first run but after finding both the other 2 in the second i couldnt get any of the last 3 to trigger.

 Ok change of results, while I had to do the Zan unlock all in one go I successfully got durahan with each step in different errantries. So that one is definatly possible to do in multiple parts. Also As a side note i was under the impression that you had to actually combine a monster with the items to unlock these monsters but after a bit of playing around I have successfully spawned several zans and durahans without ever using their items as combination materials.

 Once you receive the item, the breed is unlocked.  You don&#39;t need to use the items.  That&#39;s why I specifically say &#34;You receive item X and breed X is unlocked&#34; in the Unlocking threads.  The breed is unlocked as soon as you complete the event.

 The combination items are much more useful when you make a strong combo.  The result is a pure breed with great stats.

 Yea I am going to do that with to make the durahan I think, my Golem and Piroro/mochi dont have any combinations I like. I just realized I wasted my beaklon item too, is there any way to get a second of these event items? i know you can beat the dragon tourny again but for these are they one shot deals?
