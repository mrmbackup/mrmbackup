 Well, I&#39;ve not had much to do these last couple of days. So, I&#39;ve been experimenting with different monsters, trying to see if the breed of the monster makes a difference in errantries. <BR> <BR>This is what I&#39;ve found/gotten so far. <BR> <BR>1. Breed does matter when choosing an errantry monster. <BR>2. Intelligence plays a very minor, if any role at all. <BR>3. I believe loyalty is key <BR>4. I believe that discipline means very little. <BR> <BR>The reasons behind this are as follows. <BR> <BR>I made a total of six monster; Snowball &#40;Tiger/Xenon&#41;, Pandibaku &#40;Baku/???&#41;, Falco &#40;Falco/falco&#41;, Dragon &#40;Dragon/Dragon&#41;, Ogyo &#40;Ogyo/Ogyo&#41; and Piroro &#40;Piroro/Piroro&#41;. <BR> <BR>Snowball <BR>POW: 999 <BR>INT: 89 <BR>Ski: 999 <BR>Spd: 999 <BR>Def: 704 <BR>Lif: 828 <BR> <BR>Pandibaku <BR>POW: 999 <BR>Int: 134 <BR>Ski: 800 <BR>Spd: 213 <BR>Def: 999 <BR>Lif: 999 <BR> <BR>Falco <BR>Pow: 317 <BR>Int: 703 <BR>Ski: 999 <BR>Spd: 645 <BR>Def: 999 <BR>Lif: 999 <BR> <BR>Dragon <BR>Pow: 310 <BR>Int: 999 <BR>Ski: 999 <BR>Spd: 145 <BR>Def: 890 <BR>Lif: 879 <BR> <BR>Ogyo <BR>Pow: 116 <BR>Int: 999 <BR>Ski: 873 <BR>Spd: 176 <BR>Def: 891 <BR>Lif: 999 <BR> <BR>Piroro <BR>Pow: 227 <BR>Int: 999 <BR>Ski: 999 <BR>Spd: 138 <BR>Def: 810 <BR>Lif: 765 <BR> <BR>Each of these Monsters had Soulmate loyalty, Lax discipline, normal form. Each were 1st gen monsters straight from the book, each got the zero rest raising method using lots of items. I also did not start errantries on any of these monsters until 2yrs and 10months old, at which time there stats were obviously lower than those above. <BR> <BR>Anyway, this is what I experienced from each monster. <BR> <BR>Snowball : Fantastic monster, very little trouble out of him. When I would continually mark a spot he would make his way there with minimal fuss. <BR> <BR>Pandibaku : Another good monster, but not as good as Snowball. He generally listened to everything, but would wander his own way occasionally. However, I never had a problem getting him to event crystals/item crystals. <BR> <BR>Dragon : Barely a step down from Pandibaku, this guy listened fairly well too. Only had a few headaches with him, but not enough to make me not want to raise another for errantries. <BR> <BR>Falco : This guy was... how should I say, difficult. He would listen some times, go his own way others. Maneuvering him around was a headache, but not nearly as bad as the Ogyo or Piroro.  <BR> <BR>Ogyo : I managed to get where I wanted to go, but it was long and frustrating. Nearly lost this monster twice to running out of life because it wouldn&#39;t listen. <BR> <BR>Piroro : Takes the cake in bad. Never listened to me, wouldn&#39;t go after items most of the time, even when it was the one that discovered them. I really would do not want to raise another of these for errantries. <BR> <BR>I know that not everyone will have the exact same results as me, but this is at very least the results I got after these last couple of days of working with them. If I get bored enough to conduct another string of errantry experiments I&#39;ll list them up in this thread, but for now I&#39;ll leave it at this.

 My first monster was a piroro, and I had a fair bit of trouble controlling it aswell, though I still managed to get zan with it. My golem seems to generally go where i want.

 The Abyss I just raised &#40;abyss/abyss&#41; was very finicky. He didn&#39;t have trouble going after the crystals once he found them, but he would only follow my directions about 1/3 of the time. Often he would just sit there or go off in some random direction of his choosing. <BR>He had high wits and bonding and his major stats were intelligence, skill, and speed. &#40;if it makes any difference&#41;

 I took a Pink Eye out. He was perceptive, finding a lot of things, but easily distracted from going to actually get them. <BR> <BR>I also had a Durahan/Pancho that I had okay results with. He didn&#39;t find a whole lot, but he did okay. He would always either go directly towards where I said to go, or directly away. No inbetweens at all.

 The piroro I had &#40;piroro/tiger&#41; wasn&#39;t too much trouble. She wasn&#39;t completely no trouble, but it wasn&#39;t as bad as the abyss I raised. When she went the wrong way it was usually the direct opposite way she was going, so it seemed like she was scared and was running away instead of just not following direction. <BR> <BR>Pixie/piroro was pretty good, only occasionally going in the wrong direction. She sometimes got distracted, but was pretty fast to change directions back to where I was pointing at.
