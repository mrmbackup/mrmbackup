 Well, I am having difficulty getting a variety of monsters.  I still haven&#39;t found a decent starting monster yet because of it.  I have only tried Drawings for now and will be doing some spoken words  as soon as I get some time alone.  Also,  I have noticed that there is no option for handwriting recognition like the advertisements have all demonstrated.  Is this supposed to be an unlockable option?  Also, what about GBA carts?  Is this still here?  I haven&#39;t seen it yet if it is.  I am guessing that increasing your breeder rank may open up more options  &#40;or at least I am Hopeful of it..&#41;

 I don&#39;t think the GBA carts are an option at all. <BR> <BR>-Actually, drawing parallel lines starting in various spots, with various inclinations, has gotten me almost every main type.

 If you can&#39;t find it, then I think it must require you to raise your breeder rank.

 I saw a note on the official site that essentially said that beginner players cannot do the handwriting, so that must be it.   <BR> <BR>  So now I am wondering what the &#39;special treat&#34; for MFDS owners is supposed to be.  Unless there is some way for the game to know you have the cartridge for MFDS, how is it supposed to give you a bonus? <BR> <BR>  I spent another 3 hours yesterday generating monsters.  I stopped once I finally got a Tiger.  I haven&#39;t had a message at all saying that I didn&#39;t have permission for a monster which has me wondering about 2 possibilities - 1&#41; Unlockable monsters cannot be attained through Speech or Drawing or 2&#41; There is no more permission message and they replace your monster with something you already have available. <BR> <BR>  The reason I say #2 is a possibility is because I got a LOT of the SAME monster from vastly different drawings.  Of the literally hundreds of drawings I did, I got the same Mew &#40;Mew/Abisu&#41;, Pancho &#40;Pancho.Lesione&#41;, and Baku &#40;Baku/Lesione&#41; over 20 times each.  The same thing happened with spoken words.  I tried 121 words and got the same Mocchi &#40;Mocchi/Ducken&#41;23 times and a couple of others around 15 times each. <BR> <BR>  So, you can see why I may sound a little frustrated. <BR> <BR>  Also, I haven&#39;t found a single special monster.  With MFDS, I got my first special monster within 15 tries &#40;Mahjong - Colorpandora/????&#41;.  I also noticed that I haven&#39;t seen any Modoki monsters, even though I saw one fighting on the demo screen.  Modoki was always one of those indicators inMFDS that said &#34;hey you are really close to getting a good monster of this type&#34; when you were drawing.

 Something else I noticed is that I didn&#39;t get any sub-breeds of locked monsters either.  I thought this might be because you could create a pure monster out of two identical subbreeds, but I am wrong. &#40;Example, in MR1, if you had a Dragon/Golem and a Pixie/Golem then there was  chance of getting a pure golem.&#41;  It appears that when you combine two monsters, the main breed of the baby has to be one of the main breeds of its parents.

 Last night, I tried doing a lot of drawing, too. I get Ducken/Abisu a lot as well as those mentioned. There are a few types that I have seen only once or twice &#40;Pure Pixie, Pixie/Suezo, Mew/Ducken&#41; and sme I see a lot. Sometimes, doing what seemed like the same thing made different monsters. Some other things &#40;blacking out ¼ of the screen in a stripe&#41; seemed to make the same monster over and over.
