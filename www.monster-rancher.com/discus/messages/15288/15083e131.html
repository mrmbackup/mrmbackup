 In searching the web for info, I came across a complete page of cheat codes.  Now, cheating is not how I want to play, but the information here is rather valuable. <BR> <BR>1&#41;  There is a code that is called the &#34;Limit Exceeding Flag&#34;.  this is the flag that must be set to go past 999 in a stat.  This tells me that there is a way to get permission to go beyond. <BR> <BR>2&#41;  In the document under note #1, it says that stat maximums are 999, but if the flag above is set to 1, then the stat max is 1500.  &#40;I am fairly sure that the composite cap of 6000 is still in place&#41; <BR> <BR>3&#41;  The item list has 29 Stone Chips, one for each of the main breeds. <BR> <BR>4&#41;  The item list has 12 Star Stones listed.  I can&#39;t help but wonder if the 12 Battle Royal tournaments have events that give you a Star Stone even though the prize is listed is a Stone Chip.  &#40;Perhaps the Star stones are the way unlock the Limit break...&#41; <BR> <BR>5&#41;  The item list has the Music Box and Cricket Chime, which I haven&#39;t found yet.  They would be great assets for the farm.  They may not be in the game anymore but still linger in the list. <BR> <BR>6&#41;  The Item list seems to contain the 5 henger parts.  These are probably a holdover from MFDS1 since the Henger is unlocked directly now.  Also found in there is the Fishbowl, the Mew Doll, Duck Doll <BR> <BR>7&#41;  Monthly feeding items are in the Item list.

Holy grail found!!! <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://mfds2.wiki.fc2.com/" TARGET="_blank">MFDS 2 Wiki</A> <BR> <BR>  This outlines many of the specifics we have been looking for.  Running it through the google translator is not the best way to read it, but it works for the most part. <BR> <BR>EDIT: Link Fixed

 Looking through the Wiki, it appears that the codes for Special monsters are found in the Expeditions when you go there in certain Months. <BR> <BR>  Saltal was fortunate enough to find the Beaklon special because he went to the beach in August.  I was actually about to try every expedition in every month to see what I could find, but this Wiki site will save a lot of that trouble.  I will do a bunch of confirmation of these things and bring the info to this site.

 After some thick reading, it appears that in order to have your monster able to increase their stat limit from 999 to 1500, you must use the Stone Chip for the main breed of your monster when you combine. <BR> <BR> So, if you want a pixie to have 1500 speed, you need to combine monsters to make that pixie and use the Pixie stone as a combining item.  Of course, first you have to win  Pixie stone in one of the Battle Royale tournies.. <BR> <BR>  MFDS2 is definitely a DEEP game.  It&#39;s definitely on par with MFA2.

 Nice legwork, Thorr! You&#39;ve hit the jackpot. And the pot&#39;s a heck of a lot bigger than I expected. <BR> <BR>Regarding the tablet chips, have you found any yet? Also, must both monsters be of the same main breed, or just the offspring? And there&#39;s one for each breed, yes? If so, then perhaps the battle royales yield the star stones? What other tourneys have you seen that give the chips? <BR> <BR>The celestial theme of this game is pretty obvious at this point, isn&#39;t it?

 Ah, yes. Would you mind taking a look at what it says about the wi-fi features?

 Regarding chips - There are actually a LOT of tourneys that have CHips as prizes ranging from class C thru SS.  The wiki has a chart in the Item section that tells you when many of them are available to win.  I will try to convert it to a table here. <BR> <BR>  I haven&#39;t found any simply because I haven&#39;t tried yet.  I&#39;ll look into WiFi, but I don&#39;t think it listed much if anything.

 I got my first chip.  The event afterward says that the composite Stat Cap is 5994.

 Well, how about that? That&#39;s exactly the same stat cap that&#39;s been enforced in almost every game in the series &#40;all 999&#41;. Now at least non-chipped monsters can reach the same stat total and chipped ones.

 I see there are actually 29 battle royale tourneys. Are the twelve tourneys you mentioned earlier any different? <BR> <BR>Also, is it possible that, in order to obtain the star stones, you must raise a zodiac monster?

 I have posted a complete schedule of all the Battle Royale series in the FAQ section. <BR> <BR>  It very well could be that you have to raise a Zodiac monster.  I am starting to unlock them now and will be able to find out at some point. <BR> <BR>  The Zodiac monsters each use a combination of symbols in the first box of the handwriting regen method.  I have seen the code for Zan, but I obviously cannot write it in this forum.  So, I didn&#39;t save my game and now I am going to have to run it through the homebrew and create screenshots of the codes as I get them.  I am going to have to rank on my monster pretty hard in order to get all 12 of them in a single year.
