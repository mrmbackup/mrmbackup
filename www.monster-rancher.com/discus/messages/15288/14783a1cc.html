 Please post any findings on house and barn upgrades, so we know what variables are involved.

 Regarding the monsters locked out due to size, why is Baku the only large monster who isn&#39;t locked?

 I just went thru and updated the list to reflect all the ones that are locked out and added a couple of others to the &#39;available at start&#39; list. <BR> <BR>Baku, Golem, Lesione, and Falco all require a barn upgrade.

 Well, that makes 16 locked out of 29. That&#39;s plenty of locked monsters. Now we&#39;re cooking with gas!

 Oops, sorry. I made that from my book, and I did it after I got the upgrade. <BR> <BR>I started with almost the first monster I shrined.

 Year 1000 - The builder came by on 10/1.  I believe he was just there to introduce himself. <BR> <BR>Year 1001 - The builder came around at around 4/1.  I believe he came by for a story event, though, or maybe just to continue his introduction to say that he got into building.  The head of BOMBA was also there during this event. <BR> <BR>Year 1001 - The builder came by at 10/1 again.  He offered to upgrade my barn for 4000 G.  Then he offered to upgrade my House for 1500G.  I have the money and took him up on the offer.  I will be going back to the shrine to see which monsters I can raise now.  I predict I can raise a Falco and a Lesione, but probably not a Baku or Golem yet.

 Year 1002 - At 10/1 the builder came by again.  I had 42000 gold at the time and was rank B.  He offered to upgrade the house and barn.  The barn cost 8000 and the house cost 4000. <BR> <BR>  Of note, my monster ran away after a tourney and was still missing on 10/1.  The builder still came even though I had no monster there.

 Due to my monster being away for 3 months, I missed my opportunity to test which large monsters were usable at barn level 2...

 YEar 1003 - At 10/1 the builder came by to upgrade again.  I had 35k in gold.  It turns out that in my above posts, I have the prices reversed.  I know this because the first upgrade offered to me cost 30000G!!!  I said Yes and only had 5G left.  He then offered another upgrade for 12000.  I said No because I had no money.  When I got to the farm again, my House had been upgraded but not my barn. <BR> <BR>So, the come-uppance - <BR> <BR>Houses - <BR>lvl 1 - Start  1 item page <BR>lvl 2 - 4000G  2 item pages <BR>lvl 3 - 8000G  3 Item Pages <BR>lvl 4 - 30000G 5 item pages <BR> <BR>Barns - <BR>lvl 1 - Start - small monsters <BR>lvl 2 - 1500G - Falco, Lesione <BR>lvl 3 - 4000G - Golem, Baku <BR>lvl 4 - 12000G - Maybe dragon?

 Argh! I must&#39;ve missed the builder&#39;s first visit, because he didn&#39;t introduce himself until 10/1 1001! <BR> <BR>And it&#39;s 1/1 1002 now, and he hasn&#39;t come back. <BR> <BR>I think I have to wait an entire extra year in order to upgrade because I missed the first date! <BR> <BR>By the way, the builder always comes on &#39;10/1&#39; to upgrade &#40;in case you guys didn&#39;t realize that yet&#41;. <BR>I believe he says so in his introduction.
