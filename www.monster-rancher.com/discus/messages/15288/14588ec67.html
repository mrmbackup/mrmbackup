 I do, but haven&#39;t translated them yet. <BR> <BR>  Lifespan/growth is more complex in MFDS.  Each individual monster has a certain type of lifespan and a certain type of growth pattern.  Also, each monster has their best stat gains during -different- life stages.  I do mean -eah- monster and not just main breeds. <BR> <BR>  Lifespan is listed in this book for each monster with a symbol representing low-high- <BR> <BR>Double circle - Long <BR>Circle - Average <BR>Triangle - a little short <BR>X - short <BR> <BR>  The growth chart has a monster life divided into 4 parts <BR>1&#41; Baby <BR>2&#41; Youth <BR>3&#41; Adult <BR>4&#41; Old Age <BR> <BR>  The chart has 9 different growth patterns.  Each monster has a base of one of these 9 patterns.  For example, the first one translates to &#34;Super Early Maturity&#34; Type.  This growth type has its best stat gains during Youth and its stat gains are very high.  The next one is &#34;Strong Early Maturity&#34; which is identical to the above, but the gains themselves are a bit lower. <BR> <BR>  Each individual monster has its own span and pattern.  However, the 3 phoenixes all have Short lifespan and a growth pattern that peaks in early Adult stage.  The 3 Jokers also have Short lifespan, but their stat gains are at their best from mid-Youth to mid-Adult stages.  All the other monster breeds have a number of sub-breeds possible.  Each combination has their own lifespan and growth pattern. <BR> <BR>  Now Attack charts are different.  Attack charts are by Main Breed only.&amp;#12288;New attacks in MFDS are gained by going to -specific- training locations.  So, you will have to do your technique hunting in different places in order to get all of your moves.  In order to get all of your monster&#39;s attacks, you will definitely have to visit all 5 training grounds. <BR> <BR>  I do intend to get these charts completely translated at some point.  I have just been too busy with real life.  I do carry the book with me everywhere I go just in case I get a chance to make some progress.

 Wow, I never even thought about looking into that. This is even more complex than MR2&#39;s life patterns.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s nice to see that childhood won&#39;t be as uneventful as it used to be.

 Well, there are very few monsters that actually have the Youth gain.  Most monsters have their stat gains in late Youth and Early adulthood. <BR> <BR> In fact, a quick look at all of the listed monsters revealed that only 1 or 2 monsters have the Early-Super pattern.  Many of the Pixies have the Early-Strong pattern..  &#40;The pattern names refer to 1- the prime stat gain time period and 2- the level of their best stat gain.  So an Early-Super monster has their best gain in Youth and their stat gains are at Super level.  Early-strong means that they gain best in Youth and their gains are pretty strong.&#41;

 Wow! <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot!  <BR> <BR>I look forward to seeing these! <BR> <BR>now, with that in mind. <BR> <BR>Which Pixie has highest Lifespan and which one has highest growth rate &#40;Early-Super/Strong&#41;? <BR> <BR>if not pixie the who has Early-super And a 3-4 yr lifespan? <BR> <BR>The Tree has grown twice, if that is a factor.

 All pixies except 130 &#40;Pixie/dragon&#41;and 132 &#40;Pixie/Joker&#41; have normal lifespan.  The aforementioned Pixies have Slightly short. <BR> <BR>No Pixie has early Super, but the following have early Strong: <BR>128 &#40;modoki&#41; <BR>135 &#40;Pure&#41; <BR>136 &#40;Tiger&#41; <BR>138 &#40;Suezo&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>  Information comes from Perfect Guide

 As I stated quite clearly, they have Short life. <BR> <BR> Normal lifespan varies depending on your treatment of the monster.  4 years is a good base.
