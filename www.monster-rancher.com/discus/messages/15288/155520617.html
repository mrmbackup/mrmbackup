 1: I read in a walkthrough that stress/fatigue relievers also cut your monster&#39;s lifespan when used, and it made me wonder: what other items lower lifespan but don&#39;t warn you that they do? Does anybody know if the stat fruits / blade weed / fatty meat cut lifespan? <BR> <BR>2: Jokers &#40;and some other monsters I&#39;ve seen&#41; have stars and &#34;Continuous&#34; as their lifespans. The &#34;Continuous&#34; gives you the impression that it has no end to its lifespan, but that seems rather broken to me, so what does it really mean? <BR> <BR>3: Most normal monster combinations have X as their lifespan symbol. Is that below or above the triangle/single circle?

 1.&#41; That&#39;s not true at all &#40;?&#41;. The stress/fatigue relievers have side effects that affect form and Discipline, but definitely not life span. <BR> <BR>2.&#41; The words in the lifespan description tell its &#39;lifetype&#39;: different lifetypes have different percentages for each stage of its life. For example, a lifetype of &#39;Normal&#39; would have all the stages equally distributed throughout its life, while &#39;Late Bloomer&#39; will mean that its baby stages are longer. For &#39;Continuous&#39;, I&#39;m not really sure, get someone that knows better. <BR> <BR>3.&#41; From what I can infer, X is actually the lowest? Well I keep getting Circles to Stars for Henger combinations, while Xs to Triangles for Dragon, Phoenix and Joker, because the base life span of these monsters are determined by breed.

 Wait, when did I put a question mark on my answer to #1? o_o <BR> <BR>I just tested it out by feeding 500 Honey Shrooms and 500 Sea Angels to my monster &#40;yes I had that much time lol&#41; and Rested it, well it didn&#39;t die, so no.

 1&#41; Those items DO NOT reduce lifespan.  They have other effects that aren&#39;t listed, but lifespan hit is NOT one of them.  Only the items that say so are the ones that reduce lifespan. <BR> <BR>2&#41; You are looking at the Growth Type.  The Lifespan has a symbol.  Growth types are Normal, Early Bloomer, Late Bloomer, and Constant.  Constant growth means that they have a consistent growth during a long prime.  They don&#39;t have as high gains as the other 3 types, but they have them for a longer time. <BR> <BR>3&#41;  X is lowest. From lowest to highest - X, Triangle, Circle, Double circle, Star

 So you mean I was avoiding shrooms and sea angels for nothing? Oi...that was a waste. Well, I know now, thank you for answering. <BR> <BR>Okay, yeah, constant was what I was thinking of. I saw it on a Joker during combination I think. I raise mostly Tigers and Phoenixes so the most I ever get to see is double circles. <BR> <BR>Also, has anyone ever raised a successful Mew? I find them irritatingly difficult to raise for battle. They hate everything except Skill and speed training and most of their techs seem to have crappy hit rates as well. I want to raise one but haven&#39;t made it anywhere beyond the D rank...

 Well my first monster was a mewbat who made it to B rank.  And this was the first mew I attempted to train in any of the MR games &#40;dunno why I never bothered to&#41;.

 Do monsters age while in the freezer? I lost the Big Bang Coliseum with my Bluzzard and I decided to freeze it until next year so I can try again &#40;without having to start with a new monster&#41; but strangely enough, I was given the &#34;your monster needs to retire&#34; message. -_- It should have had a year&#39;s worth of life left when I put it in.

 No, monsters don&#39;t age while frozen.... as far as I know anyway. <BR> <BR>More than likely your monster was ready to retire either before you froze it and didn&#39;t realize or a week or so after. <BR> <BR>Not really sure where you&#39;re basing the year left from, but it&#39;s entirely possible that two monsters of the same species could have very different lifespans based on how they were raised. <BR> <BR>Hope that helps a bit, and if not hopefully you can get a more informed answer soon. :&#41;

 If your Bluzzard is older than 2.5 years, it could be at retirement age easily. Tournaments reduce lifespan, especially if you don&#39;t win.  They only have a 3 year lifespan to start.

 I figured out what it was. I had miscalculated the time that the gold peach gave me. A year is 48 weeks so it only added a year to my Bluzzard&#39;s life. I had calculated two years somehow. <BR> <BR>Also, is there any proven percentages for the &#34;learn technique&#34; quotes that Sapphire gives you? Like &#34;You will most likely learn a new technique this time.&#34; being 70% chance?

 Completely unnecessary necro-post. <BR> <BR>  You have flooded this forum with many, many double posts and useless messages.  As mod for this forum, I am formally warning you. <BR> <BR>  Enthusiasm is great, but posts like the above are just downright stupid.
