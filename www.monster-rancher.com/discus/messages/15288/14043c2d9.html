 I was wrong, i have a Random battle once every year about in the game, And it was a mocchie once, and a  piroro last year. <BR>Im Rasing a Hare/Tiger. I and have notices theres no Trip/extended month of training to learn new moves, atleast from what i can see. <BR> <BR>The name of the Monster Association is BOMBA <BR> <BR>Its Repeated three times in the openning scene of the game as you register at the desk. <BR> <BR>Just Like in the Last couple games.  <BR>The Monster you are rasing expresses an emotional stance andnow has a thought bubble over his head as you choose something to train him in. Right now my Hare/Tiger Doesnt Like Training in something two times in a row. And shows a dislike for any defensive training. <BR> <BR>You start out with only the basic six training options. Strength, Skill, Speed, Defense, Intelligence, Life. Though there are spots for four more options, thier &#34;?&#34; blocks. <BR> <BR>When you look at your ranch, the Top screen looks alot like MR2. But the bottem screen acts like a Radar/map of your land, you can tap at places and he&#39;ll slowly make his way over. Possibly some mini game or item finding method later for those Tree climbers or  Dirt Diggers. <BR> <BR>I find that thres a max of 27 moves for a monster to learn, but that&#39;d be rare, theres 9 slots for  close, Medium, Far Range moves. And in battle you can have two battle bars set. Total of two close, two middle, two far Moves can be brought in to battle on a single monster. <BR> <BR> <BR>The Game has a MR1 Feel to its E arenas. And the enemies aren&#39;t slow to react like they were in MR1. These actually pose some challenge.

 OH and the Training/Travel Agency, Where you can send off your monster to places similarly to MR1. But when starting it. Theres a board game on the bottem of the screen and you see the Map of the place. Aka the Forest on the top. <BR>You get to role the dies once and if he passes the First weeks training, Which consisted of Jumping trees to the next part of the map, you get Stat raises and another turn <BR> <BR>There are four kinds of basic floor pannels to walk acouts. Trianing or no Training &#40;one X&#39;ed&#41;. Roll Die, no Die roll. FAce a Baddie, or a ? mark is the most commen. There Are Dead ends, and chances to get injured on this training trip. <BR> <BR>it cost 2000 to do as well.

Ah, I see. That Training trip must be where you get new techs as  <BR>well. <BR> <BR>I assume it&#39;s still a month long? How tired do your monsters get  <BR>afterwards?

 Okay, training trips are still a month long. <BR>You train one stat &#43; health, depending on which location you go to. They can last a long time if you land on dice spots, or you can get frakked over. I usually end up getting about 150 of the main stat I&#39;m training and like, 60 health. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s also &#39;expeditions&#39;. You control the monster with the stylus, just like on the farm. You find items and end up battling. I&#39;m pretty sure you are able to unlock secret breeds through expeditiousness.

 Yeah, it&#39;s the fourth choice in the town. Inside the building, it&#39;s the first selection. To go on expeditions&#40;the non-training ones&#41;, use the second choice.

 It looks like the DS clock doesn&#39;t necessarily affect the time in- <BR>game all the time. Just when you start it up.  <BR> <BR>Time passes on the ranch and in town, even as the DS is in sleep  <BR>mode. On the ranch, if you wait long enough, a week will pass  <BR>without your doing anything. Fortunately, restarting will bring  <BR>you back to the week you missed so long as you didn&#39;t save. I&#39;m  <BR>not sure if it counts as a Rest or if weeks pass whilst in town.  <BR>Can someone confirm this? <BR> <BR>Fret not, those whom like to remain idle occasionally whilst  <BR>playing. Whenever you save, you&#39;re taken back to the title  <BR>screen, where weeks do not pass at all. I assume that&#39;s the  <BR>reason they made the save feature like that, and why your  <BR>monster is shown on the title screen. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try and see how long it takes for a week to pass in the game.

Okay, I&#39;ve looked into it, and it&#39;s actually quite interesting.  <BR> <BR>The game&#39;s weeks consist of seven days, Monday through Sunday. It is depicted as a Kanji symbol in parentheses next to the date. At the start of the week, it will usually be rather early in the morning. While you&#39;re on the ranch or in town, time will pass very gradually. Once the day/night dial goes slightly past night-time, a day will have passed. If it&#39;s the last day of the week, the following week will start. Time does not pass while your assistant is talking, an event is occuring, or whilst shopping and shrining. Things like checking your monster&#39;s status or the book will also halt the passage of time. <BR> <BR>This basically encourages you to explore the ranch with your monster for nifty little trinkets.  <BR> <BR>Speaking of that, if your monster is disloyal, it you will have a hard time getting it to go where you want it to. It&#39;s recommended that you avoid going on Ventures until your monster gains a bit of loyalty, as the Venture maps function in much the same manner as the ranch, only items tend to be visible more often and your monster&#39;s stamina shows you how much time you&#39;ve got left as opposed to the days of the week.

 I created a monster for the sole purpose of excavating items. He had a little trouble following my orders, but I didn&#39;t care about his health and forced him to keep going after he had run out of stamina. He keeps going for quite a while, and then fades away. It will appear as if he&#39;s dead back at the farm, but he comes back in a month or so. Interesting.

Apparently, days last for at least five minutes in-game. And after a drill or rest, you wake up Monday morning. <BR> <BR>When you continue your saved game, the time of day and day of the week will be the same as it is on the DS&#39; internal clock, regardless of what time or day it was in-game when you saved.

I&#39;m surprised no one&#39;s mentioned this, but not only do you celebrate your monster&#39;s birthday, you celebrate your own birthday as well! Your assistant sings for you, and your monster gives you a gift. Isn&#39;t that cute? <BR> <BR>Speaking of your assistant, what&#39;s her name, anyway?

 I checked. Her name&#39;s Ruriru, and her owl partner&#39;s called Yushikii. <BR> <BR>During the last few weeks of my first monster&#39;s life, I wanted to get  <BR>one last bit of use out of him, so I competed in a lower ranked A  <BR>tourney.

 An observation on Time passage - <BR> <BR>  If you are on the ranch and close your DS cover, the game doesn&#39;t go into Pause mode, as you mentioned earlier.  However, if you want to force it to go into pause mode, simply open up a menu item and then close your DS cover.  It will then go into Pause mode properly. <BR> <BR>  Also, it is safe to close up your DS cover during a tournament.  I closed mine up for a few hours during a round robin tourney &#40;between rounds..&#41; and picked it up later without issue.

 That tells you that the monster is probably going to prefer that training.  When you select training for a monster, a note symbol will appear over their head if they prefer that.  But, the three dots thing happens when you are selecting a recent trainign that they liked.  It&#39;s a hint to keep doing it.

 I found the exact answer in the guide - <BR> <BR>&#34;This icon means you chose this training last time.  If you choose it this time, the monsters Sensitivity will go down a little.&#34; <BR> <BR>  This indicates that repetitive training will make the monster perform less well.  You want to keep the monster&#39;s sensitivity as high as you can.  I believe that in the menus I call this one &#34;temperment&#34;, but I should change it to sensitivity.
