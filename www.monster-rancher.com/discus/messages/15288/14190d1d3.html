<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'gm'-!>
The tree on the south-eastern edge of the farm appears to have a great deal of significance. According to a few random reports, monsters live around two and a half years tops initially. However, upon &#34;upgrading&#34; the tree &#40;which I shall refer to from hereonin as &#34;The Tree&#34;&#41; courtesy of the mysterious merchant for 2000G, monsters allegedly end up living for a whole year longer. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve yet to confirm this myself, as my The Tree is still a little squirt. As soon as I get the opportunity, I plan on testing it. But it&#39;ll be a while. <BR> <BR>In addition, the life peaches have apparently returned to the series according to two accounts I&#39;ve read. Has anyone managed to find any strange peach-y things that appear to be somewhat peculiar? <BR> <BR>On an unrelated note, I have to admit, there&#39;s a surprising number of people playing this import that haven&#39;t played MR before abouts the web. That&#39;s a good sign if there ever was one. More people at my other community appear to be interested in the game, too.

 I&#39;ve upgraded the tree once. I hope it increases the lifespan. That&#39;s a pretty cool idea.

 It turns out that the The Tree doesn&#39;t require cash to upgrade. As  <BR>the years go by, it&#39;ll grow all on it&#39;s own. <BR> <BR>My first monster, Kwagwar the Hornie, has lived far, far longer than  <BR>I expected. I got a number of retirement warnings at 2 1/2 years of  <BR>age, but my The Tree grew during this period, and my monster has  <BR>lived for a solid 3 years and 8 months, though he&#39;s in his twilight  <BR>period now. Shame he ended up with an extra year or so of old as  <BR>opposed to prime, but what can you do? At least my future  <BR>monsters will likely enjoy more fruitful primes!

 Well, Kwagwar&#39;s popped it. He had a surprisingly long life of 4  <BR>years, 3 months and 2 weeks, even after being tired and stressed a  <BR>number of times. <BR> <BR>I did a quick rest test to see how long it would live before  <BR>competing in a tourney, and it ended up dying at 4 years, 3 months  <BR>and 3 weeks. The tourney was a 6 monster round robin  <BR>competition.  <BR> <BR>Looks like tournaments appear to shave one week off lifespan.

 Wow, touring abroad certainly cuts down your Internet time! <BR> <BR>Anyway, I was raising my Mahjongkoro, which is now a geezer&#40;s&#40;?&#41;&#41;, and noticed that it hit prime around the same time as my first monster, in spite of the extended lifespan. Its statgains started dropping significantly around 2 years of age. However, sometime later, my The Tree grew AGAIN. It&#39;s now very large and healthy-looking! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m quite certain that the first The Tree upgrade extends your monsters&#39; lifespan, yet doesn&#39;t change the lifetime gains much, if at all. However, this second upgrade might make its prime longer. I&#39;ll find out with my next monster. Hopefully I may end up getting at least one more growth spurt out of my The Tree.

 Alright, I&#39;ve tested it, and not only does the second The Tree  <BR>upgrade extend the monster&#39;s prime, it also increased the drill  <BR>gains. <BR> <BR>My Errantry maxxing Guinea-Zo, Minda &#40;Suezo/Pixie&#41;, hit prime  <BR>about six or seven months later than both of my previous  <BR>monsters. Also, she got gains up up to 28 in individual stats at  <BR>the peak of prime during hard drills and Errantry, usually with  <BR>the monster&#39;s primary stat &#40;Int&#41;. The highest I ever got with the  <BR>other two was 23 or 24. <BR> <BR>It seems that in order for your The Tree to grow, you must raise  <BR>a monster &#39;till it nears its twilight years. While it may botch  <BR>combination efforts, you will get far better results with later  <BR>monsters after a couple of spurts. So raise a couple of sacrificial  <BR>lambs whenever you can!

 May or may not be significant - <BR>My Tree grew on my monster&#39;s 3rd birthday.  It is my first monster and she has been going since the beginning of the game &#40;no actual time spent in the freezer.  Only a few pauses while I tried to generate some new monsters.&#41;

 That&#39;s about the same time my tree got its first growth spurt. It  <BR>seems pretty consistent.
