Oh man, where do I start... I&#39;ve encountered so much hindrances in this game, and I&#39;ve been longing to ask questions, but I only remembered about these archives about 3 days ago so... yeah. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll be splitting my questions into &#39;events&#39; since these issues are entangled in certain points in my game that seemed to have triggered a lot of these issues... <BR> <BR>---The 4th week of June Incident--- <BR>1.&#41;First, I already finished the Big Bang Coliseum. Realizing how Platinum gives a wooping 30000G, I&#39;ve reverted my money-making schedule by just simply entering this tournament once every year &#40;46000G should be enough to fund a growing monster for around 3/4 of the entire year&#41;. So I brought out my HuskyGill, my 2nd monster, who was also the same one who finished the BBC for me, to nab me another heaping of cash. Of course the usual Freeze-Save workaround &#40;which I don&#39;t think is actually working, discussed later below&#41;, and off I go to try and win BBC. Fortunately, I did! <BR>But here&#39;s the thing: <B>it was still the 4th week of June after winning the tournament!</B> My monster received fatigue like it was supposed to, I didn&#39;t get to feed it food since it wasn&#39;t the 1st week of the month, but <B>I can actually enter the tournament again!</B> I looked at the day carefully; it was still around 16:00 of Monday. To add, Colt actually came in and told me that there was a sale in the market this week &#40;but before the tournament, there wasn&#39;t&#41;. This is completely odd, but this is a VERY game-breaking way of making money! Provided that if one wanted to keep saving after every tourney &#40;since losing the tourney would put you in July 1st week&#41;, one can actually win this tournament to up to 6 times, and win as much as 276000G! Now if one was actually confident about their monster winning BBC, they can just keep racing against time, taking around one hour to feed their monster 2 Shrooms before entering again, it just might be possible to reach the maximum amount of money! Anyone know about this? <BR>2.&#41; Though that doesn&#39;t mean your monster is safe from life loss. My monster died after the 3rd time I repeated BBC, possibly due to battles decreasing lifespan as obvious. &#40;yeah, she was pretty old...&#41; <BR>3.&#41; Now for some rantings: am I really just unlucky that <B>Centauros just keeps hitting me with Smash 100% of the time now even with only a hit rate of 25%?</B> It is really the only thing that&#39;s making me reset on this tournament, as his Smash deals around 950-1200 damage on my HuskyGill &#40;only has 400 Power and around 470 Def, other 4 are 999&#41;, and oddly enough it just keeps hitting me. On the other hand, my Energy Wave, supposedly 53% hit rate, seems as if it only has 25% hit rate as I only actually get to hit it around 1/4 of the time &#40;though Focus gets activateted after that so I clobber Centauros with it&#41;. This leads me to think that unlike in the previous games, Speed is becoming the least significant stat in this game now &#40;my Lesione who has 63 Speed only takes a 33% chance to get hit by a Bite from a Tiger with 500 Skill with no defense panels on&#41;, whereas in the classics like MR2, having a Ski-Spe difference of around 400 pretty much makes the match too decisive, which I&#39;ve gotten used to, but apparently it&#39;s been reversed here. Anyone else not liking this? <BR>3.&#41; In relation to this 4th week of June incident, exactly 1 year before these events &#40;none of the two monsters that are going to specified here have been moved even a week&#41;, I tried combining Deuoieu &#40;the HuskyGill&#41; and my first monster Oki &#40;a Flazer, whose stats only had around 900 in Power, 450 in Ski and Lif, and pretty much 200-300 in the others&#41; and tested the production of a Tiger-ish. To my surprise it sprouted great results: 300&#43; on Pow and Ski, even around 280 on Int, and the rest are around 200&#43; except Defense which seemed to have been at 190 only. Amazed, I waited for the day that I needed to combine Deuoieu and proceed with my next monster as a Tiger-ish. That week happened to be exactly at this moment that I grinded her at BBC, so I tried comibining them again, and to my surprise... <B>these stats were now much lower!</B> Power and Skill now results in 290, and in general all the other stats are missing around 20-30 points! What is this?! There are only two things I can think of that caused this: age, or AP. In some other thread I read here, age seemed to be insignificant now in MRDS/MFDS2, so I can only think of AP being the most probable reason as to why this has occurred... does this then mean that the freeze-save workaround does not work? Or did I overlook another factor? Guess it&#39;s too late now and the Parameters are now just a pink arrow to the right... ugh T_T <BR> <BR>---Lesiones and the Sea Angels conspiracy--- <BR>1.&#41;This is the one time I can say that I have failed to raise a monster in my entire life as an MR player. When it was born, Apflgnh, my Lesione,  seem to have their like set to Sea Angel or something, which could prove to be useful. But I noticed that after some months, its like and dislikes suddenly changed, and now Sea Angel is at its dislikes. At first I didn&#39;t mind this and just went on using Shroom-Angel, and on the next sale I restocked my entire storage with shroom-Angel as well, and would be a waste if I don&#39;t use it. But as it was getting near prime, I notice that it&#39;s already reached Spartan, and what&#39;s worse, it&#39;s Trust has fallen down all the way from Partner to Enemy. I am trying my best to compensate for this by using 2 Elixirs instead of 1 Sea Angel, but apparently 2 Elixirs have less effect than 1 Sea Angel, and 2 Elixirs is making my Lesione really, really fat. I have spent too much money on Blade Weeds and Roll Cakes. To note, it is still failing horribly in Hard Drills &#40;the &#39;didn&#39;t do it&#39;s best&#39; one, not the &#39;wasn&#39;t successful&#39; one&#41;, so as it stepped on prime &#40;its trust was now Friend, but it has eaten up much of my money in that it is now financially supporting itself&#41;, I actually took a record of how much failures it&#39;s gonna get. And to my dismay, <B>it has actually failed 44.44% of the trainings I have given it in a year in its prime</B>. It has also become stressed out a total of 3 times in that year, meaning that 2 Elixirs seem to not be doing the trick... Now I am really hopeless on this Lesione, it is still failing so much, and I think it&#39;s because I keep feeding it Sea Angels early. Oh yeah, I just forgot, when I saw its dislike switch away from Sea Angels, I tried Sea Angels again, but it still doesn&#39;t like them. And in 2 weeks time its Dislike suddenly became Sea Angel again...! What?! Lesiones also don&#39;t like Tofu and Tablet. <BR>Is it really this difficult to raise a Lesione?! It has in total eaten up an excess of 40000G of not Shrooms and Angels/Elixirs...! <BR>2.&#41; Frustrated at how it ate my money, I nabbed the Golden Peach in Volk Magma &#40;first time, so I haven&#39;t unlocked Phoenix&#41; and went home immediately, not unlocking Phoenix. But now I&#39;m worried about the glitchiness of this game; do I still have a chance of unlocking Phoenix? I know you need the Gold Peach to revive it, but I&#39;m not sure how much Gold Peaches are there in Volk Magma, and if they regrow...? <BR> <BR>---Icicle Festival dilemma--- <BR>1.&#41; Well, I was about to ask about this when Sapphire FINALLY invited me to it. But still, the frustration remains: <B>I do not know the exact details to trigger that invitation.</B> Anyone already know the specific requirements? I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t need to get to SS to unlock Icicle Festival... <BR> <BR>...I&#39;m pretty sure I have more questions, but these are all that I remember now. Most breaking discovery though is that Big Bang Coliseum glitch, which I haven&#39;t found anyone taking note of in this site...?

 Oh before I forget, I got the Golden Peach so that I could use it on Deuioeu and make more money out of Big Bang Coliseum for me.

 Feeding a monster something it doesn&#39;t like will consistently lower it&#39;s Trust.  Sounds to me like you are doing precisely that. <BR> <BR> <BR>  As for Icicle Fest, I got my invitation at Breeder Rank S.  I got the invitation in the Summer or Fall, right after I completed one of the Class E/Class D &#34;carnival&#34; tourneys. &#40;I was working to fill my tournament book at the time.&#41; <BR> <BR>  The Big Bang Glitch is interesting.  It hasn&#39;t happened to me.

&#40;...lack of an edit button is orz&#41; <BR> <BR><I>Feeding a monster something it doesn&#39;t like will consistently lower it&#39;s Trust. Sounds to me like you are doing precisely that.</I> <BR> <BR>Yes exactly, but I didn&#39;t know its effects would be as bad as failing hard drills even in prime @_@ Also, even when Sea Angel wasn&#39;t listed as a Dislike, the Lesione seemed to be hating Sea Angels still, making me believe that it&#39;s actually a bit tedious to raise a Lesione.

 Looking in the Perfect Guide.... <BR> <BR>  Lesione breed has Sea Angel as it&#39;s number 1 LIKE...   <BR> <BR>  There is a &#34;scale&#34; of likability for items, just like there is for Food.  Lesione is SUPPOSED to LOVE the Sea Angel.  &#40;I thought I was reading the chart backwards, but I wasn&#39;t&#41; <BR> <BR>  However, The Guide does say that the full effects of Sea Angel are - <BR>Stress - down a lot <BR>Weight - down <BR>Discipline - down

 What the heck, was I just unfortunate that my Lesione had Sea Angel in its dislike PERMANENTLY? <BR> <BR>That was... T_T <BR> <BR>Guess I need to get another Lesione...

Wait... <BR> <BR><I>Discipline - down </I> <BR> <BR>So THIS is what is making them hate me... <BR> <BR>What about the mushroom though, aside from increasing weight and decreasing fatigue?

 Mushroom - <BR>Fatigue - down a lot <BR>Weight - Up <BR>Disicpline - Down <BR> <BR>  The guide recommends using Roll Cake and Candy to offset the discipline issue from using Sea Angels and Mushrooms.

 The Big Bang glitch doesn&#39;t happen the first time  <BR>you compete in the tourney &#40;and for some odd reason,  <BR>you get a stat up fruit instead&#41;, but from the  <BR>second time onward, the week won&#39;t change and you  <BR>can participate again.
