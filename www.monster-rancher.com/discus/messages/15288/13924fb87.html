 Usually one of the first sections we try to put up is the CD/Passwords list for a game, listing all monsters. What do I call this list, since sounds can be used as well as drawings? Is the above title ok?

 How about a slightly different approach for this one? <BR> <BR>One thing we can do is have seperate sections for the three  <BR>different methods of regeneration. We can also be a bit more  <BR>practical and consolidate everything in a &#34;Regeneration List&#34;,  <BR>which would largely be the same but would be significantly  <BR>neater. The only problem would be having to make different  <BR>sections for every monster breed, but that&#39;s a capacity issue.  <BR>What can we get away with? <BR> <BR>If we were to have a single Regeneration List directory without  <BR>the three subdirectories, it&#39;d save lots of bandwidth, but end up  <BR>utterly confusing. However, this can be remedied by taking all  <BR>the submissions and organizing them according to their type.  <BR>It&#39;s a small bit of elbow grease, and I personally consider it to be  <BR>the best option. <BR> <BR>The thing we have to worry about, though, is how to present  <BR>these things. The GBA carts are obvious, but what of sounds and  <BR>images? Images are too much for the board, after all. We also  <BR>have to present the sounds in such a way as to ensure people  <BR>don&#39;t mispronounce them and end up with the wrong monster  <BR>time and time again. That could cause a great deal of  <BR>frustration. Furthermore, what of odd onomotopaeic noises?  <BR>Ideally, an audio file would work, but once again, too much for  <BR>the site. <BR> <BR>I propose a plea of assistance to Mr. Fenrick to host audio and  <BR>image files.

 We can have unlimited sub-categories. Sort of like how, in the existing CD lists, one clicks Pixie and sees all the sub-breeds&#39; names. We can keep going deeper like that.   <BR> <BR>So, with the old CD lists as a reference, we could put two or three &#40;or however-many&#41; sub-categories of regeneration types under each breed. So, for example, when clicking Pixie/Worm a user would see Passwords, GBA Carts, Sketches, Sounds. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;ll be in chat tonight from 8:30pm Pacific til about 10pm Pacific.

test area is up, what do people think? <BR> <BR>The main breeds page will be in alphabetical order. <BR>The subs will be listed by book order &#40;with the book # in parenthsis&#41;. <BR>The creation options will be in the same order under every sub-breed. <BR> <BR>General warning to all new users: <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Do not expect the list to be complete immeditely!

 ok, let me know about any other issues. <BR>Any Moderator can add new monsters to this list, it would be helpful to get started on the known main breeds. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll also set this up for MF:O, as well. <BR> <BR>We&#39;ll probably set up an FAQ section modelled upon the MR2 FAQ section, with an unlocking guide as the first thread.

 I see. Certain parts of the drawing grid correspond to certain  <BR>breeds. I assume something else happens to the grid after you&#39;ve  <BR>risen a rank or two, but I&#39;m not sure what that might be.

 &#42;chuckles&#42; I just played pokemon DS via the internet This morning with a Friend in the Land down under, I live in the center of the United states.

 Anubis!

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m building life or strength, and etc for the other stats. I have yet to fight a battle, cause I have no idea what I&#39;m doing.

 OKAY, The guy on the horse who gives you the Mew doll says &#39;say the name of a country with a strong soccer team&#39;. I tried &#39;Brazil&#39; and &#39;Germany&#39; in a Japanese accent, and &#39;Nippon&#39;&#40;I think that means Japan?&#41;, I got a gold piroro, and some regular Modokis. Then I said &#39;Argentina&#39; in a Japanese accent and got a WICKED Seuzo/? That looks like a baseball.

 Makes sense given the voice recognition software&#39;s development  <BR>for Japanese speakers. <BR> <BR>It looks like, barring the Modoki monsters and that one Tiger,  <BR>virtually all of the secret monsters unlocked thus far came from  <BR>MR4.

 It appears that you are likely to get a monster of a certain species if  <BR>you attempt to draw its face. Tiger got that secret breed, and  <BR>Mocchi, as you said, gave you a special Mocchi. <BR> <BR>Could you possibly try drawing the profiles of other monster  <BR>species in the game to confirm this? <BR> <BR>By the way, what type of secret Mocchi is it?

 Apparently part of a subgroup of pseudomonsters similar to  <BR>NightSickle from MR4. It seems that every breed has one. <BR> <BR>My theory is that if you do a rather unimpressive drawing of a  <BR>monster&#39;s face, you end up with the Modoki monster, and if you  <BR>manage to make a great one, you end up with the real secret breed,  <BR>like Shiro the Tiger/?. <BR> <BR>MFO&#39;s official site confirms that drawing an impressive Tiger face  <BR>nets you a Shiro &#40;When I downloaded the image, the name Shiro  <BR>was part of the file name&#41;.

 Alright, I got a Modokiphoenix from a bunch of random lines. <BR>There&#39;s a B rank tournament, where you fight a Dragon. For winning you get a dragon scale item thing. If you use it in a combination, you get a Dragon/?. I don&#39;t know what it is, because my farm isn&#39;t big enough to make it yet. <BR>I did get another item that gives you a Henger/?.

 When did you unlock Phoenix? Was it when you got that strange  <BR>feather that Rovest found around the start of the new year?

 I didn&#39;t get it from a combination. I drew a bunch of lines by touching the screen at two points at once to make it go all haywire. <BR>I&#39;ve gotten to A rank. <BR>The camo Henger I got was from an item combination. I don&#39;t remember where I got the item from, though. <BR>I think your theory on the crappy faces giving Modokis is right. I tried to replicate the Shiro drawing, and got a Modokitiger. Time to try again.

Nope, there&#39;s still one left. And it appears to be a new one. Its  <BR>silhouette can be found on the back of the box. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve added several new monsters to the regeneration page.

 According to someone over on the GameFAQ.com&#39;s message boards, combining monsters does not always result in higher stats for the combined monster. <BR>From what I understand, it only increases certain stats, dependent on the type of monster. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t confirm this though as I&#39;m probably going to be very busy with school work for the next few days.

 The daisangen looks like the Mahjongkoro from mr4 but it came up  <BR>as #32 on mine, not #33 as its listed on the regeneration page,  <BR>which is why i posted. Could be two different monsters or just an  <BR>error made in recording data, but Daisangen is definatly 32

 Hmm, I just got a Mahjongkoro, and its transliteration is indeed  <BR>Daisangen. Since its number is also 32, Mahjongkoro and  <BR>Daisangen are one and the same.

 I&#39;ve added some more monsters I&#39;ve encounteded in tourneys to  <BR>the regeneration list.

 I am away from my DS right now. The pronunciation would be like game-su my-ah. The a in games wouyld be long like english, the su is sort of short and dropped. Maya is said the same way we say the name of the south american people: my-ah. <BR> <BR>Also try just saying my-ah.

 When I tested it out, I pronounced it as &#34;Gay-musu MAI-ahh&#34;. The the transition between mu and su was fairly quick, so it was more like &#34;Gaym-su&#34;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try again a bit later. Right now I&#39;m focusing on raising my moneymaker Mahjongkoro, Vinnie.

A mokoki monster in MFDS is basically a false monster, or pseudo monster, of a certain breed. They&#39;re all ? subspecies, and have completely blue, silhouette-like bodies. There&#39;s one for every breed, like Suezo-Modoki &#40;Suezo/?&#41;, Dragon-Modoki &#40;Dragon/?&#41; and Zan-Modoki &#40;Zan/?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Their stats are a bit lower than those of the pure breed, and their statgains are quite possibly lower as well &#40;no one&#39;s actually confirmed the latter part&#41;. <BR> <BR>Modoki monsters can only be regenerated via doodle regeneration, usually when you end up making a rather unimpressive portrait of a breed.

 Nightsickle wasn&#39;t a Ripper-Modoki, actually, though it looks quite  <BR>similar to one.

 speaking of the creation list, we should investigate the spoken words regeneration themes, someone could post a list of words in the themes, and others could investigate what the words shrine, and post them, and then we can add them to the regeneration lists.
