 I chose a Dendelion &#40;Tiger/Gali&#41; for this test because it does NOT have Peddy, Cool or Warrior&#39;s Heart and loves meat. These are the ideal circumstances for my test. Also, he loves Power and Skill training, so for the first 4 months that is what I plan to focus on. Below are the results, I plan to continue working with this guy and will record my results. <BR> <BR>Starting Stats <BR>Pow: 200 <BR>Int: 104 <BR>Ski: 168 <BR>Spd: 132 <BR>Def: 104 <BR>Lif: 132 <BR> <BR>Baby Stage: <BR>None <BR>1/1 Power Train: &#43;6 <BR>1/2 Honey Shroom &#43; Power Train: &#43;7 <BR>1/3 Sea Angel &#43; Skill Train: Failed &#40;scolded&#41; <BR>1/4 Honey Shroom &#43; Power Train: &#43;6 <BR> <BR>Meat <BR>2/1 Power Train : &#43;6 <BR>2/2 Sea Angel &#43; Skill Train: Failure &#40;not Scolded&#41; <BR>2/3 Honey Shroom &#43; Skill Train: &#43;5 <BR>2/4 Honey Shrrom &#43; Skill Train: &#43;5 <BR> <BR>Meat <BR>3/1 Honey Shroom &#43; Skill Train: &#43;6 <BR>3/2 Sea Angel &#43; Power Train: &#43;6 &#40;cheated &amp; Scolded&#41; <BR>3/3 Honey Shroom &#43; Power Train: &#43;6 <BR>3/4 Sea Angel &#43; Skill Train: Failure &#40;scolded&#41; <BR> <BR>Meat <BR>4/1 Honey Shroom &#43; Skill train: &#43;8 Excellent &#40;Praised&#41; <BR>4/2 Sea Angel &#43; Power Train: &#43;10 Excellent &#40;Praised&#41; <BR>4/3 Honey Shroom &#43; Power Train: &#43;8 <BR>4/4 Sea Angel &#43; Skill Train: &#43;8 <BR> <BR>New Stats: <BR>Pow: 255 &#43;55 Total <BR>Int: 104 <BR>Ski: 200 &#43;32 Total <BR>Spd: 132 <BR>Def: 104 <BR>Lif: 132 <BR> <BR>So, this is the first 4 months of my new monster&#39;s life. In order to maintain this schedule for an entire year, doing only Light Training, you would need 64800G for items, 3600 for food = 68400G total for the 1st year. However, I usually start Hard Training at 8 months old. I&#39;ll let you know how it goes...

 Just so you know what you can expect from him, the Dandelion has the same life pattern as every tiger.  They peak perfectly in the middle of their life and they peak high. <BR> <BR>  You also didn&#39;t mention if this was a combined monster or a Shrined monster.  You also need to tell us his Potential rank, which is very important. <BR> <BR>  Actually, the starting stats tell me that you shrined him since those are the Book stats on him.  That also means he probably has a 3-star potential.

 Ahh, sorry those details slipped my mind.  <BR> <BR>He is a book monster and has a Sun as his potential. <BR> <BR>Here is the following data I picked up from the rest of his first year:  <BR> <BR>Baby Stage <BR>Meat <BR>5/1 Honey Shroom &#43; Life Train: &#43;5 <BR>5/2 Sea Angel &#43; Life Train: &#43;6 <BR>5/3 Honey Shroom &#43; Life Train: &#43;6 <BR>5/4 Sea Angel &#43; Life Train: &#43;6 <BR> <BR>Meat <BR>6/1 Honey Shroom &#43; Life Train: &#43;6 <BR>6/2 Sea Angel &#43; Life Train: Failure &#40;Scolded&#41; <BR>6/3 Honey Shroom &#43; Life Train: &#43;6 <BR>6/4 Sea Angel &#43; Life Train: &#43;7 <BR> <BR>Meat <BR>7/1 Honey Shroom &#43; Life Training: &#43;8 <BR>7/2 Sea Angel &#43; Life Training: &#43;7 <BR>7/3 Honey Shroom &#43; Life Training: &#43;8 <BR>7/4 Sea Angel &#43; Life Training: &#43;8 <BR> <BR>Meat <BR>8/1 Honey Shroom &#43; Defense Train: Failure &#40;not scolded&#41; <BR>8/2 Sea Angel &#43; Defense Train: &#43;7 Excellent &#40;praised&#41; <BR>8/3 Honey Shroom &#43; Defense Train: &#43;6 <BR>8/4 Sea Angel &#43; Defense Train: &#43;9 Excellent &#40;praised&#41; <BR> <BR>Meat <BR>9/1 Honey Shroom &#43; Hard Power: &#43;17 Power, &#43;5 Life, -1 Int <BR>9/2 Sea Angel &#43; Power Train: &#43;11 <BR>9/3 Honey Shroom &#43; Hard Power: &#43;19 Power, &#43;6 Life, -1 Int <BR>9/4 Sea Angel &#43; Skill Train: &#43;12 Skill Cheated &#40;scolded&#41; <BR> <BR>Meat <BR>10/1 Honey Shroom &#43; Hard Power: &#43;25 Power, &#43;7 Life, -1 Int <BR>10/2 Rest <BR>10/3 Sea Angel &#43; Hard Speed: &#43;16 Speed, &#43;8 Skill, -1 Def <BR>10/4 Honey Shroom &#43; Speed Train: &#43;10 <BR> <BR>Pow: 327 &#43;72 <BR>Int: 101 -3 <BR>Ski: 220 &#43;20 <BR>Spd: 158 &#43;26 <BR>Def: 125 &#43;21 <BR>Lif: 223 &#43;91 <BR> <BR>Meat <BR>11/1 Sea Angel &#43; Defense Drill: &#43;82 Def, 39 Life <BR> <BR>Meat <BR>12/1 Rest <BR>12/2 Sea Angel &#43; Hard Power: &#43;23 Pow, &#43;7 Lif, -1 Int <BR>12/3 Honey Shroom &#43; Skill Train: &#43;11 <BR>12/4 Sea Angel &#43; Hard Power: &#43;25 Pow, &#43;7 Lif, -1 Int <BR> <BR>Okay so now for the Totals of 1 year of training. <BR> <BR>Pow: 375 &#43;175 <BR>Int: 99 -5 <BR>Ski: 231 &#43;63 <BR>Spd: 158 &#43;26 <BR>Def: 207 &#43;103 <BR>Lif: 276 &#43;144 <BR> <BR>These are pretty solid gains, but could be improved by Drilling more often. However, for a nearly pure training schedule it isn&#39;t bad, either. That one drill was thrown in there just for experimenting and seeing what would happen. As expected I had to rest following it, but I have had zero stress problems.  <BR> <BR>Also, he is exactly 1 year old and still has not received the notification of being in his prime.

 Another thing, you didn&#39;t mention if you had all 7 Farm items. <BR> <BR>  Sun potential is great to have as book monster.
