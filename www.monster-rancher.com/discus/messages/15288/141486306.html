Beaklon can then be regenerated at the shrine, but cannot be taken to the ranch until you get the first barn upgrade&#41; <BR> <BR>Dragon &#40;Get a monster to Rank B. Sometime in January. You will be invited to a Rank B Invitational on the 3rd of February, where you will fight a Dragon. Defeat the Dragon to get the Dragon Tusk. Dragon can then be regenerated at the shrine, but cannot be taken to the ranch until you get the second barn upgrade. The item can also be used in combination to give you a Dragon-Modoki &#40;Dragon/?&#41; &#40;NOTE: The Dragon is extremely strong for a B-Rank monster. Be prepared&#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>Ducken &#40;On the forest Venture, knock down and cross the first bridge; on the other side, search the southermost area for a Quack Doll.

At the ranch, the scholar will come over and assemble a Henger Doll using the parts. Henger can then be regenerated at the shrine. The item can be sold for 3000G or used in combination to give you a Hare/Tiger&#41;  <BR> <BR>Joker &#40;On the island Venture, search the easternmost clearing to find a Joker Mask. Joker can then be regenerated at the shrine.

After some elaboration, he will take them. Afterwards, return to the pyramid and search the room where you found the mysterious white shard for a Winged Emblem. At the ranch, the scholar will return to inspect the emblem, explaining its connection with the Xenon monster. Xenon can then be regenerated at the shrine, but cannot be taken to the ranch until you get the first barn upgrade. The item can be sold or used in combination to give you a Suezo/Zan&#41; <BR> <BR>Zan &#40;On the jungle Venture, go to the bottom-right corner of the map and knock down one of the trees blocking your path; after searching the area, a wild Zan will appear.

 I&#39;ve removed the Phoenix&#39;s unlocking condition because the item  <BR>turned out to be a common article and not a Phoenix Feather. <BR> <BR>Will anyone who managed to unlock Phoenix, or any of the other  <BR>monsters on the list without a descriptor, please post the  <BR>conditions here.

 Ogyo I&#39;m able to create now, I didn&#39;t go thru any event to my  <BR>knowledge so it could be rank based &#40;i&#39;m A at the moment&#41;. I got it  <BR>from sound and it was a &#40;ogyo/plant&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also, that third new monster, I made a madoki one of it via  <BR>drawing.

 Alright so i was wrong on the name. It is <BR> <BR>Zenon  <BR>It looks like a musclebound Zan with long ears, giant dragon  <BR>tale, and feathers coming out of its elbows and shoulders &#40;elbow  <BR>feathers larger&#41;. It&#39;s white mainly with yellow feathers and spots  <BR>of red circles at some joints. Also its feet are reptillian looking. <BR> <BR>From my understanding it likes Shipponaa and dislikes  <BR>roozumuun. It starts off with two moves, a close range punch  <BR>and kick. Sorry if my info isn&#39;t crystal clear :P I&#39;m very bad with  <BR>kanji. <BR> <BR>Life: 111 <BR>Power: 134 <BR>Speed:121 <BR>Defence: 121 <BR>Int: 121 <BR>Accuracy: 126

 Major break thru! i was on the verge of unlocking more monsters  <BR>&#40;zan and phoenix&#41; so i was making some combo fodder for  <BR>combinging with items. i did a monster regen by writing, only i  <BR>didn&#39;t write anything and it gave me the xenonmodoki.

 Ok for Zan I got a sheathed sword from the southern forest  <BR>expedition &#40;break down the logs in the corner and  you&#39;ll find it,  <BR>even zan will pop up on screen&#41; use the item in combining to get a  <BR>Zan/faruko.

 Added. <BR> <BR>Alrighty. I&#39;m going to add the monster as Xenon. If you object to the name, Lisa, you can change it back to Zenon, and I will fix up the regeneration sections accordingly.

 Unlocked a phoeni.

 Oh and for the mew. The guy just gave me a mew doll at one point  <BR>&#40;way after i hit A rank&#41; and thus used it in combining to get the  <BR>mew so didn&#39;t need to figure out hint for shrining one.

It appears that Mew is actually unlocked when your monster becomes fairly popular, as the mailman, whom just happens to be the guy on the horse, gives you the doll, which is a gift from a fan, apparently. <BR> <BR>It also appears that Dragon cannot be raised unless you get the second barn upgrade.

 I noticed ducken wasn&#39;t listed up there as locked but i think it is. I  <BR>just got a ducken doll on D ranked forrest with two bridges.

Wait a minute. I&#39;ve noticed rather odd about some of your coincidental unlockings that don&#39;t quite fit. <BR> <BR>So you found what appeared to be a Phoenix Feather, but got an Ambush instead. And when you found a mask-like object, you got a Phoenix. My theory is that you unlocked Phoenix by getting the feather, and Joker by finding the mask, seeing as the criteria for unlocking is simply finding the item.  <BR> <BR>On the other hand, where does Henger factor into the equation? It doesn&#39;t look like you found the Henger Doll on the pyramid Venture, or at least you didn&#39;t mention it. <BR> <BR>I can assume one of two possibilities, barring your finding some sort of item to unlock Henger beforehand: <BR> <BR>1. Increasing your Breeder Rank will allow you access to a couple of breeds which no longer require you to find their item on Ventures. <BR> <BR>2. There&#39;s a small programming error which unlocks the monster, but doesn&#39;t give the right monster in combination. <BR> <BR>In regards to your unlocking of other monsters like Ogyo, I think there&#39;s a possibility that winning a certain unemphasized tournament may have given you the apt item for getting it. But that&#39;s just rash conjecture again on my part. <BR> <BR>Oh! I almost forgot, what&#39;s Joker-Modoki&#39;s book number?

 For henger I made the henger doll from five pieces you find  <BR>there. The beaklon is still locked for me because i keep getting  <BR>one monster breed I can&#39;t shrine. <BR> <BR>There is a chance that for ogyo or xenon that it was an item  <BR>unlocking thing. There was an item I found on erranty that was a  <BR>white crest that sold for 12000 which might be related to xenon  <BR>but thats pure speculation.  <BR> <BR>Joker Modoki is 88. I&#39;ve been combining a lot lately and almost  <BR>have a full list &#40;with probably a couple of mistyped names due to  <BR>not being able to clearly tell what katakana i&#39;m lookin at.  If ya  <BR>want to i can email it to ya. The list goes by the alphabetical  <BR>order the game uses. which helps in guessing what will combine  <BR>but you have to go with the japanese version of the name like  <BR>Raigaa and Nyaa for that to work. anyways all i have left is  <BR>Reshione and Dakken to go thru for combing so i go do that  <BR>now ;D cya

 Incidentally, I found two crests whilst on the pyramid Venture as  <BR>I tried to while away what appeared to be my monster&#39;s end  <BR>days; one red with the image of Phoenix, and one white with  <BR>what appeared to be the image of Xenon. <BR> <BR>The old researcher came over and took them both from me. I  <BR>think I can shrine both Phoenix and Xenon now. I&#39;ll check later. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also found that your monster can learn moves after Venture.  <BR>It happened to me only once, but I didn&#39;t check and had to reset  <BR>later on because of a KO from a wild Kasumi with 998 Lif.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d appreciate it if you could email me the list and/or possibly  <BR>the Japanese alphabetical order of all 24 breeds, if it&#39;s not too  <BR>much trouble.

 I didn&#39;t use anything to combine to get a joker. I just randomly  <BR>made one in the drawing creation mode.

 I&#39;ve unlocked Ogyo. It turns out that the blue pouch you get at the end of the eastern forest Venture nets you one. <BR> <BR>Also, I was a tad mistaken in the case of Xenon. The white shard you get along with the red one does not, in fact, unlock the monster. However, I ended up finding a metalic wing ornament, which I&#39;m not entirely sure was there before. Using that in combination got me Zanzo, but I was able to regenerate Xenon afterwards.

 I got a monster to A rank, and the scholar came and told me to venture in the ruins and let him know what i found. Of course, i got the Henger parts and he assembled the doll. <BR> <BR>Did anyone get the parts at other ranks?

 Well, you can&#39;t actually go there unless you&#39;re at A Rank, but you  <BR>don&#39;t need to wait for the scholar to come over and tell you about  <BR>the parts to find them, or any of the other items for that matter.

 Note on Dragon - <BR>I raised my first monster to rank A.  I froze her before she died and proceeded to start a new monster. <BR>Jan 1 of my first year with my new monster &#40;a shrined Durahan/Joker&#41; I got the invitation to the Dragon tournament.  Apparently, you don&#39;t have to have a monster of rank B to get the invite.  You just have to have a breeder rank of B.  Alternately, the game may know that I still have a qualifying monster available, even though she&#39;s in freezer.. <BR>Also of note, I do have the second barn upgrade &#40;although I haven&#39;t even seen the first House upgrade yet...&#41;. <BR> <BR>  So far, I must say that this game is far less strict than MRA2.  The unlocking procedures seem to be pretty easy.  I really miss the legendary monsters.  However, maybe they are looking at this game like they did MRA1 where they put in a basic game and then made it much more elaborate for MRA2.

 That is indeed the case. They&#39;re laying the groundwork with this  <BR>title. The eventual sequel will likely have much more content. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll add the Beaklon unlocking method a bit later.
