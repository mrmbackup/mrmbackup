 I think it would be a good idea to compile the significant story events in this thread, including the game&#39;s introduction leading up to your starting off at the ranch. If anyone has at least a basic understanding of any events that take place, just post them here.

 The first story event happens when you create a monster.  Once you have decided on a monster to keep, you are challenged to a battle immediately.  This serves as a tutorial on battling in general. <BR> <BR>  However, it introduces you to a character who is your rival, I believe.  Once I took a monster back to the farm, I got a mail invitation on 4/2 to a tourney on 5/1.  On 4/4, the rival character showed up to talk some smack.  The conversation mentioned the tournament quite a bit.  However, when i got to the tourney, i won it without seeing them.  They came to the farm immediately afterward and acted humble.

 After the rival left, I got a visit from Yukkii about something appeared to say a &#34;Star Stone&#34;.  It looks like I am supposed to go after it somehow.  A big mean looking character showed up and I think he said he was looking for it.  I would guess we have to get it before him.

 I have had story events for new rivals.  In the Class D official, there was a Tiger who was there from a rival.  He popped in and said something to me before the final match. <BR> <BR>  A story event happened later that introduced me to the big meanie from earlier and also a more polite new rival.  The polite guy has an Abyss that i met up with in the final match of the class C offical.  The rival said a small piece before the final match.  He beat me by .01% in the final match.

 After defeating the new rival in class C, the big meanie got mad at him.  After resting a week, I got a visit from a hottie in a corset named Crysta.  She had a lot to say, but I was unable to decipher more than her name.

 Of note - I am in year 1003 now and my tree in the corner has grown visibly now.  This tree might be pretty much the same as it was in MFDS in that it&#39;s just there to get you a Beaklon.

 Oh, no. In MFDS, your monsters&#39; lifespan increases as the tree grows. I think it&#39;ll serve the same purpose in this game.

 I never really found any good evidence of that.  The tree is full grown in what 5 years? &#40;Beaklon could be acquired in the year 1005 in MFDS&#41;  Another reason I have my suspicions on that is that the evidence provided in your Tree thread uses monsters that have different lifetime growth patterns &#40;you may remember the chart I posted on that&#41;.  The perfect guide also says absolutely nothing about the tree, which lead me to believe that it doesn&#39;t have any affect on the monsters themselves.  It seems a bit inane to me to have a tree that grows to full size with 1 or 2 monster lifespans have a large effect on monster lifespans... <BR> <BR>  Opinion aside, I am sure the beaklon comes along the same way, but maybe the tree&#39;s growth opens up the Text input to the shrine?  Who knows...

 My mistake, the three monsters you mention in your Tree thread all have the same lifetime growth pattern, but they all have different lifespans.  In particular, the Mahjongkoro has a shorter lifespan than the other 2 suezos.   <BR> <BR>  What I -don&#39;t- remember is if the tree had an event or in-game acknowledgement of its growth.  My tree is MFDS2 grew without anyone taking notice.  If the tree does indeed affect lifespan, then I will only benefit. :&#41;

 After defeating the dragon in the invitational match to unlock the Dragon species, I was given permission to use the handwriting regen method.  The event text seemed to say that I could use 2 characters.  Then a second event told me I could use 3 characters.  However, when I went to the shrine,  I discovered I could use 4 characters.  My first monster was a Lesione/Dragon that popped up when I input &#39;MFDS&#39;.  I tried ABCD and got a &#34;you do not have permission&#34; message... <BR> <BR>  I have a feeling that the speech and drawing methods only produce starting monsters and that unlockable monsters are only found in the text entry.

 In MFDS, your assistant notified you every time your tree grew one stage. The lifespan augmentation was fairly noticeable. When I find the time, I might raise another Hornie to see the difference at this later stage. <BR> <BR>I think that when the event stated you could use two characters, they actually meant you could use two additional characters, then three.

 That was my thought, too. It may have meant that instead of using just one magic square &#40;the drawing tablet&#41; they can add 2 &#40;then 3&#41; squares.

 It seems that there is a rival of some sort at every rank.  In every Class E official, I face the same Mew at the end.  In every class D offical, I face the same Tiger/Abyss at the end.  In every class C official, I see the same Abyss at the end.  Et cetera, ad nauseum. <BR> <BR>  So, the good thing is that there is always a benchmark.  the bad thing is that the benchmark is always higher than the rest of the monster of the same class. <BR> <BR>  Last night, my Class A dragon went to the official A cup to finally get me to class S.  This one went a bit differently.  I actually faced my rival in the second round instead of the last.  Now, my Dragon was no slouch.  INT/STR both at 600&#43; with a Skill of 400.  Speed and Def were low at about 150, and Life was just under 300.  My first match in Class A was with a monster whose stats were -all- above 450.  It was an Abyss.  His skills had 90%&#43; chance to hit me.  I beat him in 2 quick lucky shots.  They were my highest hit% and were at 61%.  Next I faced the new rival.  He had a Zan.  The Zan&#39;s stats were all around 600.  I stood no chance whatsoever but hoped for a miracle.  I was KO&#39;d in one shot.  Ultimately, it killed my Dragon.  &#40;INCREDIBLE loss and major setback for my ranch.&#41;   <BR> <BR>  The Injury system seems to be back with a vengeance.  I thought my monsters ran away, but they was actually injured.  If you are on an expedition and you don&#39;t get your monster back before it it completely exhausted, it suffer an injury.  If you take too much damage &#40;say 35% more than your life total&#41; in a match, your monster will get injured.  Injuries result in a 6-8 week stay in the hospital. My dragon died 2 weeks after his last hospital stay at roughly 3y 7m

 Also of note, I ran into the big meanie after winning the Class B official.  He chewed out his failed assistant &#40;my rival for that class, Crysta&#41; and continued to talk about the Star Stones.  I believe he said he now knows of 5 or that he needs 5 more.

 Class A official tourney is officially too difficult.  The Zan my dragon faced in that cup is very tough.  I did get lucky and get past him.  The final monster is controlled by the big meanie himself.  &#40;It appears his name is Cleopatra, which is weird.&#41;  The final monster for class A is Beaclon/Durahan.  It has a ridiculously high amount of Skill and Def.  Hitting him does little damage.  He was hitting me with a %90&#43; efficiency most of the time.  He had 580 Life, I believe.  It took MANY MANY MANY tried to beat him, but I got lucky and did.  Now I get the joys of Class S.  I can&#39;t imagine what I will be facing.  At least now I can go to the Volcano.

 Class S is ridiculous.  Most of the monsters are toting stats of all 700&#43; with 2-3 of them in the 900s. <BR> <BR>  Beating the Class S tourney will net you the ending credits.  Once the credits are done, you find yourself back at the farm.  You then get a vision of the Monol, Naga, Centaur, and Gali &#40;not Joker or Beaclon&#41; and are visited by one bad-<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> centaur.  He is like the big blue demon of centaurs.  He essentially challenges you.  He is sort like the final characters in the MFA series.  I imagine you have to beat the big four to challenge him. <BR> <BR>  My breeder rank is now SS.  Now, there are 4 tournies on my schedule that are ranked SS dated 12/1, 3/1, 6/1, and 9/1.  The mail lady described them as the big 4. <BR> <BR>  In the Class S official, there is a dragon controlled by Crysta who has a STR of 1024, so the 999 limit must be breachable at some point. <BR> <BR>  Unlike the poster in the general section says, the SS tourneys have nothing to do with the 6 remaining unlockable breeds.  They are the big 4.   I&#39;ll be taking on the first of them right now &#40;12/1&#41; and will report back.  &#40;The prize for the first one is gold nugget and 16000 gold&#41;.

Looks like we&#39;d better start working on those super babies. <BR> <BR>I suspect that breaking the stat limit may require a very high potential rating, statgains, or the offspring of a few generations of experienced monsters. I&#39;ll look into it towards the end of the week.

 To give some credit to the other poster, The 12/1 tourney of the big 4 was 100% Gali monsters.  I think that perhaps the big 4 have opponents consisting of each of the 4 breeds shown in the dream sequence.  I really don&#39;t think they unlock those breeds since they don&#39;t give combination items as rewards.  I&#39;ll see how the 3/1 tourney goes.

 Each of the big 4 is associated a particular character and has a story event with them - <BR> <BR>3/1 - Mysterious Merchant &#40;whose name I forget..&#41; <BR>6/1 - Electra &#40;The lady in yellow who is present at the beginning of the game&#41; <BR>9/1 - Collette &#40;koreto&#41; the mail girl <BR>12/1 - Cleopatra &#40;the big meanie&#41; <BR> <BR>  After winning the big 4,I was given permission to use 6 characters at the shrine.  I think it may really have to do with the fact that I have permission for all the locked monsters now &#40;second tier completed..&#41; <BR> <BR> Maybe now I can get special breeds..

 Oh, I also got an invitation on 9/2 for a Class A tourney on 12/2.  I dug out my Class A pixie and fought in it.  After i won, Sapphire &#40;the BOMBA chick&#41; came to the ranch and seems to say that it&#39;s the qualifying stage of the Battle Royale series.  Now, EVERY month there is a Class SS tourney in the Battle Royale series.  Each on of these tourneys has a monster name - For example, 5/2 is the Beaklon Battle Royale.  I don&#39;t knwo if you need to have a Beaklon to enter, but I do know that the prize for winning is a combination stone.  These are the same as the Cartridge chips in MFDS.  The name of the tourney could indicate the kind of stone you get.

 It looks like I missed out on a bunch of story because of the thick text.  However, it appears that the big bad centaur actually KIDNAPS the four characters I mention above.  When you defeat the Centaur&#39;s monsters, he releases each of those characters.  When they return, they have the combination item you need for the breeds you fought.

 It also appears that the 4 tournaments held by the Centaur are NOT the big 4.  The big 4 tournaments are actually among the 5 tournaments that I still haven&#39;t unlocked.

 Wow, it looks like the only way to unlock the Big 4 is to raise the following monsters - <BR> <BR>Golem <BR>Tiger <BR>Suezo <BR>Hare <BR> <BR>  Apparently, each of them is associated with one tourney in the big 4.  The Wiki I am reading says that Holly &#40;yes, it says Holly - HoRii&#41;  Will visit your ranch and invite you to the tourney when your monster reaches S class. <BR> <BR>  &#40;I wonder if it is the real Holly or if they are referring to another character as Holly.

Holy Zanzo! <BR> <BR>I just compared the katakana of the mail lady&#39;s name to Colt&#39;s from the MR 10th anniversary book, and they&#39;re the same! <BR> <BR>Colt is the mail lady! <BR> <BR>But don&#39;t take my word for it, <A HREF="http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/mfds2/plus/index.html" TARGET="_blank">see for yourself!</A> She&#39;s featured with someone else in the newest wallpaper. But the other person&#39;s not all that important. <BR> <BR>Nope. <BR> <BR>Not at all. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;ve found that BOMBA stands for &#34;Bogon Monster Breeder&#39;s Association&#34;, according to the scary chairwoman&#39;s bio. It also seems that the original chairman, Amino, was removed from his position for whatever reason.

 Since no one&#39;s mentioned it, Colt comes over and sings for your monster on its birthday, just like she did in MR2.

 The scary chairwoman is Sapphire, BTW. <BR> <BR>  I was looking at those wallpapers you posted above and I don;t see where they get the name for the big meanie.  His name is VERY clearly KOREOPATORA &#40;Cleopatra&#41; in every dialogue. It&#39;s not even close to Bancho or Amino. <BR> <BR>  Clare I can see &#40;KoReA&#41;, and Viola I can see &#40;BiORa&#41;.  Colt is KoReTo &#40;Which I translated as Collette because it makes more sense, but for continuity, Colt is used in prior games..&#41; and Holly is HoRiI. <BR> <BR>  There must be another precedent to change Cleopatra into something else.  The site refers to him as Amino on the character list, but he -always- mentions Cleopatra every time I see him. <BR> <BR>  The big bad centaur is named Kentaro.

 The big meanie bears a very strong resemblance to the chairman from MFDS, whose name was also Amino. But you seem fairly certain that his name, at least based on your interactions with him in the game, is Cleopatra. Based on these two facts, I think it&#39;s safe to say that, whilst apparently in hiding, the big meanie is going under an assumed name to hide his true identity.

Oh, yes, for the record, I triple-checked the katakana and found that it definitely isn&#39;t KoReTo, but KoRuTo. The Ru character has two lines, whereas the Re character has one. The middle character in her name has two lines.

 I have confirmed one of the Greatest 4 tourneys. <BR> <BR>Required - Class S Golem <BR> <BR>Holly will visit your your ranch when you achieve Rank S with a Golem.  I didn&#39;t get a lot out of what she said. <BR> <BR>If you are at the ranch with your Golem, Holly will show up on 2/4 to invite you to the Last Battle tourney on 4/4.  This tournament is rank SS and is a one on one battle against a pure breed golem named Golem..  His stats are nearly maxed out with a Str of a little over 1400.

 The B1 tourney is 6 monster Round Robin. Monster number 6 is Holly&#39;s pure-breed tiger.  Most of the monsters are maxed out, but none go too far over 1000 in any one stat.

 Well, I&#39;m winning. <BR> <BR>  I keep starting a new monster for each one of the tourneys. &#40;you kinda have to...&#41;  Super Errantry runs are the way to really get your monster&#39;s stats up.  If I don&#39;t gain at least 200 on one run &#40;8 gains on a primary stat in your monster&#39;s prime&#41;, I reset and try again.   Battles give you gains, but they are random.  For the most part, i go into the battles with High Str/Int of at least 950, High skill, mid-high def and as mush Life as I can.  I try to pick a breed combo that supports that gain pattern.  <BR> <BR>  I have completed the big 4 and am now invited to the Legend Cup on 12/4.  I plan to save the game on the week before and try to win it with each of my qualifying monsters.   <BR> <BR>  My tourney list is now complete &#40;all 100 listed&#41;.  I only have 50/100 won, though.  My book is about 50% complete as well.

 So Last Battle is one-on-one, and the B1 Grand Prix is a six monster round robin. What about the other two? It&#39;d make sense if the Greatest 4 was a four monster round robin, but what about the Winner&#39;s Cup?

 It just occurred to me that, unlike the other games, the Major 4 tourneys in MFDS2 are no longer challenges you must conquer with one monster, but are now breeder-centric challenges you take on one at a time, hence the change from M1 Grand Prix to B1 Grand Prix in the case of the summer tourney. And unless I&#39;m mistaken, the Big Bang challenge fills the Major 4&#39;s old role. That is, unless any monster can be invited to the Major 4 after you&#39;re invited initially by raising the respective prerequisite breeds.

 I tested that theory.  Without the appropriate monster on the ranch at Invite time, I didn;t get the invite. <BR> <BR>  I only tested it once on a late night, so I may be remembering wrong. <BR> <BR>  The Great 4 tournies are really a breeder challenge with 4 of the primary breeds.  You are there to compare with Holly who is a certified master.  &#40;That&#39;s how they strike me..&#41;

 I went to the Legend Cup tournament.  It is a 8 Monster round robin.  The rival monster is a Mocchi/Xenon who appears to be named MoSuTo.  He has 2 stats over 1000 and appears to be a skill based monster.  When you finally get to him, Holly pops up and says &#34;Merry Christmas!&#34;  &#40;That made me laugh.&#41; <BR> <BR>  I haven&#39;t beat him yet.  I have tried 4 times and have been unsuccessful.

 Poritoka is the White Suezo raised by FIMBA, and the strongest FIMBA monster in MR2. You faced off against him in the Legend Cup. I&#39;m very pleased to see that it&#39;s returned, though I&#39;m a little annoyed that it&#39;s now a regular Suezo. <BR> <BR>All of those other monsters were the Major 4 opponents from MR2: Rouge &#40;Plant/Pixie&#41;, Carmine &#40;Joker/Joker in this game, Joker/Dragon in MR2&#41;, Siarra &#40;Pixie/Dragon&#41;, Zelandia &#40;Dragon/Joker&#41; and Loveless &#40;Durahan/Durahan&#41;. Now that is a pleasant surprise. I trust they&#39;ve all been beefed up considerably?

 You can always check their MR2 stats out in the MR2 archive. Based on the stat totals I&#39;m seeing in the book, they must be worlds stronger. For example, Most was all 700&#43; in MR2.

 They may be.  Mostly, the stats are shifted.  For example, Carmine has 2 stats that are over 1000 but his bottom 3 &#40;speed, def, life&#41; and in the 550-600 area.
