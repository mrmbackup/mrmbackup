 Would any of you perfect guide owners be so kind as to post the  <BR>seasons where the drill boards yield the biggest gains?  <BR>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have mine with me at present.

 I think Dendron is pretty good when in the Winter -- When you  <BR>first move, you can immediately go towards the left path. There&#39;s a  <BR>section that is a Dice -&#62; ? -&#62; Dice. You can just keep going back  <BR>and forth between that section and the beginning of the map in  <BR>order to build up a nice stock of dice rolls. <BR> <BR>Kawrea in the Fall is probably the best for the 3 x 3 grid. If you play  <BR>it correctly, most spaces will give you a 50-50 chance of either  <BR>landing on a dice roll or a stat up.

 Once you get Kawrea, the game becomes EZ Mode. <BR> <BR>1&#41; Combine/Shrine a monster in the winter. <BR>2&#41; Raise it normally until 9/1 <BR>3&#41; Drill at Kawrea for all of Fall or until you get 999 life. <BR>4&#41; Profit. <BR> <BR>  Once your monster has life above 750, it will pretty much roll through to class S.  When you have 750&#43; life, you get 3 extra rolls in the drills.  Getting your life up to max right at the time they enter their prime means that every Drill will be MUCH more productive. <BR> <BR>FYI - 3x3 grid means that your favorite numbers become 1,3,5, and 4.  If you are in the middle &#40;the extra roll&#41;, then a 1 3 or 5 will get you to a positive gain.  4 will always get you back to the square you are on.  If you aren&#39;t on the center, a 1 3 or 5 will get you back to the center &#40;depending on which way you are facing, the 1 may not work&#41;.  No matter what, you never need to hit the -1 Roll or the Loss squares.  You can always reach a ? block instead. <BR> <BR>  The serious drawback of the super life gain is that your monster will come back Exhausted and highly stressed.  This will cut its life span a few weeks.  However, 3 weeks of life for 800&#43; Life stat is a trade I will make any day.

 6 on that 3x3 guarantees you land on the same spot also &#40;along with 4&#41; <BR> <BR>for people who don&#39;t know, the 3x3 looks like this: <BR>random ...&#124; negative .&#124; negative <BR>Stat gain &#124; dice gain .&#124; negative <BR>negative .&#124; Stat gain &#124; Random <BR> <BR>the only bad roll you can get is a 2 on the center &#40;where you get random &#40;or negative stat gain if you think random will give you negative dice&#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>as long as you are on a random spot, any roll will get you something good <BR> <BR>as long as you are on a positive gain spot, any roll will get you something good <BR> <BR>as long as you are on the dice gain spot, any roll besides a two will get you something good <BR> <BR>&#40;something good = stat gain or dice gain&#41;

 the Def one is good in the winter because just to the left of the starting place is 2 sections with &#43;roll tiles at the end of pathways, so you can go there get the plus and turn around and go to the other one &#40;or back to the start&#41; and do it all over again. As to the rest of them so far I havent noticed a significant benefit to the recommended seasons as of yet.

 so it&#39;s LIFE that determines dice rolls!  I was wondering what did that.  I knew it had to be a monster stat but not which one.

 The only downside to Dend Winter is how long it takes to get to the sweet spot.  Once you&#39;re there you regularly have a 33% to 50% chance of landing on an extra roll &#40;if you taking the upper path to the left as well, which conveniently dead-ends on an extra&#41;.  The main portion of the path has no drawback squares while the side path &#40;which you only take if you would land on an extra roll&#41; has just a random square and a statloss square. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure what, if anything, is good with Dend Summer though.
