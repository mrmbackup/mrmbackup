After a bit experience with Errantry, I&#39;ve good reason to believe that this just might be the most important part of the game for powering up your monster. <BR> <BR>There are five different locales, each with a set board. At first, you can only access the Int and Pow Errantries, but as your monster goes up in rank, you&#39;ll be able to visit the other three areas. <BR> <BR>Errantry in this game goes about by rolling a die, and moving a number of spaces depending on what you get. An event takes place depending on the space you land on. The spaces and their events are as follows: <BR> <BR> <BR>Blue Space: Training Success &#40;stat boosts depending on the area&#41; <BR> <BR>Bad Blue Space &#40;Marked with an X&#41;: Training Failure &#40;small stat drop&#41;. <BR> <BR>Green Space: Two Extra Turns &#40;compensating for the turn you just used, and giving you one extra&#41; <BR> <BR>Bad Green Space &#40;Marked with an X&#41;: Lose a Turn <BR> <BR>Red Space: Wild Monster Battle <BR> <BR>Question Mark Space: Random Event &#40;from the above&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>The number of turns you get at the start is dependant on your rank. The higher your rank, the more stocked turns you&#39;ll have when you begin. Early on in the game, you&#39;ll have four turns. However, regardless of how many you have to start, the green spaces will increase it.  <BR> <BR>The green spaces in particular are extremely useful. I managed to land on several of them on my last turn to get all the way up to six stocked turns, which I used to buff up my monster. My three-month-old Hornie managed to get a total 40&#43; boost in Int and 11 boost in Lif on a single trip, even after a few Failures &#40;the stat drop is fairly negligible&#41;. Had they all been Successes, it would have exceeded 70 total. <BR> <BR>Naturally, your monster may be able to learn a new skill afterwards. You don&#39;t have to fight or even beat a wild monster to get the move, but it apparently makes it more likely. Getting a number of extra turns and Successes should be sufficient in netting you the new skill. <BR> <BR>I should note that in this game, wild monster battles are no longer won by getting a timeout with the other monster&#39;s health being low. If neither monster is knocked out, regardless of either monster&#39;s health, the battle will be declared a draw and the wild monster will run away. In Errantry, beating a wild monster will give yours a small stat boost corresponding to the locale. <BR> <BR>A useful trick you can use is to tap &#34;A&#34; to spin the die, then tap it again a split second later to get the same thing you got earlier. This apparently works only the first couple of times. But it should help give you a bit of control over your movement until you get more adept at predicting your rolls. A person whom can control the die can theoretically go on forever, boosting a monster&#39;s stats indefinitely. Even in practice, you can get boosts in the high hundreds with a monster in its prime if you&#39;re good.

 I&#39;ve gotten about 110 Attack boost, and like 50 health from one trip. You should wait until your guy is getting good stats from training to do it.

 I think it&#39;s a good time to while away the tiny stat boosts your  <BR>monster gets during infancy and have it reach prime faster.
