 I&#39;m trying to build up a Succubus themed Pixie in Monster Rancher Advance where she focuses on Kiss and Life Steal. However, the descriptions for the characteristics aren&#39;t too clear so I&#39;m hoping for some clarification on them. <BR> <BR>1&#41; Will Eye Charm and Soft Smell only boost Kiss power or will they also affect Guts Down and chance for Addled state? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m pretty sure Kiss is considered a charm move. Monster Rancher Metropolis lists both characteristics as just increasing the power of charming moves. Other FAQs list Soft Smell as also increasing gutsdown but Eye Charm only for power. There is just so much conflicting information so I&#39;m a bit confused. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Will Magic Know boost Life Drain&#39;s power and accuracy? What about for Kiss? <BR> <BR>I know that Life Know increases Life Drain&#39;s power and accuracy. However, I don&#39;t know if Life Drain is still classified as a magical attack. This actually extends to other characters as well; for example, Joker&#39;s draining attack definitely looks like a magical based one. If Life Drain and/or Kiss are still considered magical attacks, then I&#39;d want both knows. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Does Sniper increase the accuracy of Life Drain or Kiss? <BR> <BR>The definition of a projectile is pretty vague. When Pixie uses Kiss, she &#34;throws&#34; a Kiss at the enemy. Is that a projectile by Monster Rancher Advance standards? <BR> <BR>If I posted a question that has been answered elsewhere &#40;I&#39;m pretty sure it wasn&#39;t as I went through nearly all the topics in the Monster Rancher Advance section&#41;, then I apologize for the trouble. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for the help!

 Quick and dirty... <BR> <BR>1&#41; Beats me. <BR>2&#41; I think it only affects Life Drain if you choose to put the magic symbol on the skill. But I&#39;ve been wrong before... <BR>3&#41; By &#34;projectile&#34;, I&#39;m 80-90% sure the game means only spears, rocks, thrown bits of self and other such. The &#34;thrown kiss&#34; is just neat graphics.

 Sensei Le Roof, how does one put a magic symbol on a skill in this game? I didn&#39;t even know there were symbols that indicated attacks of the magical nature. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m probably going to use Eye Charm but neglect Sniper. I&#39;m still unsure as to Magic Know. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the speedy reply!

 It&#39;s been a while since I played it, but... if memory serves, you do it in the Skills &#34;tab&#34; of the monster stats.

 I think I&#39;ve tried all the buttons in the skills section, but am unable to find a method of placing a magic symbol on a skill. <BR> <BR>From the skills tab: <BR>L does nothing <BR>R does nothing <BR>Up does nothing <BR>Right moves the cursor to a skill to the right <BR>Left moves the cursor to a skill to the left <BR>Down goes to the Monster Tab <BR>Select gives me information about the skills tab <BR>Start does nothing <BR>A selects the skill; see below <BR>B cancels the screen <BR> <BR>After pressing A from the skills tab: <BR>L does nothing <BR>R does nothing <BR>Up does nothing <BR>Left moves the cursor to a skill to the left <BR>Right moves the cursor a skill to the right <BR>Down does nothing <BR>Select does nothing <BR>Start does nothing <BR>A selects the skill and returns to the skills tab <BR>B cancels the screen back to the skills tab <BR> <BR>Either I am missing something or you are thinking of another game &#40;perhaps MRA2 has this feature?&#41;. <BR> <BR>If I can get Life Drain to benefit from two knows, that would be awesome. If not, I&#39;d rather put in another trait. If anyone could confirm the first two questions I&#39;ve asked, that would be great! <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help so far Sensei Le Roof.

 You could just go with a trait good for everyone, like dusk aura.

 Lil_Literalist: <BR> <BR>Dusk Aura is a defensive characteristic that I already have. I am looking to boost my Succubus-themed offense through characteristics in the remaining slots, hence my questions about Eye Charm, Soft Smell, and Magic Know. <BR> <BR>Offensive characteristics are extremely important to me as Life Drain has a D class accuracy. If Life Drain is considered a magic move, then it could benefit from two Knows instead of just one, thereby improving its accuracy and power further. In addition, if Eye Charm and Soft Smell both improve the chance of Kiss causing Addled state as well as Guts Down, then Life Drain&#39;s accuracy would be improved due to both the Addled state and the opponent&#39;s lowered guts. Note that I already have ACT View. <BR> <BR>I would greatly appreciate it if someone could provide me with the exact effects of Eye Charm and Soft Smell as well as whether or not Life Drain is considered a magic move. Thanks a lot in advance.
