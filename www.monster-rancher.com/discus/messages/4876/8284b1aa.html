 Hi! I&#39;ts me Lightning Tiger! Except I changed to Crystal Cheetah... Anyway I noticed something and I also have a question. You can assign an attack to any spot &#40;so a far attack to a near spot&#41;but it will cost you more guts. Anyway, the question is: I was asked to fight &#34;Irassie&#34; for 20,000G. I accepted because I was reading between lines. I just came from a battle and my stats decreased. Now, do the stats decrease only for battle or forever? <BR> <BR>Crystal Cheetah

 The decrease, as I recall, is just for the battle. &#40;ok, I haven&#39;t played for a while!&#41; I do know that you can prevent the drop in stats by having the monster well rested &#40;stress &amp; fatigue free&#41; before fighting. This isn&#39;t always possible, I know.

 Oh, thanks. I just got the game, uhh, yesterday. I just had a stat near 900 decrease to 700 and I wouldn&#39;t want to lose nearly 200 in points. My game turned off because my batteries were almost dead. I got more now. Armed and ready for playing.

 Yeah, I did, too. Half a year ago or more. Then they broke. I&#39;ll be sure to get new ones, though.

 I got these new ones, especially for electronics, called Rayovac Rechargable NiMH. They cost a little more, but they are working a lot better in the GBA then my other batteries. They seem to last longer, and dont have a long weak period at the end. They just give out, which is supposed to be easier on the GBA unit itself.

 Oooooohhhh. I&#39;ll remember that. At least it saves every week for you&#40;which could be bad, I&#39;ve had several times on &#39;special training camp&#39; where I didn&#39;t get anything and I had to restart, but I could say LOADs of good things I&#39;ve noticed&#41;. That way I could play and play and pl......

 Hmm, just wondering here. If you have money but keep feeding your monsters nothing, will you still get the items? Probobly not. Well, if so I could just take one of my old zans that I&#39;ve raised, waste all my money, get items, and, after a while, sell all the items. Then again...

 I have no idea if they will keep giving items. I know that they give items when you do feed them, and you have money.

 Hmm, I&#39;m trying it with NO money right now. I&#39;m using a Diva for training &#40;OK, it&#39;s not really training, after using it for a while I decided to do LD,LD,rest. I KNOW that reduces its &#39;working life&#39; but it was never meant for serious training&#41;. It just gave me a Tapaurin N! Selling the items I got from monsters I can get about 14,000-15,000G. More than I had. Oh well.

 Umm, Just a few notes. TO tell the truth, I&#39;m uhh fooling around. I have no money. My goal is to get 120,000-160,000G in items. I&#39;m gonna raise every special monster to do this. And I&#39;ll uhhh fool around some more! Yeah uhh that&#39;s right! &#42;giggles very nervouly and maniac like&#42;

 Umm, just a question.  Pixie&#39;s stat gains are supposed to stop at around 4y 7m. I used a Dryad, and I trained it by doin LD,rest,LD,rest. I gave it nothing as food, I was &#40;and still am&#41; doing the items. Once I rested it 3 times in a row &#40;instead of rest,LD,rest I did rest,rest,rest because it was stressed&#41; to relieve its stress. It lived &#40;beh, I mean it gained stats&#41; until 5y 1m and 1w. I checked several times to make sure. So Lisa, while I&#39;m playing the game...maybe I should do lifespans for the monsters &#40;with subbreeds&#41;. I just need to know what to do. Oh, I never fought in battles either. Maybe it&#39;s because it&#39;s a spcial...

 Velo only did the pures, not the subs. If you want to test it, just get a monster, write down the date it was shrined on, and then sleep it until you get the warning from Aroma. It&#39;s pretty boring, but it&#39;s the only way to make sure nothing affects the monster.
