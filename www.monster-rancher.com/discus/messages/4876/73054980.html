 The formula for determining the baby&#39;s stats is 10% of the parents stats added to the baby&#39;s base stat rounded down.  For example, a Saga made from combining two monsters that have 999 on Power, Accuracy, and Speed with 500 on everything else will have it&#39;s base stats plus 199 on Power, Accuracy, and Speed, &#40;999&#43;999=1998, divided by ten is 199.8, rounded down is 199 over base.&#41;  And all of the stats that were 500 will add 50 each, for a total of 100 over base.  The resulting Saga would look like this: <BR> <BR>Naga/Zan: <BR>Pow: 999 <BR>Int: 500 <BR>Acc: 999 <BR>Spd: 999 <BR>Def: 500 <BR>Lif: 500 <BR> <BR>Saga: <BR>Base/Contributed/Total <BR>Pow: 160/199/359 <BR>Int: 90/100/190 <BR>Acc: 170/199/369 <BR>Spd: 170/199/369 <BR>Def: 90/100/190 <BR>Lif: 95/100/195 <BR> <BR>Hope you all find that useful.

I got it checked on, good job Automaton.  Tested it out myself... <BR> <BR>Now, Angolmer &#40;Golem/Joker&#41; has baseline stats of: <BR>170 <BR>95 <BR>75 <BR>65 <BR>150 <BR>110 <BR> <BR>Now, I had a raised Golem and a raised Joker with stats of... <BR> <BR>Golem:                Joker: <BR>999                   174 <BR>135                   976 <BR>406                   396 <BR>69                    253 <BR>337                   103 <BR>220                   205 <BR> <BR>Now, after trying this method 3 times, I found out with the <B>main</B> breed you round up, and the <B>secondary</B> breed rounded down.  Rounded with x.10 would be... <BR> <BR>100              17 <BR>14               97 <BR>41               39 <BR>7                25 <BR>34               10 <BR>22               20 <BR> <BR>Add the baseline to that additives... <BR> <BR>170 &#43; 100 &#43; 17 - 287 <BR>95 &#43; 14 &#43; 97   - 206 <BR>75 &#43; 41 &#43; 39   - 155 <BR>65 &#43; 7 &#43; 25    - 87 <BR>150 &#43; 34 &#43; 10  - 194 <BR>110 &#43; 22 &#43; 20  - 152 <BR> <BR>Sure enough, those were the stats got and tested out.  It may look a little too much, but it&#39;s fairly easy.  Last note would be, multiply 10% to their stats, round up to the main, round down for the secondary, then add those numbers from each breed to the baseline stats of whatever is the resulting breed.

 Thanks, Omni Strunks.  Thing is, if me and ANelson from GameFAQs hadn&#39;t devised a way to get 999 on every stat, and had I not tried to combine two such monsters, I wouldn&#39;t have found the formula.  The resulting Justin would have had the following stats at birth: <BR> <BR>334 <BR>279 <BR>309 <BR>289 <BR>344 <BR>299 <BR> <BR>And I noticed the spread on them was very similar to the baseline stats of the Justin.  After subtracting the base stats from those figures, the number 199 was the common figure for all six of them.  After running a few tests on some of my crappier monsters that had been raised the normal weak way, &#40;Mwa, haw!&#41; the same formula came up.  Oh, and rounding up the main and rounding down the sub gets you the same number ultimately as adding the two together and then rounding down. <BR> <BR>99.9&#43;17.4=117.3, rounded down is 117. <BR>100&#43;17=117. <BR> <BR>So, both methods work, but it&#39;s definitely easier to figure without a calculator if done your way.  Although, if both decimals added together don&#39;t amount to .5 or greater, I don&#39;t think it would be right to round either of the numbers up.  Let me try out some monsters with ones and twos in the ones digit on one of their stats and tell you how it turns out.  BRB. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;WOMAN FROM IPANEMA MUZAK&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Combining a ArmeDragon with 530 Accuracy used as the main, with a Diva with 402 Accuracy used as the sub has 208 Accuracy, minus 115 which is the base Accuracy for a dragon, is 93, which is 53&#43;40 &#40;rounded down&#41;, not with the Main rounded up and the sub rounded down.  Now I&#39;ll try two stats that equal a .5 decimal, to see if it goes up or down.  I&#39;m assuming it&#39;ll drop the decimal after adding. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;MORE WOMAN FROM IPANEMA MUZAK&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Saga, 762 power, with an Allure, 83 power. <BR> <BR>229 power, minus Syuri&#39;s base power of 145, is 84.  So it apparently adds the figures together, and then rounds down to the nearest whole number.  So the decimals are added together like I originally thought, then the resulting figure is cut off at the decimal point.
