 Okay, this is frustrating, complicated, annoying, and will likely cause you to tear out every last hair on your head, and you&#39;ll also likely devise new and interesting uses for all those old expletives you learned from your uncle when you were a fifth grader. <BR> <BR>This training method was devised by ANelson of GameFAQs, and confirmed by myself.  However, research being what it is, one of the original regs of the Metropolis will likely also have to test this out to make sure it&#39;s possible and valid.  It sounds unbelievable, I know, but bear with me. <BR> <BR>Alright, first things first.  This method will EVENTUALLY start getting you some monsters that have 999 in -every single stat-.  This isn&#39;t BS, it&#39;s real.  Tested and confirmed Seven times that I know of, by two different people.  This technique has been ironed out through hard experience, although it can still be improved upon.  So far the record for 999 in every stat is 2 years 5 months, although the speed at which your monster makes it to S rank is directly related to how fast you end up with 999 in every stat.  Keep in mind that this raising method taxes your monsters lifespan seriously, since it loses a week for every battle, and will likely fight in the mid double digits worth of battles before it hits 999 in every stat. <BR> <BR>YOU WILL NEED:  A good second gen monster, a monster that knows all the techs you want on your supermonster, at least 30,000 gold, and eventually you&#39;ll also need the Holy Cup, Bright Gem, and Aroma Pot, although you&#39;ll make enough money with your first couple freezer monsters to get them, regardless of whether or not said monsters actually have 999 in every stat. <BR> <BR>Now, to start, take your Second Gen monster, &#40;We&#39;ll call him Monster A, the stat monster&#41; and special train him until his Loyalty tops 30.  You&#39;ll want to focus on it&#39;s three most important stats, raising them evenly.  You&#39;ll want him to have 30&#43; loyalty before you freeze him, then promote him to C rank at the next official tourney, fight no other D rank battles except the official, as D rank battles suck for stat gains.  Once at C rank, freeze the monster until the next C rank tourney.  Let him rest when he&#39;s tired, and freeze him when he&#39;s not battling.  If you don&#39;t win the tourney, &#40;2nd place isn&#39;t an option:  If I wanted to increase my stats by 60 in one month I&#39;d use coaches.&#41; then turn off your GBA before you return back to the ranch after the tourney.  DO NOT TURN IT OFF WHILE IT&#39;S ACCESSING YOUR SAVE DATA.  And wait about five-ten seconds before turning it back on again.  If you&#39;re careful, you won&#39;t fry your data.  I&#39;m on year 82, and haven&#39;t had any problems with my save data thus far, so keep the above all-caps statement in mind at all times.  Oh, and sorry for yelling.  :/ <BR> <BR>Techwise, you&#39;ll want Gold Gift, Iron Heart, and lots of battle techs.  Big Eater may come in handy later, I&#39;ll get to that in a bit.  Once you start the actual battle/freeze process on a monster, the necessity for Gold Gift and Iron Heart is past, so you can delete them with the appropriate Lethe Rx items and put battle traits in their place.  Although, you&#39;ll want Gold Gift and Iron Heart both to remain on your second monster, to pass on to your supermonster-to-be. <BR>  <BR>  During the off weeks between tourneys, take your monster that knows the techs you want, &#40;we&#39;ll call him Monster B, see above.&#41; and do nothing but special training with him for his entire life cycle.  That&#39;s right, blow all that money you got from your first monster&#39;s fights on special training, increasing his four most important stats, &#40;ie, everything but your supermonster-to-be&#39;s unused attack stat, be it Int or Pow.  That stat will be increased later, although at birth you&#39;ll want to stick to what it&#39;s good at, definitely.&#41;. <BR> <BR>  Promote Monster A, &#40;the stat monster&#41; to rank B at about 50 loyalty, or when his most pertinent stats reach about 400&#43;, whichever seems the more secure.  It&#39;s not necessary at this time to pound away and get him to S rank as fast as possible, because it&#39;s infuriatingly difficult for a first-gen monster to reach 999 on every stat.  These first two monsters are for &#34;breeding&#34; pedigree, so just get a feel for the battle/freeze process for now. <BR> <BR>  Now, Monster B&#39;s stats should look pretty decent by the time it reaches the end of it&#39;s production cycle, as special training gives you a fair amount of cumulative life over the long term, and the rest of it&#39;s stats should hit about 600-700.  &#40;Probably higher if you&#39;re using a Diva that has item traits on it...  Due not only to it&#39;s amazing beginning stats but also it&#39;s longevity.  If you do use a Diva for this purpose, do NOT delete Gold Gift from your Stat monster.&#41; <BR> <BR>If Monster B gets old before Monster A, you&#39;ll want to start raising another dummy monster and use the Freeze/Battle technique to start promoting Monster B on the official tourneys that you&#39;re not planning on promoting Monster A with.  If you can get him to Crown class, and make some fast cash, I believe you&#39;ll have a better chance of your baby supermonster starting with three &#40;or more&#41; techs at birth. <BR> <BR>Monster A should hit A rank by about a year, and you may have to fight the Durahan invitational for a few years before you can take a lot of the other A rank tourneys.  No pressure at this point, just shoot for S rank by a year and a half, &#40;According to your monster&#39;s life, not real time :p&#41; but if you miss it, no big deal.  You&#39;re not pushing for 999 in every stat yet, just developing some cash and some good breeding stock. <BR> <BR>You should promote to S rank as soon as you have a better than 50% chance to beat the Official A tourney.  If you luck out and get massive amounts of your primary attack stat and Accuracy, during your A ranked fights, this will be a lot easier than it sounds, with a little luck.  Also, you should have a decent techlist &#40;If incomplete&#41; at this time from your earlier foray into special training, so that can definitely help.  &#40;My first all 999 monster got there with just Swing and Cut In Two.  God, I loved him.  Yet, I hated him too. :p&#41;  Once in S rank, fight the Joker Invite about four or five times to suck up those 60/20 or better stat increases, and once you have about a 600 average, you can start hitting the Official tourneys too.  At about a 700 average, start waiting to rest your monsters until the week before an invite date for the Great 4 tourneys, and start sucking up that phat 6400G per tourney.  Once on a full role, you&#39;ll be making 40,600G per year!  Hell, even if Monster A gets old while you&#39;re doing this, keep slogging along until you have accumulated 146,000 gold, buying the Aroma Pot, Holy Cup, and Bright Gem in order, to raise your monsters life expectancies.  If you want, make even more, as money is always a good thing.  Right now I have 999 wins, 35 losses, and 999999G winnings from doing this.  If I can do it in ten easy steps, you can too! /infomercial <BR> <BR>Now, when both monsters hit old age, and are both Crown ranked, &#40;Although just getting your trait monster to S rank is prolly good enough&#41; it&#39;s time to combine those badboys.  Monster A, the stat monster, will probably have two or three stats in the 800s, two in the 700s, and maybe one or two in the 600s.  That alone should tell you that 999 in every stat is more than possible with decent breeding.  Monster B probably has about 650-700 in four stats and about 75% that amount in Life, and should have Gold Gift, Iron Heart, and any other traits are worthy of passing on.  Which of the two monsters you use as the base and which you use as the sub is pretty much irrelevant, although the base should probably be the one of the two monsters that has the faster Guts regen, for obvious reasons.  Just a suggestion. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll want to take both back to the ranch and use LetheRX items to get rid of any traits that would cause your desired ones to drop off the traitlist.  Good traits to have include Gold Gift, Iron Heart, Act View, &#40;Which every monster should have&#41; one of the Sharps/Knows for attack, and possibly Spec Mods/Dusk Aura/Armor/Rock Skin etc if you&#39;re making a tank.  Once combined, you&#39;ll notice that your baby&#39;s starting stats will more than likely be better than Diva&#39;s in almost all respects.  And, by the time you&#39;ve beaten numerous Great 4 tourneys, &#40;6400G&#41; and official S tourneys, &#40;5000G&#41; and had numerous worthless Elec Paints/Monol Frags/etc given to you for sale, you should have enough money to buy that Aroma Pot, Holy Cup, and Bright Gem you&#39;ve had on your X-mas wishlist for the last, oh, 10 game years. :p  Now&#39;s the time to buy them, if you haven&#39;t already, because now&#39;s when you need the most longevity possible for your perfect monster.  You&#39;ll basically do with this baby what you did with Monster A, although now, because of how much better it&#39;s stats are, and depending on what it&#39;s inherited techs are, you can either do the Special Training thing until they get some decent techs and a stat boost, or launch directly into the Official D tourney, fight C tourneys until you hit 30 Loyalty, fight B tourneys until you hit 50, do the Durahan thing for a few years, and then start wailing on the Joker, &#40;Who by now is probably cringing at the sound of your name.&#41;.  This new superbaby should be able to hit S rank at a tender 9-12 months.  You might luck out as I did and enter prime just as you&#39;re completing the A ranked official tourney, but even if you don&#39;t that&#39;s okay as long as you approach Peak Prime in the S rank.  Why?  Because, as you&#39;re approaching peak, you&#39;ll see stat gains in your primarily increased stat going from 60, to 70, to the maximum of &#43;81 at full peak.  It&#39;s at this time that the Big Eater trait might come in handy.  If you complete a tourney, and it says, &#34;XXX Looks kinda sleepy&#34; try to feed it one or two Torles&#39; Waters or Nuts Oils, and then for a test, go into the Special training, and agree to train.  If your monster&#39;s stats drop at the beginning of the fight from fatigue, turn off your GBA, let it rest for ten seconds, turn it on, and let your monster rest.  If they don&#39;t, still turn off your GBA, wait ten, turn it back on, then feed your monster the one or two Waters or Oils and then freeze it, because it can go another round before needing to rest.  You&#39;ll probably not want to do this method if your monster doesn&#39;t like Torles&#39; Waters or Nuts Oils, just an observation. :&#41;  Ride out the &#43;81s, and by the time your monster is 2 years old, it should have about an 800 average across all it&#39;s stats, and you can start throwing the Dynast fight in amongst the Great 4s, Invites, and Official tourneys.  Here&#39;s the dates for the Great 4 and Dynast invites: <BR> <BR>3rd Week of February, Invite arrives for Great 4 tourney.  Rest week 2 after defeating Joker Invite.  Tourney is scheduled for 3rd Week of March. <BR> <BR>2nd Week of April, Invite arrives for Great 4 tourney.  Freeze after fighting Great 4 tourney at the 3rd week of March, then get your monster out of the freezer on the 1st week of April, and rest it.  Tourney is scheduled for 2nd Week of May. <BR> <BR>1st Week of June, Invite arrives for Emporer&#39;s Cup.  Freeze after fighting Great 4 tourney on the 2nd Week of May, and then get your monster out of the freezer on the 4th Week of May, and rest it.  Tourney is scheduled 1st week of July, although if you&#39;re tired after the Official Tourney on the 4th Week of June, skip it, unless you pass the Water/Oil test.  Otherwise, the Gold from the Official tourney is far more important than Dynast. <BR> <BR>2nd Week of September, Invite arrives for Great 4 tourney.  After Zan invite on the 3rd Week of August, wait until the 1st week of September before you get your monster out of Storage and rest it.  Tourney scheduled for 2nd week of October. <BR> <BR>Once your monster gets 999 on a couple stats and is really close on the rest, you might have to reset after battles if the wrong stats increase.  Another way to handle this, is to start special training to top off your stats, but beware that if you do this too early, you may drive your monster into decrepity before it&#39;s time and never be able to attain 999 in every stat.  If that happens, well in a word, sux2buXD. <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, you&#39;ll need another dummy monster, this one you can either Special train for it&#39;s entire life to combine with something else for your next supermonster, or you can train it with Coaches, or whatever.  But the rest of this raising method is pretty much up to experimentation.  I&#39;ve provided a walkthrough based on my own experience and that of ANelson from GameFAQs, which should be more than sufficient to get you all the way through your first monster that has an unprecedented 999 on every single stat.  However, what you do with the monster at that point is up to you.  I used mine for Heavy Drill coaches, since 999 in three stats is the best way to maximize their potential, and I can still use them for PvP battling, provided someone is stupid enough to challenge me in the first place.  Getting two monsters that have 999 in every stat and combining them to get a baby with 199 over racial base in every stat is okay if you&#39;re into that sort of thing, but I think it&#39;s kinda a waste since by design, such a baby can equal it&#39;s parents in a shorter time, but can never surpass them, so I can&#39;t honestly recommend it.  Although, when fooling around with such a combination, it did lead me to finding the stat carryover formula, so it wasn&#39;t a total waste. :p <BR> <BR>Enjoy!  Lisa Shock will probably want additional confirmation from one of the other researchers here, so go ahead and post any revisions you&#39;d like to add to this excellent raising method. <BR> <BR>In closing, I can&#39;t imagine a better way to raise many monsters simultaneously while amassing ridiculous wealth than using this method.  Although, you might want to use your off weeks raising some toned-down killers for PvP fights, as this method isn&#39;t common knowledge, and your friends would probably try to accuse you of using a cheat device if you take your God Monster up against their limp-wristed little War Rocks that has 999 Pow and Skill, and 300 on everything else.

 Okay, I did some recalculating, and under the &#34;YOU WILL NEED&#34; portion of the previous post, you&#39;ll probably want twice that amount of gold to start, although you can coach train a monster while you&#39;re Freezer Training your primary, to amass enough money to start special training your secondary.  Either way, the two monsters that go into your supermonster aren&#39;t inextricably linked until after they&#39;re geezers anyways, so the timing on raising them isn&#39;t critical, as long as you get them both into the freezer at Crown Rank at roughly the same time.

 Man, something I forgot to mention, is that special training for a monster&#39;s entire lifespan does -not- reduce it&#39;s lifespan like fighting does.  I guess the game considers it to be like a heavy-heavy drill.  So just as long as you don&#39;t let your monster get KOed by the teacher, &#40;Only really possible with speed training, since the Special Only monster will be in D rank until it&#39;s old anyways.&#41; and you don&#39;t let it exceed &#34;Seems Tired&#34;, then it should live actually longer than most monsters that are battle trained.  I had a Diva live to be 4 years 9 months for sure before it stopped gaining, maybe a little longer, with pure special training.  He ended up with 999 in Int, Acc, and Def, with well over 800 in Lif, and about 490 Speed.  &#40;Pow was still 255, as I was raising him for a combining component for an Int dragon.&#41;

I will do some testing on this soon. &#40;a few busy days ahead for me&#41; Overall it looks like it has a good chance of being worthwhile.  <BR> <BR><B>Note that messages posted here should directly relate to testing this method.  <BR>I am going to be really strict in deleting any off-topic posts that pop up here.</B>

 I am in the middle of testing this and about to combind my two divas.Even befor I read this I used a method like it but,some of your spesifications made this method perfect.

 Using special training exclusively on two divas can get each to about a 4600 composite by the time they stop gaining, and the resulting baby dragon after combining would have a 1675 composite, &#40;Dragon&#39;s base composite is 755, a mere 45% of the final baby&#39;s composite.&#41;  That&#39;s a pretty good starting point, and for the purposes of using this method, is a pretty quick way to confirm it.  My only question is, would there be a sound way for you to confirm the method?  Lisa herself will likely test it as soon as she has a little time on her hands, as she&#39;s also been testing lifespans and whatnot for MR3. <BR> <BR>Oh, and the Big Eater trait would probably work with Nitro Berries instead of the Torle&#39;s Waters and Nuts Oils.  Just remember to do the special trick during an off week to check to see if your stats get reduced from fatigue, as the week of a tourney is not the time to check your monster, for obvious reasons. <BR> <BR>Another recent finding, is that if your monster seems kinda sleepy, turning off your GBA and turning it back on again may set your monster back to pretty good, depending on how close to that fatigue level they are.  I believe that there&#39;s like a multiple point fatigue scale, and even though Aroma says your monster looks energetic, lively, good, sleepy, tired, worn out, exhausted, ready to drop, etc, there&#39;s intermediate steps between those.
