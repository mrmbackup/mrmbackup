 Okay, first off one thing I&#39;ve noticed and wonder if anyone can pipe in to support or whatever. It seems from what I&#39;ve played so far that the stray monsters showing up on your ranch may be linked to fame, since I&#39;ve had them show up at some low ranks, as long as my current monster has a decent bit of fame under its belt. Anyone else? <BR> <BR>Also, has anyone had an opponent monster withdraw from a match without fighting you? I rather liked when that happened in the regular console games, as it saved some time... but I&#39;m suspecting now that that may have been one of the things lost in the transfer to a portable game. <BR> <BR>Third, is anyone else noticing a trend starting up of some of the handheld games being more complex and more in the spirit of the previous games than the latest &#34;console&#34; versions? I&#39;ve noticed this now with this game and Monster Rancher 3, and also in Harvest Moon 3 for the GBC and Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland. In both of the PS2 games, the games got really drastically changed, perhaps in part to make them more accessible to younger gamers &#40;judging by some of the changes in each&#41;, whereas in both handheld games there are a lot of things that are &#34;more true&#34; to the previous games &#40;and IMHO more fun&#41; than in the current &#34;big name&#34; versions. Not that I&#39;m saying that MR3 or HM:STH aren&#39;t fun... just less fun than they could have been, with a lot of the complexity and better parts of the games gone. I&#39;d honestly rather have seen the drastic departures in the handheld games, as a sort of &#34;side thing,&#34; and the versions that ended up as the handhelds instead being fleshed out and made into the more meaty PS2 games. But maybe that&#39;s just me... <BR> <BR>Oh, and as one last note... is it just me, or is Bolzoi really cute?

 Please, I&#39;m already having bad premonitions about who Aroma wants to be more ladylike &#40;wife-material&#41; for. Not many choices but Bolzoi around.

 &#42;grins&#42; yeah, I just ran into that one a couple weeks ago... <BR> <BR>Well, there&#39;s also.. um... no, that&#39;s a girl. Well there&#39;s.. no... that&#39;s a girl too. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s always Crow...!  <BR> <BR>Or Mr.. ah.. whatever his name is. The one that&#39;s the &#34;head official&#34; guy, that told her she should be more ladylike in the first place. <BR> <BR>Or now that I think about it, I don&#39;t think you got to pick if you&#39;re a male or female trainer in this one... so maybe they&#39;re assuming male, and she&#39;s trying to be more ladylike for you/me.

 301 battles and no give ups....I think I can safely say there isn&#39;t any.  Some of those involved a monster of mine with a maxxed stat in C rank XD
