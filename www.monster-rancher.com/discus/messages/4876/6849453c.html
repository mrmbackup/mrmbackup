 I decided to work on a method for raising monsters in MRA, in hopes of getting one to max out. The experiment is in its early stages, and I need more tests &#40;Wish I knew what some of the item shop items really did!&#41; but, here&#39;s the basics: <BR> <BR>This is a freezer method, meaning you will need dummy monsters to use in the off weeks. <BR> <BR>It will be helpful to have the stress/fatigue reducing items held in inventory, as well as the sleep enhancing ones. The most expensive ones should give better results, and hopefully help avoid lifespan loss. Battle iteself probably shortens lifespan, but that&#39;s all part of this test; to see if the huge statgains after battle can max out a monster before the lifespan loss catches up with it. <BR> <BR>The monster you are really raising will need to get stats good enough to beat a D level tourney, so, either get a good monster by combination, or raise one for a bit until it can at least consistently place second in unofficial tourneys. Also, raising a little bit helps eliminate foolery. &#40;If there was an item that raises loyalty, I would recommend using it ASAP.&#41; <BR> <BR>Once your monster can make second in tourneys, start battling. Essentially, force it to battle in unofficial tourneys, then rest one week and freeze until the next battle. When it gets good enough, then go to the next level. If you can skip a week of rest because you didn&#39;t get a sleepy/tired warning be very careful to rest the week following the next tourney. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s pretty much it. Without more info on what items do, I can&#39;t really elaborate. There should at some point be items that might allow real reductions in the weeks of rest, but I can&#39;t really say anything about that now. <BR> <BR>I will be working on this for the next week or so. Any input would be appreciated.

 I had thought of a theory like this, I just wasn&#39;t brave enough to try it.  I&#39;ll be your guinea pig.

 I actually have two raised like this already. This info may make me feel good enough to consider applying for MR metropolise membership! Anyways, they&#39;re both at the end of their training life now... <BR> <BR>Here is number 1: <BR> <BR>Name: Astarte <BR>Age: 3 years, 9 months <BR>Race: Pixie/Joker <BR>Power: 125 <BR>Intelligence: 649 &#40;Drat, needed one more point!&#41; <BR>Accuracy: 771 <BR>Speed: 655 <BR>Defense: 317 <BR>Life: 304 <BR> <BR>Here is number 2: <BR> <BR>Name: Steel Crab <BR>Age: 4 years, 2 months <BR>Race: Arrowhead/Durahan <BR>Power: 535 <BR>Intelligence: 452 <BR>Accuracy: 413 <BR>Speed: 375 <BR>Defense: 651 <BR>Life: 631 <BR> <BR>I rested them every week immediately after a tourney so they&#39;d be in shape for the next one. The Aroma Pot came in handy for that. As you can see, their stats are great, but not terribly different from a monster raised normally. Astarte probably should have lived longer too. But I cannot deny that these two made me filthy rich and between them, they unlocked Joker and Zan for me. Another problem is that stats don&#39;t grow in the way you&#39;d shape them, in favor of evening out. This might be great for some monsters, such as Zuum or Joker. Not to mention you feel kinda one-stepped removed from the creature&#39;s development. One more note: If you consistently praise them for their efforts in a tourney, regardless of actual performance, their loyalty shoots straight up.
