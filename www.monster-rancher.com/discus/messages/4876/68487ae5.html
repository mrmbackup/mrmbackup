 That characteristic sounds so awesome.  Is there a monster that starts with it?  How do we know of its existence?

 A theory: since &#34;Dusk Aura&#34; can be gained by combining monsters with Light Aura and Dark Aura... perhaps combining two monsters with all of the &#34;Hi-...&#34; characteristics would work?  I haven&#39;t had a chance to try this for the last two days, but I was also intrigued when I saw this on the characteristics chart.  I&#39;m also interested in &#34;Spec Mods,&#34; which seems to offer resists to all element types.  &#34;Fairy Know,&#34; which boosts all element attacks, I think, is on one of the special monsters.  I&#39;m at work and can&#39;t test this stuff now, but I thought I&#39;d share my ideas... please don&#39;t get upset if I&#39;m wrong :&#41;

 Combining two monsters to have all the Hi-Traits combined will eliminate all of them and give Gold Gift. This is verified but takes some work.

 A lot of work, but if you can get the monster with gold gift to be in your book you&#39;re set with an awesome combiner.

 ALL of the Hi- traits or all of the ones that increase stat gains? <BR> <BR>I noticed one called Hi-resist and it doesn&#39;t seem to have anything to do with gold gift.

 Only the stat gains.. these would be: <BR> <BR>Hi-Power <BR>Hi-Tough <BR>Hi-Sense <BR>Hi-Speed <BR>Hi-Tech <BR> <BR>Hope it helps

 I&#39;ve been playing around with Gold Gift for a bit now and I believe I have successfully mastered the technique, AND I now have a Sub-Durahan that starts with Armor/Gold Gift//Dusk Aura..I use him to start combining first alwways. If possible, I want to submit a Gold Gift General FAQ to help out :&#41; By the way, I am &#39;Indigo&#39; from GameFAQs

 Well, you all should know how to get gold gift. It is pretty simple. When you get all the items that gives you the hi-traits, put it on your monster and you simply just get the gold gift as a single trait without wasting your other traits space.

 This makes me wonder if there is a skill that can be obtained that is made when combining all the &#39;Sharp Claw, Sharp Bld.etc&#39; skills into one &#39;More Damage with Every Attack&#39; skill. Just theory but worth a try..I will post back with my findings.

 if you combined all of the resists or knows, would you likewise get an ultimate resist or know technique?

 Ummm, I&#39;m having a problem. <BR> <BR>I have a Durahan with Hi-Tech and Hi-Resist, and a Tiger with Hi-Sence, Hi-Speed, Hi-Power, and Hi-Tough. But everytime I combine them I get a monster with Armor, Elec Resis, and 4 of the Hi characteristics. Anyone know if I&#39;m doing anything wrong?

 Most monsters have a native trait &#40;Durahan=Armor, Tiger=Elec Resis&#41;. People have reported that even if erased with the LetheRXs, these native traits will reappear in the combine.  <BR> <BR>In combining, your Main contributes the first trait on the new monster and your Sub the second and Native traits seem to have priority over others. Like so: Trait 1= Main 1, Trait 2= Sub 1 and so on.  <BR> <BR>So what&#39;s happening is that the Native traits are walking the last of the Hi-s off the board so that they don&#39;t combine to become Gold Gift &#40;6 trait max, remember&#41;. <BR> <BR>Offhand, I&#39;d say combine with a monster like Zan that doesn&#39;t seem to have a Native trait first. Erase whatever you don&#39;t need, like Elec Resis, then combine that into your Durahan. Also, be sure and eliminate anything from the Durahan that you don&#39;t need like Hi-Resist. You must keep it under the six trait limit for Gold Gift to show up. And for a Durahan, Armor will always show up. <BR> <BR>Once you have Gold Gift, you can use it to combine into anything you want, so long as it is high enough in the trait list to transfer.

 It&#39;s still a guessing game for some traits. Also, it would help to know which monsters you were combining as some monsters can&#39;t inherit some traits. And we still don&#39;t know all the combos possible. More data please.

 Hooray!  I got a Roadroller with: <BR> <BR>Gold Gift <BR>Fairy Know <BR>Iron Heart <BR>Dusk Aura <BR> <BR>If one combination doesn&#39;t work, try the opposite way.  For example, during one combination in the process where I was combining two monsters, I got Earth Know, Elec-Proof and 4 of the Hi-Traits on a Ducken/Psiroller &#40;I think&#41;.  However, when I went the other way and got a Psiroller/Ducken, I got Gold Gift and Earth Know.  If you combine A then B and it doesn&#39;t work, combine B then A.
