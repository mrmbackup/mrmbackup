 Ok.  1:  Why hasn&#39;t anyone talked about this?  2:  Is it all that important?  For example, I had a Dogmar that Liked Sleeping, and Disliked Ace&#40;My name&#41;.  If it Dislikes me, does it really matter?  All I noticed was a slight increase in power, but  slight decrease in defense , and a liitle more stress.  I chalked it up to taking its rage out in the battle.  I had a Sp. Lesione &#40;not Irassie, can&#39;t remember its name&#41; who Liked Playing and Disliked Battle.  How do you Play?  I think that the Dislike of battle means it gets more stress or less defense.  Could someone just answer my question?

 don&#39;t think it matters at all, maybe just a bit.  I had one&#40;Diamante&#41; that liked playing, disliked battle, too. It worked just fine in battle, wasn&#39;t stressed, good stats, etc. Got to A class, but then I decided to use a different monster instead. <BR>Also, my Nut Arrow which liked battle, disliked playing, ended up the same.  Not higher defence/less stress or anything.

 In other MR games, the like/dislikes affected stress &amp; fatigue generated by actives, and reduced by food. Liked foods, for example, reduced more stress &amp; fatigue than if the exact same food was disliked. If battles were disliked, more fatigue would develop, if liked, less fatigue was the result. It&#39;s usually not a huge difference, but a rancher may need to be aware of the preferences, and expect to slightly alter their raising method accordingly.

 Thanks for your help, but no one addressed my OTHER question.  How do you PLAY with your monsters?  Is that training?  Or is that something differant, nonexistant or hidden?  I&#39;d really like to know.

 Does not appear to exist in this game, there were min-games in MR2 where you could. Essentially, it meant that if a monster got to being spoiled, they would want to waste weeks playing instead of drilling. If you gave in you lost valuable weeks of statgains just to play. Now, I think it means they will get spoiled faster, and tend to fail more on drills they aren&#39;t good at.

 My monster which liked playing/disliked battles did just fine in drills, and succeeded all the time, so I&#39;m not sure about that.  I think that playing just isn&#39;t in the game, and it just tells you that you have a playful monster for pretty much no reason
