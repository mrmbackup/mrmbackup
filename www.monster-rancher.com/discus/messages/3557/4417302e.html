 Sry for taking so long I&#39;ve been fairly busy.  But here is Chapter 9.  Enjoy! <BR> <BR>Chapter 9: Metal Claws <BR> <BR>	Wes and the group had been traveling for another week.  They had been hanging on using the forest’s plants for food.  They had not seen any sign of civilization since Dark Wood &#40;not counting the destroyed Zuum town&#41;.  Rancher guessed the Zuum’s were hostile toward Abbadon.   <BR> <BR>	Rancher remembered pushing the longsword into the man’s abdomen and being able to feel the warm blood run down his hands.  Then he remembered the cold feeling when he learned that Dragon used the Weapon technology to create Abbadon into one.  The most powerful one.  He’s stronger then Draco.  Rancher recalled the words that he remembered Abbadon saying before he was impaled… <BR> <BR>“Humans have mislead themselves to believe that they are a superior breed.  When it is these creatures, that you have labeled monsters, that are superior.  You and all of your enslaving kind will perish!  I can die now knowing that my goals are complete.  Now that the Weapons have been unleashed, Mankind will now feel the pain that the monsters have felt.  This is the end of the enslaving of monsters!  This is the end of the weak and the rising of the strong!  This is the end of Man’s ignorance!  This, this is the end of Mankind!” <BR> <BR>Rancher and the group finally arrived at the desert border.  They set in toward the small inn that resided in the middle of a small beat up village.  Wes went out to grab some food and left Rancher, Killa Kan and King in the room alone. <BR> <BR>“Another two weeks and we’ll be back at Midnight Village,” Rancher said. <BR>“Don’t you think that this is suicidal?” questioned King, showing great concern and fear. <BR>“We do this or we can keep running our whole lives till they get us,” Rancher casually replied. <BR>“What about the other Weapons,” Killa Kan began, “I mean how are we suppose to defeat them?”  <BR> Rancher hung his head in worry.  “I don’t know.  Our only chance to beat them, is you.  But even then, you being a prototype and the others being the real thing.  As far as I know they might be invincible.  What makes the Weapons so awesome, is the fact that they can withstand so much damage and then they themselves are capable of wiping out whole cities.  Just as I’ve said before, this mission will seal our fates.  We are hopeless.” <BR> <BR>At the outskirts of town, a tall man stood on a mesa overlooking the town.  His brown cloak flapped vividly in the dry desert wind.  The tall neck of his pullover stood up just to the top of his nose.  His worn wide-brimmed hat sat down right above his dull blue eyes.   <BR> <BR>“Your target is Geete and Rancher.  Go in there, kill them, then return.  Do not screw around, Abbadon says he wants them dead and fast.  You got that Hagar?”  the man spoke, his tone as stern and set as the mesa.  <BR> <BR>Behind his stood a large metal Arrowhead.  It looked exactly like a Renocraft, yet slightly more sophisticated in design.  It’s eyes turned to sinister red slits as it listened to the cloaked man brief him.  Then after a simple gesture of understanding it leapt off the mesa and landed a slight distance from the town, unfazed and undamaged from the incredible drop. <BR> <BR>Inside the inn the group enjoyed a large meal.  Killa Kan suddenly stopped in the middle of sipping some tea and a look of sheer terror overtook his face.  Rancher noticed him first then fear hastily ran though him as he realized what this might mean.   <BR> <BR>“Killa Kan, you okay?  Is it…” Rancher stopped trying to cope with his shock.  Then King and Wes looked over in worry.  Wes not knowing what’s going on, but King got the idea. <BR> <BR>“It’s Hagar,” Killa Kan said with a shaky voice, “he’s right outside.”  <BR> <BR>Almost in response a pulsating sound began from outside. <BR> <BR>“Get down!” Rancher yelled, pulling Wes to the ground.  Just as Wes hit the floor a loud explosion erupted one of the walls, sending debris raining all over the room.  The group stood and readied themselves.  The smoke cleared to reveal the Renocraft type creature standing where the wall used to be.   <BR> <BR>One of his claws opened and from between the two parts, a blue light began to glow, and the pulsating sound began again.  Killa Kan swung out his gattlings, which sounded a loud clack as they locked into place.  Right as he leveled his aim he opened fire, unleashing a great hail of bullets.  But the projectiles meet a blue force field similar to the one Killa Kan used back in Dark Wood, the bullets fell harmlessly to the ground. <BR> <BR>Hagar produced a sound, which might have been laughter, but it sounded like quick, short breaths.  Then he pointed his charged claw at the group and a white blaze spouted out.  All of the group dived to the sides as the hot beam blazed into the wall behind them, which resulted in a few screams of the people that were in that room.  <BR> <BR>Killa Kan uprighted himself and charged at Hagar.  He flipped his right gattling into the cannon and his left gattling into his normal hand.  Hagar opened both of his claws and readied to meet the charge.   <BR> <BR>“Get out of here!” Killa Kan yelled as he thrust his left hand at the metal arrowhead.  Rancher helped Wes up and then headed out of the place &#40;or what was still standing of it&#41;.   <BR> <BR>Hagar meet Killa Kan’s strike with his right claw then lifted his left claw and began charging it for another blast.  Killa Kan lifted his right arm and began charging that.  The two Weapons stood there facing each others charged armaments.   <BR> <BR>Hagar was the first to fire.  Killa Kan was fast enough to react and bring his left arm and push Hagar’s firing arm up, punching a large hole in the roof.  Killa Kan then quickly brought up his firing arm and a hot white blast enveloped Hagar.   <BR> <BR>After the loud blast, the place fell into a deep silence.  A large cloud of dust obscured Killa Kan’s vision.  Then, in a sudden and swift movement, the large metal Arrow Head pinned Killa Kan to the ground with one of his large claws.  Blue energy quickly began to build from the claw and filled Killa Kan’s sight.  He knew that such a large blast from point-blank would do him in, but if he could pull this off, he’ll be able to take Hagar out with him.   <BR> <BR>Rancher, Wes, and King were watching the fight from a safe distance.  Rancher was very concerned now seeing that Hagar was ready to blow Killa Kan into the center of the earth.  Then he spotted Killa Kan charging up his cannon, and Hagar doesn’t notice it.  But Hagar is already charged.  What’s Killa Kan doing? <BR> <BR>Hagar unleashed his blast, but as he did Killa Kan lifted his cannon under Hagar’s belly and fired.  A large dome of white energy took up half the remaining part of the building.  It stood still gleaming as bright as the sun, then it slowly faded leaving a cloud of dust settling over the area.  Rancher, Wes, King and several observers stood in silence.   <BR> <BR>Killa Kan had fired just as Hagar fired.  But who survived?  Rancher knew that Killa Kan was supposedly the weakest of the Weapons, but he has shown that he is much more then meets the eye.   <BR> <BR>“Rancher?” Wes spoke, “do you think… Killa Kan is… dead?” <BR>	“Dunno Wes,” Rancher replied sounding as if he just lost a good friend, which he very well may have. <BR> <BR>Out on the same mesa, stood the cloaked man.  He watched as the bright dome of light faded.  Then a smile cracked on his face, hidden from the tall neck of his pullover.  Then he broke out in a wild laughter that rang out though the area. <BR> <BR>-Nicholas D. Wolfwood-

 Hmmm...didn&#39;t notice it &#39;till now, but you must be a Final Fantasy 7 fan. Nice addition. Nothing like gigantic, robotic beasts battleing in mortal combat to sooth a story, eh?

 Well Killa Kan actually the name of friends Gobi...but yes he did name it after the Ork unit.  And Abbadon is suppose to be the anti-christ in the Bible &#40;i think&#41;.  So yes Killa Kan is a 40K name. but Abbadon isn&#39;t.  And ye sI do see what you mean Torey, about FF7 with the Weapons.  But the thing is just wait and you&#39;ll figure out more of how non-FF7 the Weapons are. <BR> <BR>Well plenty is already apparant anyways.  1- so far they are all machine like.  2- there not 20 stories and 3- they don&#39;t have &#43;100,000 H.P..
