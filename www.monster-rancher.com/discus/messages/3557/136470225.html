 Screams of mosters and man were heard as the Raiden waited nervously. <BR>&#34;Can I beat him?How strong is he,or is he good in INT?Am I ready for this?&#34;all these things raced in his mind as a man ,no older than 18,called his name. <BR>It was his master,Chris. <BR>&#34;Judo!&#34;Chris exlaimed.&#34;It&#39;s time!&#34; <BR>&#34;Huh?&#34;The Raiden asked. <BR>&#34;Get out there,Judo!&#34;Chris told him as pushing him outside. <BR>    The sun glazed down on him as he slowly stepped onto the ring to finally meet his opponent. <BR>   He laughed at the sight of his enemy.It was a Cute little Eared Mew&#40;Mew/Hare&#41;.It was just sitting there licking it&#39;s tail . <BR>   &#34;You&#39;re my opponent?&#34;Judo laughed.&#34;Heh&#34; <BR>   The Mew said nothing. <BR>   &#34;You can&#39;t talk,how sad.Hahahah!&#34;Judo mocked. <BR>   The Mew still continue to lick. <BR>   &#34;Ready...Fight!&#34;The anouncer yelled. <BR>   It then pounced on Judo.As the claws dug deeper,he heard Chris yelling at him.He found the strength to finally pull it off him.Judo then pounced in the air,and plow kicked it. <BR>   As the Mew tried to get up,gunfire was heard. <BR>The Mew had been shot.The stadium became silent as the Mew Fell to the ground... <BR>   This was the begining of Judo&#39;s Quest to learn not to take forgrantted his most precious item,his life.

This story was pretty short, but cool. You should write the next one <B>much</B> longer. I mean way longer. You had me into it when it ended. One more thing, could you go to the epics in progress III, and read my stories. They are titled &#34;The Rangers of Lot&#34;. Nobody has seen these, and I want someone to read these to get a second opinion.

I seriously suggest you learn to read the site guidelines before posting anything else. <BR> <BR>The main page for this section says: <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>This section is exclusively for the continuing stories in the Reign of the Master, MR World, The Story of Leo, The Line, A Warrior&#39;s Trek, The Wind Doesn&#39;t Cry, and Youth series.  <BR>Only the authors of those series may post here, in order to complete their epics.  <BR>If you want to start a new series, please go to the most recent Epics In Progress section.  <BR>&#40;Right now that would be Epics In Progress, Section III&#41;</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>This message is intended for everyone, no one is exempt from it. Keep it up and you will be banned. First and final warning.
