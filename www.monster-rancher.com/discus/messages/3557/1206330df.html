 Sean faithfully followed the Gali. The Gali was talking about his brother, who was a General of Caesar and talking about his death. They were walking towards the area that he lived. The Gali then spoke.  <BR> <BR>“My brother, Darthgali is a General of Caesar. He believed what he was doing is right. Darthgali is a mighty force and has power that rivals my own strength. He was born a wild monster, abandoned, as I was. He is filled with hatred and rage which propels him against many humans. He happens to live on this Continent. The West Continent is under horrible control, free human percentage there is zero. We will try to free this side first. My brother is the main guy here. His followers aren’t what worry me though. We will have to be on our toes and be ready for anything. “  <BR> <BR>Sean and Gali walked further and saw another village. This time the attack was noticeable. People were shredded and flung through building as bodies were scattered everywhere and buildings collapsed. They both search for survivors, Sean most possible found the most gruesome seen.  <BR> <BR>It was an old man and in his blood it spelt.  <BR> <BR>“Gali will die.”  <BR> <BR>Then it became obvious that Darthgali had attacked this area. People were neatly rearranged into words like ‘death’, ‘kill’ and ‘murder’. This general seemed to be obsessed with death and killing. Sean’s young and developing stomach couldn’t take all this gore and violence and bent over and vomited. Gali used some type of psychic power and picked up bodies and moved them around and with a Napalm he burnt them and scattered the ashes in the forest. He knew there would be no survivors after his brother’s attack. They left, Gali spoke up and said.  <BR> <BR>“Don’t worry about losing your stomach after that. It’s a grotesque scene for anyone to bear. Darthgali was there, he made those signs with that mans limbs and blood. They were killed not long ago. They aren’t far away.”  <BR> <BR>They walked further and stopped at a spring and Sean began to drink some water as they relaxed. 3 rippers secretly watched them from the safety of a bush. Gali knew they were there, he could sense presence. He shot beams of Lightning at the bush and the Rippers scattered. Sean told Sean to stay near and that these Rippers were not weak.  <BR> <BR>One charged at Gali quite fast and was battered away by his arm. 2 attacked from behind and were easily countered and smashed. They all got up and attacked again they ran towards Gali as he shot out a great Napalm. The Rippers were all caught by surprise and were launched backwards. 1 Ripper didn’t make it. His skin slowly peeled off his body as he screamed in agony while his bones showed. The other Rippers pounced on Gali and clawed at him. They were swatted arm with one fell and didn’t get up fast enough as Gali quickly hovered towards him and raised his hand above him as it tripled in size and came down on the poor Rippers with the force of a 3 tons. It was a horrific attack with gruesome results. The other Ripper back down a bit and was electrocuted by a lightning bolt. Gali walked closer to the Ripper and grabbed him by his neck and picked him up and asked him who sent him. The Ripper uttered. “Darthgali.” Gali rung his neck and threw him to the side.  <BR> <BR>“If we do not kill the vermin now they will come after us, stronger. That’s why I had to kill them.” Gali said almost apologizing for the death of the Rippers. Sean washed up a bit and asked Gali.  <BR> <BR>“Why didn’t they attack me?”  <BR> <BR>“They want me dead. This is the East Continent. They don’t care about you. If I get killed somehow. You soon will join me.”  <BR> <BR>Sean became instantly quiet and continued to walk with Gali. They came across a small village, they walked in and no damage had been done to. Gali told Sean about this village before hand. Sean was trying to thinking about what it was when a Hare curiously hopped out. He saw Gali and rushed towards him.  <BR> <BR>“Gali!!” The Hare yelled as it ran towards the divine monster.  <BR> <BR>“This is a village of rebels, they will help us.”  Gali explained to Sean. <BR> <BR>“So, do you have the troops you want to take, Pulscorn? “ Gali asked curiously.  <BR> <BR>“Yes, I think we are ready.”  <BR> <BR>“Good, Sean stay here with these guys.”  <BR> <BR>Sean did as he said and waited for them in one of the straw built houses. A large Poseidon sat with Sean. The size of the Golem made him at ease.  <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, Gali led a team of the rebels. They were all elite in their own aspects, but their owners were murdered and they were wanted to get their revenge on the horrible monsters that committed that horrible crime.  <BR> <BR>Gali knew where he, it was brotherly instincts he went the way his gut showed him. He then sensed a few scouts roaming, they were Madillos. They were of great power and seemed to be stalking Gali. Gali then commanded that they come out and they did. They all rolled out of the bushes and stood up. The Pulscorn was the first to attack. There were 2 of them and the Pulscorn attack and missed. They then rolled up into a ball and slammed Pulscorn who attacked. Pulscorn survived it, but was horrible injured. Gali could sense that his ribs and arms were completely broken. Gali stepped up to the Madillos and stretched out his arms and went for a blow, they were dodged. For big creatures they had great speed and body control. They hopped on Gali’s arms and rolled at him. He then let control of his arms go as they faded away and the Madillos smashed into the ground. They curled back up into balls and rolled at Gali, they shredded the ground as Gali clenched his hands and raised them above his head and smashed one into the ground. The other was stopped by another one of the rebels, a Golem.  <BR> <BR>“Glad to see you help.” Gali joked.  <BR> <BR>The Golem held the Madillo in his hands and tried to smash him, but his armor was too strong to break. He threw the Madillo as hard as he could in the air and the Madillo soon caught control of his body and came down fast at the Golem. It was a direct connection and dirt and gravel flung everywhere. Gali knew that gravel proved Golem death as the other Madillo was still recovering. Gali placed his hand over the hole in which the Madillo was recovering. Napalm came out of his hand and the screams of agony stopped shortly. That Madillo was death and everyone knew it. Even the other one, Gali could feel his anger swell as he stood from the debris of the Golem. Gali aimed his hand at the Madillo and shot a streak of Lightning. It had no effect as it went through his body. The Madillo ran at Gali angrily and went for a punch. Gali caught it and sent more beams of lightning out as he held his hand trying to stop the blow. That attack wasn’t working he commanded someone to help, but they seemed all weak and ill- trained. An Aloha Saurian attack the Madillo from the side with his tail. It had no effect, Gali and Madillo were strong in a lock and neither was giving up anything. Gali then whispered, “I’m sorry.” As he unleashed the strongest attack he had. He sent pushed Madillo back a bit and with his right arm he forced it forward and a large angelic figure appeared from his hand. The angelic figure ripped through Madillo and instantly all that was left was a skeleton. It soon dissolved soon.  <BR> <BR>“Spirit Punch.” Gali muttered.

 GG, I say this once with as much seriousness as I possibly can: <BR> <BR>Proofread. <BR> <BR>I mean this in the plural. Your chapters aren’t long enough for proofreading twice, even three times, to be considered a hassle. It will knock out most of the errors. <BR> <BR>Seriously, proofread more. Your story is coming together nicely, but kind of hard for me to follow or get into, since I&#39;m constantly stumbling on the errors within it. I&#39;ll proofread your work if necessary or you lack the time. This chapter would take a whole ten minutes at most to clean up ALL the mistakes and typos. <BR> <BR>If the next chapter is this sloppy, I&#39;m forwarding you chain letters in reprisal. <BR> <BR>Lots of them.
