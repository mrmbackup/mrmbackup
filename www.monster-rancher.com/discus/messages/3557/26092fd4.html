 Galin and Roketh eyed their surrondings with great perception. Neither of them actually intended to be caught off gaurd here. They had fought each other, and they knew they were strong. Together, they had overcome Kingston himself, surely they could take out the last of his minions. <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t hear it anymore,&#34; Galin said as his head turned slightly, his eyes darting about the hidden paradise, &#34;I know something is here.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Too true. I feel a presence here. No, I sense two here.&#34; Roketh looked about as he turned slowly, &#34;They are watching us.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;CRUSH!&#34; A load voice thundered. <BR> <BR>Galin turned to see a spear comeing at blinding speed towards them. Galin pushed Roketh and ducked back, the spear flying mere inches past his chest. He landed on his back, Roketh on his stomache. They each looked up a Chariot larger than any they had seen ran between them. He grabbed his spear and plucked it from the ground like a vegetable. As he turned and prepared for another go, another voice rang forth. <BR> <BR>&#34;WAR! Calm yourself.&#34; <BR> <BR>As Galin and Roketh stood, they looked into a wooded section of Kingston&#39;s study and saw a pair of red eyes emiting from the darkness. A Terror Hound stepped out of the darkness, slightly shaking his head, &#34;Control your temper, foolish Centaur.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Chariot slowly lowered his head saying, &#34;Ummm...durrr....sawwy.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Tiger type casually walked between the twin, towering dragons to the side of the Centaur/Durahan, &#34;It is alright War.&#34; <BR> <BR>The dragons were mystified. The Tiger/Monol didn&#39;t make that noise. The Chariot was as big as each dragon, but he did not make the very ground shake. <BR> <BR>&#34;Is there others here?&#34; Roketh asked the Terror Hound. <BR> <BR>&#34;Make more noise and it will be I who naw your bones, not Chak&#39;el.&#34; The beast staring at them coldly, &#34;I am Moonshadow. State your business.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Durrr...yup. Chak&#39;el munch yous twos ups realllly goods yuper.&#34; War said pointing his spear tauntingly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Silence War. They came here for a purpose. One which I would like to know.&#34; <BR> <BR>The two dragons breifly explained the situation to the duo. The rumbling had stopped, but for how long none could say. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, you say that you two twits beat master Kingston? To top off that blasphemous boast, you say that a power greater than Kingston&#39;s  assimalated him, Dragonaught, and Nightmare after you had slain them all?&#34; Moonshadow asked a bit sarcastically. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes. That is the story. Now, what do you know of Kronock?&#34; Galin asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ohh yes. Master Kingston spoke of him highly. I assumed it was one of his underlings. Such as you Galin. He did speak highly of you as well, traitor.&#34; The Terror Hound said angrily. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ohhhhhhh....yous pissed offs the big dog nows. Yous twos should gos befores he is realllly pissed offs, yuppers.&#34; War said, once again showing off his shallow gene pool. <BR> <BR>WHOOM! The ground shoke once more. WHOOM! The sounds of large footsteps echoed and shoke the ground with each devastating stomp. <BR> <BR>&#34;No, Chak&#39;el has awoken. You two should flee. Come War, to the den.&#34; Moonshadow said as he headed back towards the wooded area. War began to do the same. <BR> <BR>Then, the trees parted and a giant golem stepped out. Not your average Golem, if it worked for Kingston, it was in some way special. It was a bit taller than either dragon. Off each shoulder, a large, metalic spike shot skyward. On each knuckle, a small, black spike also resided. His eyes glew fiery red. Two, mighty horns protruded from each side of his mammoth skull, going up slightly then bending forwards. Much like a bull. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Chak&#39;el. The intruders must be destroied. Moonshadow, I finally have you. Your den destroied you have no place to hide. I see you have friends now. War I know, the others are unknown to me. none the less, you all must perish for defiling my grounds.&#34; The golem spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;We will flee from you no longer.&#34; Moonshadow took a fighting pose. He turned to the dragons and said, &#34;Free us from this terror, and we shall join you.&#34; <BR> <BR>What choice did they have? He was going to attack them all anyway. The four took up a fighting pose and waited for the monster to make the first move. <BR> <BR>&#34;AHA! Finally, some action. Training most of my life does get old. After you train day in and day out for 27 years, you&#39;d be tired, too.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;....he say 27 years?&#34; Galin said shocked. <BR> <BR>&#34;His sub is rare, unknown to any save Kingston and possibly this Kronock charactor. He will live ages.&#34; Moonshadow said, never taking his gaze from Chak&#39;el. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hes won&#39;ts lives that long if I cans helps it!&#34; War said as he shot towards the titanic beast. <BR> <BR>Chak&#39;el raised his hand and attempted to crush him like a fly, but War was very nimble. A large handprint was imbedded into the ground from the force. War raised his spear high into the air and brought it down on the goliath&#39;s exposed shoulder. A loud WANG rang out from War&#39;s hollow body. He hit true, but all it did was vibrate through the spear and into him. Chak&#39;el backhanded him into the woods. <BR> <BR>The sounds of metel banging as war rolled through the woods enraged Moonshadow, &#34;Our fued ends here, Chak&#39;el!&#34; <BR> <BR>Moonshadow dove at the behemoth. Chak&#39;el punched strait forward. Anyone that has fought or raised a Tiger should know they are notorious for their speed and agility, Moonshadow was no exception. The Tiger bounced up slightly and ran down the monster&#39;s arm. Chak&#39;el only saw a black blur fly up his arm and hit him between the eyes. At this point, Moonshadow bolted into the air. Chak&#39;el&#39;s hands came to his face, a little more shocked than hurt from the previous attack. As he looked up, he saw nothing but lightning raining down. Dust flew up as it ripped into the ground around Chak&#39;el. <BR> <BR>Moonshadow landed a few feet away from the flying dirt, sure of his victoy. Then, a giant hand flew from the dust cloud. Moonshadow was struck broadsided and sent flying. His nimblness allowed him to land on his feet. He watched as the dirt disappated and the golem stood there mockingly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Thats all I needed to see. You can&#39;t defeat me.&#34; <BR> <BR>Chak&#39;ell found himself flying the next minute. He landed on his back and slid a small ways, leaving a large trail in his wake. As he stood, two dragons watched him intently. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hmmmmm.....double team huh? Well, two can play at that game.&#34; Chak&#39;el said as he stood. <BR> <BR>He got into a comfortable stance, and closed his eyes. His fist began shaking slightly, then his whole body. He began laughing, a small chuckle at first, then a loud, taunting laugh. <BR> <BR>&#34;Master of Puppets!&#34; Of he cried. As he did, his body fell into a puddle. Out of this puddle, a hand rose. Then another, and another, and another. <BR>Smaller versions of Chak&#39;el poured from the puddle. More than merely his body mass, at least 20 stood before them, each the same size as the dragons. The worst part was the puddle remained, Chak&#39;el&#39;s wicked face in the middle of it. <BR> <BR>&#34;Go my children. Make them....suffer.&#34; Chak&#39;el commanded with a slight cackel. <BR> <BR>Two fist sped at Roketh wildly. He dodged them, and the two puppets who threw them contined to do so. They were all over him, only these two. He ducked a right hook from one and saw a chance to attack. Of course he did, taking a huge chucnk of meat from one&#39;s gut. The other spun and kicked. Roketh caught it, spun, and threw him into two others. He glanced about, and saw Galin fighting off three. War was back, dented but back. He was charging through them all. Hacking and slashing as he went. <BR> <BR>Moonshadow was in the heap of it all. Roketh could tell where he was from the lightning and ice that occasionally shot up from the sea of minature monstrosities. Then, he felt a sharp pain in his back. One of the little terrors had kneed him in the small of his back. Roketh answered this call, of course. He piveted of his right leg and spun, swinging his fist with all the force he could muster. When his fist connected, the creature didn&#39;t even move from his spot. Instead, Roketh swung so hard he knocked a chunk from the monster&#39;s mid-section out of his back. Roketh thought he killed another one, then the flesh returned. It incased Roketh&#39;s wrist inside the beat, who began pounding on Roketh&#39;s head. Roketh picked him up over his head in an attempt to free his hand. He strained as hard as he could and, finally, ripped the fiend in half. His hand was free, yes, but he was stunned to see the pieces reconnect into one form again. He desperatly searched for the one whom he had gutted. To no avail, his wound had also healed. He was impossible to spot now. Roketh was even more frightened when he saw the puddle spitting out MORE of them. <BR> <BR>&#34;They won&#39;t die!&#34; Galin screamed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Galin! Do some sort of aerial flame attack.&#34; Roketh screamed as he bounded into the air, Galin doing the same. <BR> <BR>They unleashed a barrage of fireballs and streams. Demon Flare rained down from Roketh and Galin began shooting his Aura Balls from each of his four fists, each exploded with deadly impact. <BR> <BR>Galin landed and, enraged, used his trademark move. <BR> <BR>&#34;Thermal Claw!&#34; Each of his wrists spouted laser-like blades. He began cutting through them like butter. Heat was the key. Once the wounds were melted shut, the mud-men couldn&#39;t regrow them, nor reconnect them. <BR> <BR>Moonshadow jumped back towards Galin and Roketh. <BR> <BR>&#34;Where is War?&#34; Moonshaow asked. <BR> <BR>Chak&#39;el answered, &#34;Look at my minions fool.&#34; <BR> <BR>As they looked, they could see trace elements of metel in each of the mud-men. They had torn him apart then, absorbed him. Moonshadow had never known fury such as he felt now. He never knew hatred as he did now. Galin and Roketh stepped back as the Tiger growled angrily. The drones stepped closer none the less, for they did not know fear as their master did. He reformed from his puddle, behind his army of clones. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now what fool? you ready to die like War?&#34; Chak&#39;el asked simply with an evil grin. <BR> <BR>The tatoos on Moonshadow began to glow. The acient text of his ancestors seemed to be filling his body. The Tiger&#39;s balck texture glissened and became golden. A howl of rage rang and the now golden Tiger shot into the air. <BR> <BR>&#34;Moon Razor!&#34; As these words leaped from his maw, he darted down on them with a holy vengence. the clay figures were seen being slashed to pieces all at once. Shreds flying into the air as the hound moved with unbrideled speed. All the mud-men had fallen. Chak&#39;el stood alone speechless. Moonshadow appeared by them once more, staring at the silent fiend. <BR> <BR>&#34;It is done. Now I shall go with you.&#34; Moonshadow said as his golden coat fell back into its blackened texture. <BR> <BR>Then, Chak&#39;el&#39;s right arm fell off, followed shortly by a section of his chest. Very small pieces fell of, one at a time. His horns fell in small discs, and his head fell in two, evenly cut pieces. His whole body crumbled in some horrid perfection. Moonshadows vendetta was finally, over. <BR> <BR>&#40;A new ally has joined the ranks. Are other powerful monsters to join along the lines? We shall see.&#41;
