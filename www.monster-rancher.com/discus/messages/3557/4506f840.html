 Dadge stumbled back several feet. He glanced at his breastplate, which now had a rather large, square dent in the front of it. He brought himself upright as he looked at Kronock. The giant hammer slid back into Kronock&#39;s arm, reforming a hand. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fools. I am immortal.&#34; Kronock spoke slowly, &#34;You see, I am an amalgam of everything the Vile Lords were, and now still are, as part of me.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Is that why your practically a mix and match weapon?&#34; Moonshadow asked as he stepped beside Dadge, Galin also appearing. <BR> <BR>Kronock grinned, then chuckled. With each rise and fall of his disfigured shoulders he spoke, &#34;You can never win, and never understand my purpose.&#34; <BR> <BR>All of a sudden, Kronock outstretched his right arm, towards the ground. He shot three flesh balls into the ground. They landed with a wet plop. Then, they seemed to chuckle themselves as Kronock was doing, as they buried themselves into the ground. Silence followed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Some kind of mine?&#34; Galin asked, ready for combat. <BR> <BR>&#34;Heh, you wish I was so merciful…&#34; Kronock mocked sadistically. <BR> <BR>Meanwhile…In the Hall of the Demon… <BR> <BR>Roketh found himself flying rather quickly and evasively around the large establishment. Vyger was trying to help him by attacking Bethemos with assorted breath weapons, but to no avail. He was too weak, battled for too long. Roketh was totally on the defensive now; in no way did he have time to attack. He managed to plant both feet into the far wall. He looked up just in time to see a giant wielding a giant hammer wildly over her head. He took off once more as the massive weapon slammed into the wall that he had just vacated. He was now running on the wall, he knew he couldn&#39;t keep this up. As he looked over his shoulder at the beast dislodging her tool from the wall, he noted a weakness that may buy him some time to get another plan. <BR> <BR>&#34;Quit running around!&#34; Bethemos screamed, obviously frustrated with her own accuracy. <BR> <BR>Roketh was still running the wall, and another was quickly approaching. As he reached the other wall, he springboarded back and took flight towards the demon. He performed this maneuver too quickly for her, but she attempted to slap him out of the air any way. The hammer was now in her right hand, and she swung it with amazing force. Naturally, Roketh dodged this fumbled assault. She spun about three times, trying to regain control of her forceful action. As she stopped spinning, she became even more frustrated. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now where did you go?!&#34; <BR> <BR>Then, she felt a slight tug on her nose ring. As she looked down, almost going cross eyed to see the shrunken dragon holding onto her piercing. Roketh winked once for good measure then ripped the whole Color Pandora nose ring out. He realized that the skeletons might break, but the were reinforced with some alloy he wasn&#39;t familiar with. Immediately her hands came towards her face, so Roketh took this time to head towards Vyger. <BR> <BR>As he landed, he realized that the demon recovered quicker than he thought. He had one arm around Vyger as he stared up at the enraged creature, blood trickling down her chin. She raised her hammer into the air with both hands to finish them both off. <BR> <BR>Then, a bright white flash fired off. In front of the large demon, a small angel appeared. In one hand, a fiery ember burned. In the other, a small twinkle of a ray beam resided. Roketh watch as she placed the heel of her hands together and fired off the biggest explosion of the day into the demon. Bethemos flew backwards, slamming into the wall. Roketh realized he had just learned the secret of the all mighty Bang attack. A mix of Flame and Ray techniques refined. <BR> <BR>She turned and looked at Roketh, &#34;You better hurray, your friends are engaging Kronock.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Who, who are you?&#34; Vyger mumbled. <BR> <BR>&#34;Lets just say something better is for you Vyger, and it most certainly is not Roketh&#39;s time.&#34; She smiled softly, barely parting her lips in a quaint grin as she turned to face the demon again. <BR> <BR>&#34;Roketh…&#34; Vyger spoke slowly, &#34;Take it man, and win.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh looked down into Vyger&#39;s palms. They were glowing white. <BR> <BR>&#34;Roketh, you win for me, you win for Jace, you win for every Lord that sacrificed themselves to save the world. Some believe that it is corrupt, and perhaps they&#39;re right, but the rest of us sure felt like it was worth dying for.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh grasped his hand in a firm grip, and the guardian angel smiled again and was gone in a flash. Roketh felt a tear roll down his cheek as Vyger began fading into nothing, and he still spoke, over and over, &#34;Win for us, win for us all.&#34; <BR> <BR>A bright white flash engulfed the demon&#39;s vision. Bethemos could see nothing but green spots after the bright explosion. When she regained her sight, she noted one of her playthings was gone, and the other was on his knees, in tears. She decided she was going to smash him with her hammer, after all, he ripped out her nose ring. She jumped high into the air, hammer over her head with both hands, and came down with all the force demons&#39; are notorious for. The hammer hit Roketh all right, and went all the way to the ground, crushing Roketh. <BR> <BR>&#34;I win!&#34; Bethemos exclaimed as she held onto the handle. <BR> <BR>Her confidence turned to shock as the hammer began cracking, splitting. The cracks began to glow white as the hammer fell to pieces. Roketh stood there, unfazed, shimmering white. He began walking to the door in a calm fashion. Bethemos stomped and kicked him, but to no avail. Every shot seemed to connect, but wouldn&#39;t even budge him, not even make him stumble from his casual walk. Finally, the demon let out a horrific yell and dove face first at him. She thought she might be able to bite him in half, as she had so many others before him. As she dove at him from behind, he spun quickly. A white, glowing ball appeared in his right hand, his left laid limp at his side. The demon felt fear, but was in midair, and couldn&#39;t stop. Everything seemed in low motion then. She saw his calm expression, the rage burning deep in his eyes. When she saw the corner of his mouth open to reveal clinched teeth, she knew it was over. All she could do was scream as he outstretched his right arm with blinding speed, sending of a wave of pure white energy at the evil being. Roketh saw the giant shadow of the beast bathed in the stream of holy energy. It slowly broke apart and burned into nothing. As Roketh&#39;s palm closed, there was a clear burn trail leading into the far wall. The wall was slightly pressured in from the blast, but not cratered. <BR> <BR>Roketh slowly exited the chamber. He was still slightly puzzled by this angel. Perhaps there was a greater force that preferred to keep things balanced. He didn&#39;t have much time to think though, especially if his allies really were engaging Kronock. <BR> <BR>-Roketh is complete. Even in a completed state, does Kronock still have the upper hand? Will Roketh get back in time?- <BR> <BR>Stay Tuned! CHB
