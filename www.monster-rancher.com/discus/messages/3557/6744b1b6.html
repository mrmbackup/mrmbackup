 Although jells had a very human like society so do many other monsters.  Hengars.  They were fabled amongst the world of monsters, the first ever robots, made by the primals.  They were machines with souls, bionic people.  They did not only work but required rest, food and room. They could survive without humans and had huge cities made just for them.  Begoa was one such city.  It was not a nice place to live though.   <BR>&#34;Sir.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes?&#34; <BR>  <BR>&#34;We need your decision sir.&#34; <BR> <BR>The hengar was a normal type.  Its single green eye looked diligently at a chair. Two other hengars were standing either side.  They looked forward not moving. <BR> <BR>&#34;I will consult my advisors. First general Vladimir.&#34; <BR> <BR>The hengar to his right turned to face the chair.  He looked like a hengar accept for his face; he had two eyes instead of the usual one and a plate above his head.  He was pitch black and angry looking.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Hmmmmm...Do you know which street the offender lives upon sir?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes General.&#34;   <BR> <BR>&#34;In that case I suggest we destroy the entire street, anyone who is not there will be the criminal, we can hunt them down and kill them.&#34; <BR> <BR>The figure in the chair seemed to like this idea from a slow chuckle. <BR> <BR>&#34;Sir if I may?&#34; The figure was thinner and taller than the other.  He was wearing a deep red cloak. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes Carnage?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well there is already a high level of rebel activity in this area.  A full blown attack may push them over the edge.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What do you suggest?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I say we kill the houses off one by one until someone comes forward.&#34; <BR> <BR>The figure seemed to like this idea too.  Vladimir stared over the chair at Carnage with a look of hate. <BR> <BR>&#34;I shall think, bring on my jesters.&#34; The chair cried.  <BR> <BR>Two tiny doors opened on either side of the court like building.  Music played and the entire room seemed to liven up slightly.  A red tassel fell from one door and a white one from the other.  Suddenly two wracky creatures danced out identically.  They were trickers and looked like tiny evil jesters.  One was dressed in white, the other in red.  They danced wildly to the chairs enjoyment. <BR> <BR>A wooden hengar was standing in the room with them.  They did not know this of course. When the chair had been deciding what to do he had been deciding about the automaton in the room. He was hidden behind some blood red curtains and was listening carefully to the conversation.  He held a strange devise in his hand.  The court ended and slowly people left the room, the lights went out.   <BR> <BR>The automaton&#39;s eyes flickered then a beam of light shot through the darkness.  Neos walked slowly down the steps to the thrown like chair.  He placed the device on the red cushion and looked around worriedly.  There was a shot from somewhere and he saw a beam of red fly past one shoulder.  He hit the floor running and rolled behind a table.  The shot had not meant to hit, it had meant to scare him into running. <BR> <BR>&#34;What&#39;s this eh?&#34; He heard the general&#39;s voice from in front of the table. <BR> <BR>There was a shot and the table exploded.  He could see general Vladimir holding the device.  He fired back and the general sidestepped around the shot.  The shots came raining down from both sides.  Not a single hit was made, and then general Vladimir keeled over and fell, his eyes faded.  When a hengars eyes fade it means death.  Smoke was pouring from his back but Neos had no way of hitting it.  He suddenly remembered what the device was.  He ran through the room and leapt through the window.  Glass fell to the ground with him as the bomb exploded sending bricks flying passed him.  The building wavered then collapsed, gray rock fell. <BR> <BR>Neos climbed steadily back to his hidden fortress.  IT was just a whole in the ground but it was well hidden by sewer.  His legs were sparking from the fall and he was jolting slightly, he needed sleep.  He woke to find something strange.  Silence.  In a city so periled by noise silence was unnerving. When he climbed through the sewer to the city he found it blood drenched.  He had killed all those people.  He tried to work out the time.  He had been knocked out for three days.  The castle ruins lay deserted beyond the dead town.  He was an outsider now.  The last one.  The sixth angry outsider.
