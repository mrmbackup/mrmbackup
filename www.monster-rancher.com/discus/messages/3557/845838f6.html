 Disclaimer: Chronicals of Lunarsword is a  <BR>fanfiction to Race Against Darkness and the  <BR>owner of RAD is Ashlee Leidtke. If you want to  <BR>read RAD or any other of her stories, go to her  <BR>homepage at www.geocities.com/liligirl87/ <BR>Mystery.html With that being said, On with the  <BR>story. <BR> <BR>                   Prologue <BR> <BR> <BR>	These were dark, wild times. Creatures with  <BR>powers of the Elements roamed free. This  <BR>made it doubly tough for normal creatures  <BR>because things like the Earth Elementals  <BR>could confine them in vines, the Electric ones  <BR>could shock them in to paralyses, Water could  <BR>drown them and then eat the carcasses, Wind  <BR>could box them in with the most powerful  <BR>winds and then devour them, Fire could  <BR>scorch them if they so much as touched it.  <BR>Darkness could just kill them outright but  <BR>preferred to hypnotize. But luckily for the  <BR>normal creatures, they had one on their side,  <BR>The Elemental of Light. It wasn’t really on any  <BR>ones side, For it had been the cause of all  <BR>this, It was the First and it had created the  <BR>rest. However once it saw the destruction they  <BR>created, It vowed to help any creature. Every  <BR>creature knew this tale, Yet none had ever  <BR>survived going to the Elemental, They had  <BR>always been killed on the way. But our  <BR>character Lunarsword intended to make it.  <BR>When you hear of ‘catlike reflexes’ your  <BR>hearing of a normal cat. Lunarsword was  <BR>much faster than that. He looked on the  <BR>outside like a regular cat, and on the inside to.  <BR>But he was special, he was predicted to help  <BR>seal the Elementals. He had better reflexes  <BR>then a normal cat and and could avoid almost  <BR>any type of attack with a quick jump and could  <BR>usually counter an attack with his long claws,  <BR>that was another odd feature about him, his  <BR>claws were four inches long at full extension,  <BR>and that was what gave him the edge over  <BR>predators. They would tease him, stay just out  <BR>of range of a normal cats claws and he would  <BR>shoot his claws out and usually imbed them  <BR>in the predators nose. And lastly, he could  <BR>sense Elementals even when they were out of  <BR>sight, smell and audibility, They were always  <BR>easy to sense but when they were close he  <BR>could practically feel them. For the past few  <BR>days he had begun to feel a good Elemental,  <BR>The Light Elemental, He was getting close,  <BR>but so was his competition, The only Dark  <BR>Element was out to kill the Light Elemental.  <BR>However he knew that Light Elemental had a  <BR>small chance to beat the Dark Elemental but  <BR>not a big one. <BR> <BR>	The only Light Elemental was in the form of a   <BR>griffin. He sat back, pleased. The creature  <BR>actually had a chance to get to him! It would  <BR>be a first. The creature was getting close but  <BR>so was the Dark Elemental. He was ahead  <BR>but losing ground as the Dark Elemental sped  <BR>on. <BR> <BR>	The Dark Elemental snarled. He could sense  <BR>a creature in front of him. Since he liked  <BR>destruction he would kill the creature. If it was  <BR>going for the Light Elemental it would never  <BR>get there.
