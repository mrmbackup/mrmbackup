 Note:To anyone who&#39;s read my first story. Do you remember when the Dark Raven fired off a shot from it&#39;s primary weapon in chapter 23? ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Chapter 1:Raiders <BR> <BR>Long, long ago...a massive energy surge bombarded a large portion of the IMA continent. Trees, plants, homes...man and monster alike fell before it&#39;s power, disintegrated in an instant. In it&#39;s wake was ruination, a barren, lifeless desert where few plants would grow. Not many creatures could live here, and those that did were kept separate from the empire. It became the place criminals were exiled too, the place garbage and waste were routinely dumped. For this land was now home to the worst of monster kind, rouge&#39;s, thieves...and the Raiders... <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Keep it moving! The sooner we get this food home the sooner we eat! Lets move!&#34; <BR> <BR>A small caravan of monsters struggled through the desert, battling nature itself, a fierce sandstorm. At least most of them were monsters...for leading the group was a young man. Little could be seen of his appearance, except for his dusty brown skin and long raven hair that billowed wildly in the storms fury. A cloth mask covered his mouth and nose, goggles over his eyes, shielding them from the sands painful sting. He walked alongside the caravan, mostly large worms and worm sub-breeds lugging huge metal crates. Each crate was adorned with the same familiar symbol... The bicolored open eye of the Master, framed with the symbol of Moo. To most it was a sign that inspired fear on all who gazed upon it...but to them, it was just something worth taking. <BR> <BR>&#34;Eclipse!&#34; A Renocraft skittered up to the young man, even through the storm you could still hear the grinding in his joints. He was an arrowhead/henger mix and as such didn&#39;t hold out too well in this environment. Alas, like the rest of them, he had no choice. &#34;We&#39;re almost home! Keep driven em forward!&#34; <BR> <BR>The human smiled beneath his mask, quickly patting the Renocraft on the head. &#34;Good, I&#39;d be nice to have some REAL food for a change, eh Stinger?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, no more overly salted fish and 6 month old cup jellies!&#34; With that Stinger rushed ahead of the caravan to inform the others of their impending arrival. Eclipse looked up, finally able to make out the wooden barricades of their humble fort. The fort itself looked rather makeshift at first glance, build from whatever scrape they could find, but it was solid and able to withstand alot of damage. Surrounding it was a collection of small houses and storerooms for food and weapons, a well, and watchtowers. Defending the place was a wall that rose 15 feet into the air. It wasn&#39;t much too look at, but it was home...and for Eclipse the only home he&#39;d ever known. They were almost there...and then..disaster struck... <BR> <BR>The monsters that dwelled in the cities dumped wastes here...and some of the native worms exposed to it had mutated into savage, mindless beasts. One such creature erupted from the parched earth at the head of the caravan, four times the size of any normal worm! It&#39;s body was covered with disgusting yellowish growths, seeping a thick puss at it lashed it&#39;s tail at the lead puller. The helpless raider was impaled onto the beasts stinger and shaken free. Visibility was terrible, all they could see was a massive shape moving towards them with hostile intent...and panic struck. All except one..the human the called Eclipse. Whipping out the crossbow strapped to his back he loaded a steel bolt with practiced ease... <BR> <BR>He just taken aim when he realized...it was coming straight for him! Dropping the weapon Eclipse rolled out of the path of the rampaging beast. He nearly didn&#39;t make it, cutting his arm on one of the muta-worms jagged tusks. The freakish terror lashed out with it&#39;s tail, and Eclipse quickly ducked under it. The human took a second to glance back at the caravan. They were in total disarray and the muta-worm had made the crates it&#39;s target again. Grabbing his crossbow he took aim, through the raging storm, barely able to make out the feint glow of it&#39;s many eyes... A shot rang out and the bolt passed cleanly through one of the muta-worms eye. It screeched and thrashed before turning on Eclipse with avengeance.  <BR> <BR>This time, there was no time to roll out of the way. The beast lowered it&#39;s tusks to gore the human. Eclipse waited until the last moment...and then leapt, landing onto the muta-worms head and clinging for dear-life. It thrashed wildly, and Eclipse could feel his hands burning merely by touching the beast. He couldn&#39;t hold on for much longer..and then it reared up, preparing to slam itself and him into the ground. Suddenly there was an explosion and the beast did indeed fall, landing limp onto it&#39;s side, blood and entrails splattering, sending Eclipse sprawling onto the sand. He landed hard...and then blackness. <BR> <BR>He awoke an hour later within the safety of the Raider Fort. Sitting up on the straw bed Eclipse found himself in his quarters, his mask and goggles removed. The cut on his arm was bandaged, as were his hands. The storm had abated, the relentless fury finally calmed outside. To his surprise he found many of his fellow raiders surrounding him. Stinger was there, as well a Saber the Jagged hound. First and foremost was their leader, a beautiful Night flyer &#40;Pixie/worm&#41;. None of them knew her name, they just called her exactly what she was, the boss.  <BR> <BR>&#34;How are you feeling?&#34; She asked, patting his shoulder reassuringly.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Fine, aside from my headache.&#34; He managed a grin... &#34;But why are-&#34; <BR> <BR>Before he could finish speaking the NightFlyer wrapped her arms around him. &#34;Your lucky that&#39;s ALL you have! You could have been killed fighting that thing.&#34; She pulled back, looking him in the eyes. &#34;But instead you kept it busy long enough for us to nail it. You saved the whole score!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, not bad...for a human. Heh heh...&#34;Saber snarled and was promptly smacked by Stingers tail.. &#34;Ow!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That doesn&#39;t matter, he&#39;s one of us.&#34;Stinger said proudly. &#34;Now lets go join the others so we can eat!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sounds good to me buddy.&#34;Eclipse smiled. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>~Man, I&#39;m full...~ <BR> <BR>He found himself standing by the stone well outside a few hours later, the only source of water within reach. It was the water that prompted them to build the fort in the first place, to surround and protect it. Night had fallen, most of the monsters had already retired, save for the guards in the watchtowers. Leaning against the well he let his mind wander... <BR> <BR>Eclipse, a strange name for a human being, but he&#39;d been named by monsters after all. They&#39;d never kept the secret from him, he&#39;d known since he was old enough to understand that he was found in the ruins of a human settlement. It, like so many others, had resisted the empires rule...and was quickly obliterated. Afterward the Raiders came, descending on the ruin, looking to scavenge up whatever they could... That was fifteen years ago, he was eighteen now. Eclipse had lived among the monsters his whole life and what&#39;s more, aside from vague curiosity he had no real desire to seek out his true roots. This was his family...and it was certainly better then the fate most humans shared these days..slavery. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey, what are you doin still up?&#34; Stinger moved up beside him. &#34;Nice night, we really pulled one over on those idiots.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, we did...Stinger? Ever wonder what it was like in the old days?&#34; Eclipse gazed down at him. He&#39;d heard some strange stories...That at one time this wasteland was teeming with life at one time and monsters were ruled by humans. A world were humans ruled? It seemed incomprehenchable...monsters were superior in everyway. <BR> <BR>&#34;No, the past is gone. Worry about now and get some sleep.&#34;The renocraft replied, almost coldly. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m about to turn in now, don&#39;t worry.&#34;He patted the Renocraft on the head and started towards his room. Stinger was right, it was useless to ponder such things. Fortunately, they wouldn&#39;t need to raid the supply routes for a while now...it was time to get some rest. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>He stared through the black haze trying to make out the figure coming toward him. Floating in an endless sea of nothingness he reached out with his hands but grasped only air. The shape began to take form, forming someone he knew. A woman, but only her outline. All other features were lost in the dark fog. Though her face was not visible this person was familiar, no, he felt their relationship was something more. Finally the fog began to clear, but just before this face in the darkness became visible there was a flash of light, and then...nothing. The image was gone, replaced by an armored crate with the seal of the Master. It was being loaded for transport...and it was important, deathly important. He knew this...but how? It&#39;s unseen contents seemed to call to him, reaching out... And then...and then... <BR> <BR>Eclipse sprang up, awakened from his slumber in the dead of night. All around him was silent, beads of cold sweat on his brow. It was a dream...only a dream. He leaned back in bed, staring up at the ceiling...but the images would not fade. They played over and over in his mind. He closed his eyes, and saw them still, as if burned into the back of his eyelids. It became clear he&#39;d be thinking about them all night. Sitting up he quickly dressed, preparing to see the boss. She&#39;d be royally ticked off to be awakened this time of night, true..but he needed answers..now. <BR> <BR>Sometime later... <BR> <BR>&#34;Boss! I think he&#39;s right. Unbelievable, but the kids dead on.&#34;Saber was looking at a shipment schedule they&#39;d stolen. This one was very recent, they needed to be as routes and times changed frequently to keep cargo away from raiders. Stinger and of course their boss was there as well. Eclipse had managed to persuade her to gather them. Suddenly Saber put his paw on a particular line... &#34;You see this? There is a gap in next weeks shipments.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;So? What does that prove?&#34;Stinger complained, annoyed that he&#39;d been dragged out of bed... <BR> <BR>&#34;It means they are shipping something secret. &#34;Saber continued. &#34;They do this to cover it up, I&#39;ve seen it before. Give me some time and I can probably narrow the time down to the minute.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We&#39;ve got to take it!&#34;Eclipse exclaimed and drew the baffled looks of all present. &#34;I think...no...I know this is important! This could be the score of a lifetime!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No! Even if Saber is right...do you realize how well guarded it&#39;s going to be!?&#34; The lovely Night flyer protested, crossing her arms and folding her wings tightly at her back. &#34;It&#39;s too dangerous.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Boss, living here is dangerous! I dreamt this for a reason...&#34;Eclipse spoke, his face hardened with resolve... &#34;Whatever&#39;s in there we NEED. Who knows, if it&#39;s something valuable enough we can hold it ransom! You can all get formal pardons! We won&#39;t have to live in this hellhole anymore.&#34; <BR> <BR>She fell silent...for what seemed the longest time. It was a tough decision, but the fact remained they needed a big score. The wastelands were becoming more dangerous by the day. Muta-worms were popping up everywhere...it was only a matter of time before they were either killed or driven out anyway. <BR> <BR>&#34;Alright...Saber, get the time and place down. Eclipse, this is your mission, you lead it. Stinger, you will assist him..&#34; She spoke, almost solemnly, fearing for them a great deal. &#34;I&#39;ll trust you with this Eclipse, I have every confidence you&#39;ll succeed.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank you...&#34;Eclipse grinned, clenching his fist in antipation...&#34;Just wait..this is gonna change all our lives, for the better!&#34;

 Hmmm...  Shaping up well by the looks of it. <BR> <BR>You should however, watch spelling of some of the words.  As well as spelling the wrong word in the right place. <BR> <BR>Punctuation as well.  Comma&#39;s are useful for keeping the sentence from sounding like &#39;some body talking too fast&#39;.   <BR> <BR>Spaces too.  Standard to put two spaces after a period, or a period &#43; quote mark.   <BR>Example <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank you...&#34;Eclipse grinned, clenching his fist in antipation...&#34;Just wait..this is gonna change all our lives, for the better!&#34;  <BR> <BR>Should be: <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank you...&#34;  Eclipse grinned, clenching his fist in antipation...  &#34;Just wait..  this is gonna change all our lives, for the better!&#34;  <BR> <BR>I know it is purely cosmetic, but it looks cleaner. <BR> <BR>Anyhow.  thats my .02$&#39;s

 i spoke with black razor a few months ago.  i think he still knows about us, but i do not think this particular sequel is high on his list of ongoing projects at this time.  of course, the original &#34;rise of the master&#34; remains one of the all time great mr epics, and those who have not read it, i encourage to do so. <BR> <BR>yes, daeore, he could be more grammatical or &#34;spell-checkable&#34; throoughout.  nonetheless, i like it a lot.

 Hi all. Things have been hectic and life has a way of interfering with ones writing habits. Nonetheless I was just thinking about coming back to finish this story a month or so ago, and I think I&#39;ll do just that. Hopefully I&#39;ll have at least one new chapter before the month is out.
