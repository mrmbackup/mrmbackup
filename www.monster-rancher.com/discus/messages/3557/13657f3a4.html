 The rangers were going through the dark crevasse, a lonely and foul-smelling hall-way in Mahjor&#39;s fortress. <BR> <BR>     Pictures of tortured monsters were plastered on the walls. They were all covered in blood. Of course, the ones who were torturing had the Skull with the star. This was called, a &#34;Mahjio-gram&#34;, as the rangers later learned. Soluv, along with the other rangers, wondered how Mahjor could be capable of doing this. <BR>      <BR>     Once they passed this horrible hall-way, they made their way to a large room. &#34;It&#39;s like we were meant to pass through this building, like Mahjor set this place up to test us. I feel like we were led through this place. Isn&#39;t there another way into the main hall-way?&#34; Solon asked. Suddenly, Zagref noticed a blur. A blur so fast, it was almost unoticable. Soluv was smashed in the back and was sent flying. Then Solon, then Zagref. Hijora, before it could smash him, punched it in the face. He laughed at the blur, which turned out to be a Zan. Zagref got up and looked at it. &#34;He has the seal of Mahjor, a Mahjio-gram.&#34; Solon, being very tempermental, grabbed it by the collar, asked it, &#34;Who the he#$ are you working for!?&#34; The Zan just looked at them. &#34;Excuse the language earlier.&#34; Solon said. The Zan looked pale. He looked like he failed something. Like he was sad. Then, the Mahjio-gram suddenly disappeared. &#34;What happened to it&#39;s Mahjio-gram!?&#34; Soluv asked. Hijora&#39;s face looked angry. Zagref felt it, it was dead. <BR> <BR>     &#34;That was pretty freaky. But do you think that the disappearance of the seal killed it?&#34; Zagref was puzzled. Hijora was also troubled. &#34;I bet Mahjor didn&#39;t need him anymore, so he just finished him off. I bet, if you&#39;ve got the seal, you keep it until you are no longer needed. Then Mahjor finishes you off.&#34; They looked around the room. It had hundreds of doors all over. They went through a door to the left. They opened it and they ended up coming out the door across from the one they went in. &#34;What the...&#34; Zagref said. They went in another door with a little crack in the middle, and went in. A Ghost was in front of them. &#34;I am the Ghost of Huong, once a Suezo, but taken down by &#34;Aum&#34;, the right-hand of Mahjor...&#34; <BR> <BR>     &#34;If you wish to advance towards the Grand Hall, follow the cracks I leave in the doors. Every door that doesn&#39;t have the cracks that I leave, is a trap. You only went through an alternate dimension first, but it&#39;ll be worse the next time. Follow the cracks, or die.&#34; The rangers folowed the cracks. But, out of the shadows, the Great Betrayer scratched cracks in a door. Sadly, the rangers went through. In front of them, 100 of Mahjor&#39;s minions were prepared for battle. &#34;No...&#34; Zagref said, faintily. &#34;We went through the wrong door.&#34; <BR> <BR>To be continued...
