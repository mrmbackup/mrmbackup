 As the skinny fake penguin dragged the basket of crushed mint leaves up the stairs, the jelly hound and moaigom looked on with pity. They knew what was going to happen to the little guy once he made his delivery. It was always the same drill. Nearing the bedroom door, the mocchi looked down to see his friends begin to head outside to wait for him. <BR>Waiting several minutes before answering the knock on her door, Seth made herself busy by preparing a apple and cinnamon potpourri. Placing the unlit candle underneath the pot, she turned to let the monster in. The weary thing pulled the basket through the door, and set it next to the bed. Smiling, the rancher&#39;s assistant pointed to the window. Without having to look up, the mocchi knew what she was doing and expected. <BR>Sighing deeply, the creature climbed up to the window sill and jumped. Crying out in pain, it&#39;s hard fall two stories down was greeted by rocks and devile&#39;s club. Seth always loved the sound that the impact of the fall made. Watching wounded monsters trying to make their way out of the thorny patch of vines managed to put her in high spirits more than anything else. Grabbing the basket, she rushed to the window to enjoy the veiw. <BR>Looking down, she became annoyed to see the golem and tiger trying to help the unconscious mocchi get out of it&#39;s plight. Quickly chewing some of the mint, she began spitting wads on their heads to show her displeasure. Despite the discomfort of the thorns and filth, the two monsters gingerly made their way in. Leaning down over the poor little mocchi, they fell to their knees and cried. <BR>Seth perked up. Not only did that silly little thing kill itself, but the interfering pests had punished themselves for trying to help the mocchi cheat. Spitting out her last wad on top of their heads, she yelled,&#34;Take it to the kitchen NOW!&#34;. <BR> <BR>Pulling dresses out of her bureau, she laid them out on her bed to consider. These particular dresses Seth had made with Carl in mind. The three were made of different materials; canvas, suede, and cashmere. What they had in common was; the tight fit emphasizing her T&amp;A, low V-cut in front, and seams that could easily be ripped apart. <BR>Fustrated that the old goat hasn&#39;t been as attentive to her as he used to, she began making arrangements to tempt and tease him into begging for her favors. Although three times her age, he has a special place in her cold black heart. A woman of her refined charms and intelligence, couldn&#39;t allow herself to be considered easy. No matter that she loves Carl, he must give her the proper respect. The respect that she craves is the cute way that he pleads with her to submit to his animalistic desires. <BR>Stripping down, Seth rubbed the crushed mint over her entire body. Choosing the cashmere dress, she pulled and tugged her way into it. Glancing around, she checked to make sure everything is in place for him to invade her privicy. The potpourri is ready to be lit. The wine is within reach of the bed. And her lute was tuned for her serenade. <BR> <BR>With the morning sun lighting the way, Carl turned the wagon onto the left trail that followed Milk River. The old man smiled at the carved trees, amused that they can still have their intended affect. <BR>Fluffy, to her credit, deserves the sleep that she is now getting. It was quite a feat driving a wagon all night in unfamiliar territory. A monster as smart as her might even be useful handing him stuff as he works in the lab. Maybe, she can even be taught how to count. The necromancer then scolded himself for coming up with such a fanciful thought. No. Monsters are too stupid to know how to read and write. Most are even too dumb to know how to talk. Carl chuckled at the image of a monster counting coins and holding an open book. Ah, the imagination does run wild. <BR> <BR>Late morning brought the veiw of his tower poking up above the forest. Soon, the trail curved north and met the thirteen foot tall granite wall that surrounds his ranch. Approaching the gate triggered an undead sentry to sound the gong. This alerted Seth that her master has arrived. <BR> <BR>Not wanting to seem overly eager, Seth took her time to open the gate. Before leaving the house, she dipped her fingers into the blood of the mocchi being prepared for dinner. Looking into a silver platter, she decorated her lips with the sticky red juice. Slowly, searching for a monster to inflict misery upon the way, she headed to her beloved. <BR> <BR>Aware of how long it takes for Seth to open that dang blasted gate, Carl got off the wagon to take a leak. Washing his hands in a rain barrel, he grunted out curses concerning his ungrateful inconsiderate assistant. Perhaps it&#39;s time to get one that isn&#39;t so hateful towards him. It wouldn&#39;t matter if a new assistant isn&#39;t as good with monsters as Seth is, just so long as she knows her place! <BR>Not wanting to wait alone, the old man went into the wagon to wake Fluffy. The kitten misunderstanding her master&#39;s intentions, reached under his kilt. <BR> <BR>Having drank in the moaigom&#39;s tears, Seth unlocked the gate&#39;s slide bolt. A loud strange monstrous noise startled her. The piercing cry of pain sounded out again, tapering off to a growl. <BR>The assistant quickly relocked the gate, and began to look for which one of her monsters got itself in trouble. Torment this intense she didn&#39;t want to miss. Carl was just going to have to wait a little longer. <BR>Looking around the ranch, she didn&#39;t find anything amiss. The inhuman screams of anguish did not reoccur to give her a clue to it&#39;s origin. Baffled, she resumed opening the gate. Swinging the large doors open, she stood to the side and posed. With her back to the wall, she crossed her arms in such a way to lift her greatest charms. <BR>Taking the attention off herself, she turned her gaze towards the old goat. She had to do a double take. Next to that coot, there&#39;s something that looks like a pixie driving the wagon. And, Carl has the biggest smile that he&#39;s had in years! <BR>Face turning sour and her finger pointing at Fluffy, she bellowed,&#34;What is that thing doing here?! She&#39;s not staying!&#34;. Stomping around the zombie to get at the kitten, she continued her tirade. &#34;I&#39;m going to skin this myself! You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing, do you old man?! You probably got fleas... <BR>Fluffy jumped into the wagon and Seth began climbing up to catch her. With the heel of his hand, the necromancer hit his assistant hard under the chin, sending her falling back onto the ground. Taking the reins, he urged the wagon on, before he gave into the temptation to hit her again. <BR>Sitting on the ground. Dress dirty and torn. The deep bleeding wound in her heart cried out for revenge. That pixie was not just going to die. When she got through with that beast, it&#39;ll be begging for death. And Carl will be the one to give it the sweet release. <BR> <BR>During dinner, Seth was still too hurt to join Carl for the meal. Instead, she tied the jell hound to a post surrounded by hay and pine boughs. She then chained it&#39;s friend, the moaigom, into a bundle nearby. Lighting the hay on fire, she forced the golem to watch it&#39;s companion die a horrible agonizing death. Not satisfied, she fed the big monster the remaining goo that was once the tiger. Sitting down with a jug of wine, she drank herself into a stuper, while watching the retching and wailing of the golem.

 um...i don&#39;t like seth very much. <BR> <BR>does anyone remember black beauty?  who will write the black beauty of the world of monster rancher? <BR> <BR>whether this story takes such a turn or not, in swift strokes a world has been created where all humans use all monsters, as part of their birthright.  some humans are better than others, though.

Thanks, Jello. <BR>The way I see Colt is that she&#39;s nicer and too sexy to write about without getting banned. <FONT COLOR="119911">I love my fantasy world. <FONT FACE="WINGDINGS">&#74;</FONT></FONT> <BR>I gave a brief description as how I imagine her in ALMIGHTY LISA&#39;s post =<FONT COLOR="0000ff"> Short Fiction : &#34;Please read this... this is not a question though. IT&#39;S GONNA BE FUN!&#34;</FONT> <BR>Also, this story takes place on a different continent than FIMBA and IMA.
