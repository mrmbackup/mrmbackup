 Note:Thought I&#39;d stopped didn&#39;t you? Ha! I&#39;m far from finished, if time permits I&#39;ll have new chapters out on a more regular basis. This ones another plot developer, the real action starts next chapter. <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter 14:Preparing for War <BR> <BR>&#34;Beatdown!?&#34;Claw said as he gazed through the metal bars. It was the first time he was actually glad to see the little fairyhare. She stood in a dark hallway, the walls made of some strange black metal. A string of lights blazed along ceiling. Beatdown looked a bit worn out, but otherwise alright.&#34;How the hell did you get in here? Nevermind, tell me later. Right now get the door open.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok!&#34;Beatdown cried before she punched the door.&#34;Oww! That hurt!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Of course it hurt, it&#39;s metal you moron!!&#34;Stone claw screamed at her.&#34;Look for a knob or a latch or something, maybe a button?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You can&#39;t get out like that.&#34;Shielka&#39;s voice was heard from the next cell, cold and deeply depressed. &#34;You&#39;d need a key, it&#39;s flat and square.&#34; <BR> <BR>Claw turned back to beatdown.&#34;Hear that? You&#39;ve got to find a key.&#34;  <BR> <BR>But the fairyhare didn&#39;t respond, she only crossed her arms and turned away saying.&#34;Why should I help you after calling me a moron?&#34; <BR> <BR>Claw wanted to smack the hare just then but didn&#39;t for a few reasons. He couldn&#39;t reach her for one thing. Second, it was only a matter of time before someone came to check on him or shielka, at which point beatdown would be found out. Instead he calmed down and said, &#34;Alright, I&#39;m sorry for calling you a moron...There, are you happy?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, ok I&#39;ll be right back. Don&#39;t worry, if anyone gets in my way I&#39;ll smackem good!&#34;Beatdown started boxing at imaginary things once again.&#34;See, just like this.&#34; Claw watched her scamper down the hall and disappear. The trident slumped back and waited. His claustrophobia was beginning to subside, he began to wonder about this place he was in. If beatdown could pull it off and retrieve a key, how would they escape? Claw was barely conscious when he was thrown into this cage, but they had walked a long way to get to the cells. Even if they somehow found the exit, this was ship flying high in the air, would they be forced to jump? As these thoughts wandered through his mind, Claws exhaustion finally began to take it&#39;s toll. He closed his eyes and fell into a deep slumber.... <BR> <BR>Some time passed, minutes, hours perhaps, before the trident awoke. He lept up and looked through the bars above his door. All was dark and silent, beatdown was nowhere to be seen, something was wrong. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes with a stone hand, analyzing his surroundings more closely. The hall dead quiet, save for the occasional sound of banging metal or the feint tap of far off footsteps. He also found it quite strange that no guard had been posted to watch them. It was clear, no one to stop him, all he needed was to escape from this cell. Where was that blasted hare?? Claw slid down and began pacing back and forth, he stopped, feeling eye&#39;s upon him. Looking up he saw Shielka, watching through the grating. Claw swired his bulk around and gave her a look as to say, &#39;What are you lookin at??&#39;.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Well?&#34;Stone claw asked with an annoyed tone,&#34;You have anything useful to say? Like an escape plan? Or are you just gonna sit in your cell?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Give it a rest.&#34;She replied&#34;This is a hopeless situation. Don&#39;t be fooled by the lack of guards. On this ship are hundreds of deactivated hengers, and not normal ones either. They have weird weapons from the time this ship was built, thats not counting those freaks in the generation chamber. Every hall is constantly monitored, any door can be locked by the master in an instant. You can&#39;t see them, but their are things that pop out of the walls and shoot at you, lasers talus called them. I bet this place has a hundred other nasty surprises that the master never bothered to tell me about. This place is a weapon, it&#39;s designed to kill it&#39;s target, inside or outside it doesn&#39;t matter...you wouldn&#39;t get ten feet without getting blasted.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, probably.&#34;Claw said, and resumed his thinking.&#34;And your point?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Your going to get killed! Thats my point.&#34;Shielka said and she began to sink back into her depressed state, muttering things claw couldn&#39;t quite hear. One thing was clear however, she&#39;d given up, and that made the Trident sick to his stomach as well as furious. He turned to the daina and asked if she wanted revenge. She fingered the symbol that hung around her neck. &#34;I answered yes to that question once...look where I ended up....We&#39;re dead, might as well accept it.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Maybe already have,&#34;Claw hissed&#34;But I&#39;m still not giving up, not yet, they can beat the crap out of me all day, I still won&#39;t. Yes, we may both die. But I&#39;m gonna take a whole lot of those bastards with me! Your really making me sick, forget the past, what matters now is kicking the Masters ass!&#34; He stopped then, hearing the patter of feet scurry down the hall. Claw looked out and saw beatdown, she was waving a key card.&#34;Ha! So much for the masters security system! Good job!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Uh, I guess it goes here.&#34;Beatdown stuffed the card into a slot. A light above blinked from red to green and the card was promptly returned. The fairyhare then proceed to do the same operation with the next cell. Once again, the light turned green and the card returned. Claw pushed the thick metal door open with ease before going to shielka&#39;s. To his surprise, she was standing right there. One of her wings had a horrible gash. <BR> <BR>&#34;Coming?&#34;He said and she stepped out, watching the cell close automatically. <BR> <BR>&#34;We have to hurry,&#34;She said with ugency&#34;This ship is headed straight for a battle with Moo. Once that happens this place will be on alert and it will be nearly impossible to escape.&#34; <BR> <BR>Suddenly the lights above began to flare bright red, filling the entire hall with a crimson glow. The sound of machinery grinding and moving could be heard, heavy footsteps echoed throughout the ship. Claw and Beatdown glanced about in alarm. Had they been detected already? They had only just escaped from the cells! Stone claw asked the daina what was wrong. <BR> <BR>&#34;They&#39;ve found Moo.&#34;She said&#34;It&#39;s starting...&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Justice? Man, are you nuts!?&#34;Ganthor complained as he an celine followed their durahan leader through the dark halls of Moo&#39;s floating fortress. It was not long after first meeting Gray wolf. The servant of Moo offered an invitation which justice accepted. Everyone thought he was crazy, but justice knew what he was doing. Moo&#39;s forces had been devastated by the masters minions, his entire plan of invasion for this continent gone up in smoke. He thought back to the town of golran, where moo&#39;s troops were interrogating the locals for information. Justice was convinced that the evil one knew something that could help him in his own goal. It had also occurred to him, that Moo&#39;s fortress may be the only thing that could stop the raven. As for being killed, the durahan had little fear of that. His only concern was for his two companions who insisted on coming along and yet still complained. <BR> <BR>Now they followed Gray wolf through the dark, twisting passages that reminded him of the inside of a ribcage. The fortess was a frightening piece of work, though strangely ingenious in design. Great slabs of natural obsidian blended seamless with ancient technology. It was strange to see automatic doors in what felt like a dungeon. Troops constantly patrolled, doing their rounds, saluting gray wolf as he passed and giving justice cold glares.  <BR> <BR>Finally, they came to a great chamber that looked like a control room of sorts. Glass panels lined the far walls, providing an instant glimpse of the outside world. In the center of the floor was a huge golden symbol, the same as all moo&#39;s servants bore. Standing upon that symbol, towering over all that stood before him, was the single most imposing creature they&#39;d ever laid eye&#39;s upon. For all his long years battling in the tournaments, nothing had ever prepared Justice for this...monstrosity. Teeth like daggers, long talons that have cleaved many monsters. His body was massive, powerful muscle covered with gray fur. Black wings stood folded, like ebony spires. His glance alone seemed it would cut them in half, as the trio at last beheld the great Moo. <BR> <BR>&#34;Welcome...&#34;He grinned, bearing row upon row of deadly fangs.&#34;My guests.&#34; Moo stepped forward and they shrinked back, justice himself seemed to lose his nerve temporarily. The great dragon only laughed at this action.&#34;There&#39;s a reaction I get offen. I wonder why. Stop cringing, you won&#39;t die...yet.&#34; <BR> <BR>Surprised by his own reaction, justice regained his composure and stepped forward, Celine and Ganthor remained where they were.&#34;Why have you brought me hear moo? How did you know who I was?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You...and another, killed many of my troops in the pitiful human settlement Golran.&#34;Moo replied.&#34;I do not forget such things durahan...as for what your here for, I believe you already know. Who or what is the Master? Who dare has the imputence to challenge me!?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You don&#39;t know?&#34;Justice said&#34;I thought you could tell me Moo. I have no idea wha- <BR> <BR>Moo suddenly grabbed justice with one hand, threatening to crush his steel form. &#34;You know something! Tell me!&#34; Moo was practically breathing fire as he spoke, justice was afraid of melting under the heat of his breath. Celine and Ganthor got over their fears and tried to aid the durahan. But the stronghorn was knocked down after being backhanded by moo, whom didn&#39;t even seem to feel Celine&#39;s mega-rays. A moment later the room became flooded with naga&#39;s and terror dogs. They quickly surrounded the others and justice was helpless to stop the minions of moo. <BR> <BR>&#34;Tell me,&#34;Moo said, much calmer now.&#34;Or they die.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Let them go,&#34;Justice said&#34;I know nothing I swear.&#34; <BR> <BR>The dragon shook his head,&#34;Pity,&#34; He said before dropping justice to the ground. In an instant terror-dogs surrounded him, growling and snapping. <BR>&#34;There is no need for you then....kill them.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;M-m-master Moo!!&#34;A weed yelled, pointing a branch toward the window.&#34;Look!&#34; And he indeed looked, and saw a black Raven hovering close, energy surged and gathered at it&#39;s head as it prepared to cry it&#39;s deadly song. <BR> <BR> <BR>End of chapter 14:Coming soon, Moo&#39;s floating fortress vs. The Dark Raven. Which will survive??
