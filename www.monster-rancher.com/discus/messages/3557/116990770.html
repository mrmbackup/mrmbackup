 This is by far my favorite addition to the MDA. It&#39;s only action, and we love action. The plot thicked enough in 1-4, now its time for 5 to get into the real plot line. Enjoy! <BR> <BR>The MDA Chap 5: Of Ninja and Samurai <BR> <BR>The night was as silent as a school classroom. Sear slept in the corner of the cave, while Jango sat at the front, looking out into the wilderness. He was dozing off, but knew it was best to keep watch, even though Sear insisted that he slept. <BR> <BR>“Click” <BR> <BR>Jango quickly shot upwards at the sound. He looked down, and saw a slight movement. <BR> <BR>“Something’s down there,” he whispered. <BR> <BR>He moved over to wake Sear, but wasn’t fast enough. <BR> <BR>“AHHHHHH!” Jango screamed in agony as a shuriken pierced his mid section. Luckily, the pain was only temporary, and his wound healed. He spun around to face his assailant. A black robed figure stood at the mouth of the cave. <BR> <BR>“Ninja!” jingo yelled to alert Sear, but too late.  <BR> <BR>With just a flick of his wrist, the ninja sent ten more shuriken through Jango. He yelped in pain as one scratched his heart. Sear awoke; scythe in hand, and charged the ninja. He let loose two more shuriken, but Sear swept up his cloak and barely avoided them. They instantly met in close range combat. <BR> <BR>Sparks flew as Sear’s scythe met the ninja’s katana. The blades were so fast they made Jango’s head spin. The madness continued as Sear continued to parry and thrust, but the ninja was just too fast. For a split second, Sear let down his guard, and the ninja took the advantage. <BR> <BR>“NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!” Jango watched as the ninja sent his katana through Sear’s mask, shattering it. The cloak fell limp, and the hands melted into thin air. Sear was dead. <BR> <BR>The ninja turned and charged at Jango.  <BR> <BR>“Darn you!” yelled Jango, the ninja bolting through the cave, “I’ll kill you!!!” <BR> <BR>Jango instantly pulled in his arms and jutted them back out in the form of swords. He placed them in an X, and met the ninja’s katana head on. Sparks flew as Jango flailed his arms. He was driven only by rage now. The ninja could hardly parry, let alone strike back. Jango cornered the ninja against the cave wall. Jango let his arm tear through the air, and when the ninja tried to parry, his sword flew from his arm and into the cave wall. <BR> <BR>“I’ve got you now, scum,” he said in a shaking voice, “This is for my friend!” <BR> <BR>“On the contrary!” the ninja pulled a katar from his waist, and jabbed it into Jango so fast that Jango didn’t know he was hurt until he felt the pain. But something was wrong, the wound wasn’t healing. Jango keeled over, and began to spit up a mixture of metallic jell and blood. The katar had hit right on the mark, leaving a wide gash in Jango’s heart. Jango lay face up, as the ninja stood over him. The pain was unbearable. <BR> <BR>“Do not fear,” say the ninja reassuringly, “You’ll soon be joining your friend in the after life.” <BR> <BR>The ninja pulled out another katana, held it so the blade was down so that it pointed at the center of Jango’s now exposed heart. <BR> <BR>“Give him my regards,” the ninja pulled the blade up, and then sent it soaring down towards Jango. <BR> <BR>“It can’t end like this!” Jango sprang to life and plunged his sword arm through the ninja’s abdomen. The ninja feel to his knees, and a stream of blood poured from the wound and onto the cave floor. The mask the ninja wore now was stained with blood, he was internally bleeding. Jango put his arm to the ninja’s throat. The ninja looked up at him. <BR> <BR>“Why don’t you give Sear the message,” Jango whispered as more blood poured from his mouth. With that, he swept his arm to the left and opened the ninja’s throat. Blood sprang forward as the ninja fell over, dead. <BR> <BR>“You have been avenged, my friend,” Jango said as he slipped into blackness. But as he did, he noticed five dark figures at the mouth of the cave. He didn’t care. He had accomplished his goal. <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>“I have heard many things about you, Keemo of the MDA,” said the voice that Keemo knew belonged to Lord Writhe, “I have heard of your triumphs, and strengths.” <BR> <BR>“Indeed,” Keemo tried not to say anything that would offend the mighty beast, “I am Keemo, founder of the MDA. With my power and my speed, I have thwarted many foes.” <BR> <BR>“Big deal,” Lord Writhe said in a sarcastic tone, “You tell me nothing but what any typical Raiden can do, but can you show me these so called powers of yours?” <BR> <BR>With that, Keemo heard a switch flick, and a trap door opened up beneath him. He had no idea where he was, or where he was going. He swiftly fell through a network of tunnels, until he saw a light up ahead, and heard an applause coming from what seemed a large crowd. <BR> <BR>Keemo fell from a hole in the sky into a large stunt bag. When he got out, and looked up. He was amazed at what he saw. A large coliseum made entirely of black marble. Such a rare stone, it was an amazing that so much could be hidden here. It was so loud he couldn’t think straight. Everyone was cheering. And then, one word could be heard over and over again as the entire crowd said it. <BR> <BR>“KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL!” <BR> <BR>Keemo was scared now. He looked around as everyone kept repeating that awful word, beckoning him to keel over and die. Then, a flourish of trumpets was heard and everyone was silenced. From a box in the stands, a Beerock stepped forward. His high shoulders, pointed beak, and expensive cake let Keeno know who it was. <BR> <BR>“Lord Writhe,” Keemo muttered under his breathe. <BR> <BR>Lord Writhe began to speak. <BR> <BR>“On this day, I have put together a much anticipated event,” said Writhe as the crowd applauded. He put up his hand, and they fell silent, “I am pleased to give you Keemo, of the MDA! In fact, his reputation as a detective never fails him, except for when he falls into one of the most stupid traps of all time!” The crowd laughed at Writhe’s remark, then, another hand silenced them. This time, he addressed Keemo. <BR> <BR>“My good boy, do you remember when you crushed the Sasuke Army?”  <BR> <BR>Keemo froze in terror. That had been his hardest gang assignment ever. A clan of ruthless samurai, the Sasukes would stop at nothing to see the innocent suffer. He almost lost his life in the battle with them. <BR> <BR>“Well today,” began Writhe, “I will jog your memory, with a reenactment of the final battle!” <BR> <BR>The crowd cheered as the golden doors opened at either end of the stadium. From them, emerged ten samurai, each brandishing katanas, nagitas &#40;curved spears&#41;, and unique armor that would obviously not be penetrated easily. However, Keemo was more concerned with another issue. Will he be given a weapon? <BR> <BR>As if Writhe had read his mind, he sent Onslaught down to the field with a katana. Onslaught handed the katana to Keemo, and muttered, “Good luck. I will pray for your victory.” With that, Onslaught returned to the stands. Keemo, pulled his katana from its sheath, and raised it over his head. The crowd cheered, and the trumpets blew. <BR> <BR>Writhe rose from the stands and shouted, “BEGIN!!!” <BR> <BR>One of the samurai, a Ripper, darted the minute the words rolled off of Writhe’s tongue. He pulled his katana, and made for Keemo. Keemo parried, and the crowd cheered as the Ripper sent blows at Keemo that were so fast, Keemo was lucky he could parry them. He spun around the Ripper as he parried, and severed the Ripper’s long tail. The crowd cheered, as the ripper howled in pain. <BR> <BR>“Monsters,” Keemo muttered as the crowd cheered even louder when the blood began to run from the Ripper’s torso. With that, Keemo put another slash through the Ripper’s armor, and ended his life. The crowd cheered, the fight was on. <BR> <BR>Keemo picked up the Ripper’s katana, as two more samurai, a Mew and a Hare, charged him. Keemo parried left and right as the two new foes came in from either side of him. He was a little dazed, and the Mew instantly put a gash in Keemo’s side. The crowd cheered as blood began to run down Keemo’s side. <BR> <BR>“Monsters,” he thought.  <BR> <BR>He screamed as he knocked the katanas out of the samurais’ hands and put a hole in each of their necks. The crowd cheered as blood shot forth from the wounds. Now a dead Ripper, Hare, and Mew lay strewn across the field. Now a Madillo and a Kagemusha came at him. The Madillo was clumsy, and Keemo ducked and put a hole in his chest. The crowd cheered and the Madillo feel limp to the ground. The Kagemusha, however, was a skilled fighter, and Keemo and the Kagemusha went on for a good twenty minutes before Keemo sent his sword between the top and lower part of the armor. A white light burst forth, and the Kagemusha fell into a useless pile of scrap metal.  <BR> <BR>The crowd was muttering the same chant now. <BR> <BR>“KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL!” <BR> <BR>Keemo looked up and realized what had happened. The five remaining samurai, all Garus, had boxed him in during his fight with a Kagemusha. Now he was surrounded, and had a true challenge on his hands. <BR> <BR>At that, all five Garu charged him, he moved to left, flipped a Garu over his back and plunged his katana into the chest. More yells from the crowd came as Keemo dodged an attack from two sides and had two Garus kill each other. The stadium floor was now stained red. All eyes were upon Keemo and the last two Garus.  <BR> <BR>One immediately charged Keemo. Keemo was slow to react, and a gash appeared on his cheek. He hollered in pain, the crowd hollered in joy, as a stream of blood soaked the feathers on his face. He immediately grabbed the handle of the Garu’s sword, and began to turn it. Despite his efforts, the Garu samurai could not overpower a Raiden, and soon his own blade was plunged into the Garu’s neck. A flow of blood shot forth, and the Garu fell. One Garu remained, but he wasn’t afraid. Samurai were trained not to fear death. <BR> <BR>This samurai was smart, however, and pulled forth his nagita. The long spear had a clear advantage over Keemo’s katana. With that, the samurai charged, and Keemo parried. Keemo was unable to counter-attack because of the length of the spear, so he kept parrying.  <BR> <BR>“KLANK!” <BR> <BR>Sparks flew as metal hit metal. Keemo still had a clear disadvantage, but found his moment. The samurai cleared a small path for Keemo, and Keemo darted in and opened up the Garu’s chest. Blood shot forth, and the Garu started to spit blood. The Garu held up his katana he had kept on his belt, and was going for a kamikaze. Keemo stood tall, and slashed through the Garu’s neck. It fell over, and its head fell and rolled across the stadium floor. The entire crowd stood up, and unified a new chant. <BR> <BR>“KEEMO! KEEMO! KEEMO! KEEMO!” <BR> <BR>Keemo held up his sword, and the crowd applauded. He had proven himself, and was now ready for a true audience with Lord Writhe. However, the guard poured from the gate with swords and spears. All pointed towards him. <BR> <BR>“No,” Keemo said, “Writhe wants me dead anyway…”  <BR> <BR>I love this Chapter. Hope you liked it! -Icelord13

 I know this chapter doesn&#39;t have Kala, but that&#39;s because I based it on action and samurai and ninjas. Kala wasn&#39;t going to face any of that. But don&#39;t worry, kala will play an important role n Chap 6! As I said to dm, if you keep reading, I&#39;ll keep writing! :&#41;

 Oh, I read alright! Quite a shot! Nice gore, and you, possibly unintentionally, thickened Jango&#39;s plot quite a bit, in an enemy&#39;s hideout, surrounded by foes...too many commas...Oh well...I can&#39;t wait!

 A couple of things. Firstly, try not to repeat words in such succession. Two Examples: <BR> <BR>&#34;“On the contrary!” the ninja pulled a katar from his waist, and jabbed it into Jango so fast that Jango didn’t know he was hurt until he felt the pain.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;He was a little dazed, and the Mew instantly put a gash in Keemo’s side. The crowd cheered as blood began to run down Keemo’s side.&#34; <BR> <BR>Instead of saying a name repeatedly, you can refer to the breed instead. Like, The Metal Jell, or just the Jell, or the proud Raiden, or just the Raiden. <BR> <BR>Just a suggestion. And I would have liked the Samurai part to have lasted longer than it did. For the legacy of his most challenging assignment, they sure did die easy. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t like him appealing to the crowd after killing, makes HIM look like the monster. <BR> <BR>Garus with Naginatas are disturbing. Keemo should have used hands and fists, like a Raiden. <BR> <BR>My only complaints, but even those weren&#39;t enough to keep me from being drawn into the story. And they are, of course, merely suggestions based on tastes, my tastes, so not everyone will agree. <BR> <BR>I did, most assuredly, enjoy this chapter, especially the Ninja. And gore is always a plus in my book, ask anyone.

 Well, remember CHB, those aren&#39;t the actual samurai, they&#39;re just bums with the armor who dont know how to fight. If I had put Keemo up against the actual Sasuke Army, it would have been different. And i dont no why, but ive always liked battles with weapons over battles with fists. Samurai bujutsu was all about the weaponry. I had to play it by history. Thanks fer the comments, and ill be sure to use them to improve.

 Well, making the Samurai human would have worked, or even Durahans. Just have trouble with a Garu with a Naginata :D <BR> <BR>I did enjoy the chapter though, cept Sear died, he was cool...

 Well, I see what ur sayin, but the Black Hand is a monster gang. They don&#39;t take kindly to humans. And I get comments on this story from harrab on the chats, and he said i used to many rare monsters. If they had all been Kagemushas, he would have freaked. And about Sear, I liked him too. But, oh well. More will come soon! :&#41;

 This is becoming a great epic, Icelord. I really don&#39;t know what else to say, as once again, you have left me speechless. I am glad to be able to read your works of art, and am greatly looking forward to the next installment.
