 Kingston was dead and, at long last, so was his legacy of terrors. With the last of his minions destroyed, the trio was free to begin their search for Kronock, the unknown deity of terror. As they conversed as they tread their weary path, Galin and Roketh learned much of their new companion. Moonshadow had been orphaned at birth; an old and wise hermit in the Mountains had raised him and War. They endured great hardships there, which they benefited from in the future. Their hard training efforts were tested against an evil hare army. A battle which the two won rather dominantly. Now, with War dead, Moonshadow figured he had nothing left to lose and thus, joined the ranks of the Lord of the Elements. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, any idea as to were we shall find such a fiend? Perhaps the mountains? I know how to handle myself their, and you two just might learn something.&#34; Moonshadow said, mockingly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Actually, that seems like a good bet. Little to know traffic, out of the way of any searches, and if he was raising an army, he could easily hide it.&#34; Galin said as he glanced up at the mountains in the distance. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, but keep in mind we may not be able to beat him now. We must find the other Lords, lest they be victims of Kronock. If he does get a hold of even one, we may not be powerful enough to stop him.&#34; Roketh said as he too, stared up at the mountains. <BR> <BR>Suddenly, a scream cut through the forest. The threesome stopped in their tracks and eyed their surroundings. They heard it again, coming from a small, dirt path that led off the main road. Moonshadow bolted down the small path as the massive dragons were forced to take flight. Roketh and Galin glided overhead and soon spotted a large clearing. In it, lay the corpse of a dryad. About five Wood Knights were clustered around a young group of other dryads, dryad children. Beside the corpse, a small band of creatures laughed, no doubt being the ones to kill the Pixie/Mock. The two dragons landed in-between the Wood Knights and the band of marauders. Moonshadow quickly sprung from the woods and landed a short ways in front of the hulking winged monsters. <BR> <BR>&#34;Petty fools, leave while you still have legs to walk on.&#34; One of them spoke as it stepped closer to them, obviously the leader. <BR> <BR>He was a Naga, a fairly large one at that. Even more astonishing was its intellect. The Naga was not of any breed they had ever seen. A large crack ran from his neck down to the ground. He was a bluish color, with slight hints of red on his back. His eyes had an eerie red glow to them, and each seemed to shot daggers through their fixation. Behind him were two others. A large, burly Tyrant and a small, dainty Undine. Odd trios yes, but three on three were better odds than Roketh had ever managed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ahh, so your one that lets his lips run before sizing up the competition.&#34; Galin said as he curled each of his four hands into fists. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey, watch it or else I&#39;ll grind you into dust.&#34; The Tyrant spoke slowly, obviously lacking intelligence. <BR> <BR>&#34;Unless you want to be shut up by us, you may want to do it to yourself.&#34; Moonshadow said as he snarled a bit. <BR> <BR>&#34;Careful what you wish for, whisker mutt.&#34; The Undine spoke slowly and voluptuously. <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t think so lady, killing is killing and these are mere babes. If you think you can go toe to toe with us, well let us dance.&#34; Roketh said, he&#39;d been aching to fight for a while, just to relieve the stress of this expedition of finding Kronock. <BR> <BR>The three began pairing off on their own. Moonshadow decided he&#39;d take the Undine, since he was the only speedy one of the group. Galin took the Tyrant, he figured once that guy hit the ground; he&#39;d never get back up. Roketh was plenty content with the leftovers, and leader versus leader was just what he needed. <BR> <BR>The Tyrant was the first to attack. He dove at Galin, and Galin quickly realized that this monster was much more potent than he thought. He was surprisingly fast for a Tyrant. Galin dodged the diving attack and preformed a spinning roundhouse in mid-air. He nailed the Tyrant on the back, forcing the monstrosity to the ground. The beast was quick to his feet, and came up punching, the Tyrant was strong, but so was Galin. They stood toe to toe, slugging each other and blocking in a flurry of punches and kicks. It looked like something from a Jackie Chan movie crossed with Godzilla. The expressions on their faces said plenty about their impressions of the other. They both had a coming facial expression, awe. They were each amazed by the others speed, skill, and power combination. <BR> <BR>Moonshadow and the Undine had stood their ground, in an utter stand off. Each was waiting for the other to make their move. Then, the Undine&#39;s arm became a liquid whip and shot across the clearing, strait for Moonshadow. However, the Tiger/Monol was not so easily taken. Moonshadow quickly dodged to his right. He began powering up, his black fur quickly returning to its glistening, golden radiance that he had discovered. It was a secret to all Terror Hounds, each had it hidden away within them. The Undine was slightly captivated by this, but not for long. She quickly resumed her offensive, shooting liquid blades, whips, maces, spears, and assorted other weapons at her foe with frightening speed. The Tiger was not impressed. With his newfound power and speed, nothing could stop him now. He slowly made progress towards her. Then, he jumped strait in the air and a bright flash engulfed the Undine. When she regained her sight, he was gone. She looked about herself, and then she cast her gaze to the other two bouts. The lines were even, but since her opponent fled, she decided to attack the nearest Dragon, the one contending with her Tyrant friend. She reared back her right hand and formed a harpoon. When she was about to throw it, the golden Tiger appeared in front of her. Not a flash of light, no fancy fireworks, he just appeared. He was indeed that fast when he choose to be. She immediately changed targets and brought her right arm down with full force. A cloud of dust erupted from the earth, and she was temporarily lost in the dust. When the dust subsided, she saw her harpoon arm was impaled into the ground, with no Tiger on it. Then a loud voice rang forth. <BR> <BR>&#34;Lightning blaster!&#34; Moonshadow screamed as his horns charged up and released a large amount of electricity. <BR> <BR>The Undine braced herself as she was hit in the back with the powerful blow. She leaned onto her hand, pushing it deeper into the ground as the energy pushed her on it harder and harder with each passing second. She threw her left hand up and out popped two, small balls of liquid. Moonshadow halted his attack and gazed at the spheres as they fell. The two orbs hit with a slight plop apiece. Moonshadow was slightly puzzled by this attack, but was soon to be shocked, indeed. The liquid balls exploded, and out lunged two children of the Undine. One was best described as a sharkman, with a long, terrifying trident in his left hand. The other orb burst and out jumped something resembling a mutated scorpion. They were both made of water, and they both were fixated on Moonshadow, who prepared to assault. <BR> <BR>The third fight was a little more interesting than the rest. As the others fought a ground war, Roketh was more than just surprised when the Naga sprouted wings and took to the air. What kind of hybrids were these guys anyway? They each possessed traits not usually found in their races. The Naga was amazingly swift as well. Roketh was now flying more evasively than he ever had to before. The Naga rained continuous blasts of energy at him. Energy Shots and Eye Beams tore threw the air, attempting to do the same to Roketh&#39;s flesh. Roketh finally had enough, and he summoned upon his most powerful attack. <BR> <BR>&#34;Demon Flare!&#34; He screamed as he began his trademark move that few could or ever have survived. <BR> <BR>The red, net-like substance covered his mouth. Flame leapt from his maw and began to fill the bag up like a balloon. The ever-expanding film soon formed arms and a face. Then, it detached, being propelled from the stream of fire from the jaws of Roketh. The Naga had little chance to dodge this attack, so he attempted to counter it with his largest and most potent attack. <BR> <BR>&#34;Leopard Cannon!&#34; The Naga wailed as he grasped his chest plate. <BR> <BR>He inserted his fingers in the crack of his chest, the one no one could explain. He pulled as hard as he could, and his chest began to separate. Beams of light began to shot forth from the widening crack. With one, massive pull, the Naga&#39;s chest cavity separated and a huge, white, cat-like beast appeared. The cat itself was black, with white spots all over it. Each spot had a beam of light shining forth. The leopard began racing across the sky, strait for the red demon that was doing the same. When the two collided, an explosion of massive preparations came forth. The explosion knocked both fighters from the air, and every combatant on the ground was knocked over. The two creations of the Undine furiously exploded in a fantastic display of flying water, while the Undine and the Tiger were thrown to the forest. The Tyrant and Galin were each forced to a knee due to the massive force of the explosion. The mere waves of energy that surged of the twisting firestorm were enough to shove each of the fighters either to the ground or to the woods. <BR> <BR>After the explosive force of the combined attacks disappeared, the fighters regained their balance and overall strength and prepared for round two. Will they destroy the entire forest with their battle of the trios? We shall soon see.

 Trust me, this one was quickly thrown together. For circumstances I really don&#39;t want to discus right now, especially on-line. I&#39;ll leave it at my father and I had a slight...disagreement. Any way, anyone following the story I&#39;m sorry about this one.
