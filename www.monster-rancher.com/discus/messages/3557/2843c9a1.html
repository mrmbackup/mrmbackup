M&#39;Lura walked through the rooms swiftly, the train of her midnight-blue dress lightly brushing the floor.  She had lived in this old, dark castle all her life, alone since her father was defeated and sealed up when she was five.  Her black, leathery bat-like wings were folded against her back.  Tonight was her birthday, she had finally seen the summers come and go eighteen times in her life.  The many rings she wore shone in the pale moonlight that streamed through windows she passed on by.  She came to the entrace of the Grand Library and opened the doors, walking into the large room that would easily dwarf a house in itself.  She smiled like a young child getting a present, her love for magic was only equaled by her love of reading.  She took a book from one of the many shelves, she was almost finished with this one.  She sat and crossed her legs, putting one knee over the other as she opened the book.  As she read, she thought a bit about her Father, as she usually did on her birthdays.  Ke&#39;Tok had been evil, a warlock and magician who had let power corrupt him.  The contract with evil he signed in his own blood had promised his next child to them, to be brought up in the ways of darkness.  M&#39;Lura had been that child.  The seed of evil was in her heart, and it showed in her actions.  Yet deep down, she didn&#39;t want to be like this, she wanted to be free..she just didn&#39;t know how.   <BR>Her race itself was evil and dark, it seemed to her.  Once bats, millenia ago, they wanted to be human...they learned to unlock the magic within gems somehow, no one knows how the did it, and became human.  However, there was aspects that differed between the Human and the Batahuman races.  They had wings like a bat on their backs and were able to pick up sounds with their ears much better, even in the supersonic range.   <BR>Which is exactly what she heard now. <BR>M&#39;Lura turned her head at the sound, a sound only she could hear.  It was...calling to her.  She looked around, not being able to pinpoint the location of the noise.  A small point of light caught her eye and she stood up, looking at the light.  It was coming from a certain spot on the bookshelf, from a knot in the wood.  She walked up to it, and not knowing why, she took a delicate, ringed finger and pressed the light. <BR>At the touch, her world was awash in inky blackness. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#34;Cody, wait up!&#34; <BR>Kyria ran to meet with her brother, the small teddy bear she carried in her arms bouncing.   <BR>&#34;Kryia, what are you DOING here?  Go back home, it&#39;s too late for you to be out here anyway!&#34; <BR>Cody placed his rusty-colored furry hand out and pointed back down the path to make his point.  Kyria stamped her foot. <BR>&#34;NO!  I&#39;m NOT going back home, I WANT to know what you&#39;re doing out here in the woods this late at night!&#34; <BR>Cody knew that she would be stubborn and arguing with her would be futile.  He turned his back to her, the cream tip of his tail rustling through the grass. <BR>&#34;FINE then!  Come if you want but don&#39;t cry if something happens!&#34; <BR>Kyria smiled inwardly and walked behind her Foxero brother deeper into the woods.  They were of the Animal Races; walking, talking animals that were frequent in this world, they had lived in peace alongside humans for eons.  <BR>She ran to walk beside him, hugging her teddy bear close.  The only sound in the night were their tails swishing through the grass, the air was clean and crisp in the woods this night, and cold.   <BR>&#34;Cody...&#34; she said quietly. <BR>Cody sighed. &#34;What is it?&#34; <BR>&#34;I..I&#39;m scared..&#34; <BR>&#34;Then why don&#39;t you just head home like I said?!&#34; <BR>&#34;B...because it&#39;s too dark to g-go back myself...a..and..&#34; <BR>Kyria screamed as the bush near her rustled loudly and she grabbed onto Cody suddenly, effectively scaring him out of his wits in the process. <BR>&#34;AHHHHH!!....KYRIA, WHAT ARE YOU DO-&#34; <BR>He was cut off by his little sister&#39;s hyterics.. <BR>&#34;THERE! IN THE BUSH IT MOVED YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING I KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING THERE!&#34; <BR>Cody looked at the bush as a rabbit hopped from it and across the grass.   <BR>&#34;....&#34; <BR>Kyria looked at the bunny. <BR>&#34;Oh how CUTE.&#34; <BR>Cody more or less threw her off of his body.  She fell on her rear, almost bruising her tail. <BR>&#34;Oooowwwww~~~!&#34; <BR>&#34;Get up already and come ON, I&#39;m gonna be late.&#34; <BR>Cody started walking away through the forest. <BR>&#34;You big JERK!....my tail...&#34; <BR>Kyria got up and ran after Cody, calling for him to wait up. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>M&#39;Lura awoke with a splitting headache and her equilibrium was off by a mile. <BR>&#34;Ughnn..&#34; <BR>She placed a hand to her temple, not knowing when the pain would subside but hoping it was soon.  As she looked around, she had no idea where she was.  The room she was in was small, about five feet long and five feet wide.  A dark hallway was before her, leading to God-knows-where.  She waited until her head stopped spinning and the pain subsided before standing.  Un-lit torches lined the walls, the only light coming from the torch on the wall near her.  She reached for it and tried to take it from the wall, it didn&#39;t move. <BR>M&#39;Lura tried a teleportation spell.  Nothing.  Things weren&#39;t looking great for her at all, she had no idea what to do.  She started walking down the hallway, and jumped back as the unlit torch from before sparked to life as she got close. <BR><I>&#34;So that&#39;s how it is..&#34;</I> <BR>She made her way down the stone hall, looking about her.  The ceiling was made of dirt and roots, she assumed she was underground; the earthy smell of the dirt filled her nostrils, it slightly calmed her nerves.  Her sharp ears heard water running somewhere down here, not quite sure where.  Down the corridor, she saw a faint whiteish-blue glow, she quickened her pace.  She entered another room, and she gasped at the sight before her.. <BR><I>&#34;Where am I..&#34;</I> <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Cody and Kyria reached a cave within the Berekia Mountains, several others were waiting. <BR>&#34;There you are!  Finally!&#34; Quelian exclaimed.  The young LunarWolf&#39;s tail was wagging in anticipation and excitement, he couldn&#39;t wait.   <BR>&#34;What is SHE doing here?&#34; <BR>Quelian pointed to Kyria with a furred finger, his claw pointing at her face.  Cody sighed. <BR>&#34;She followed me.  Now what did you guys find in here that&#39;s so important and cool?&#34; <BR>Bethany spoke up; a young human of fifteen years, she had been friends with the others for many years.  They were all the same age, grew up together, and played together.  Considered a tomboy, she was always the first to take new risks and try new things, especially if they were dangerous.  She wasn&#39;t without her lady-like qualities, however, and had quite a few admirers. <BR>&#34;You have to see this, guys.  Come on.&#34; <BR>Bethany walked into the cave, the others following close behind.  Kyria held Cody&#39;s hand tight, clutching her stuffed bear to her chest.  The dark cave smelled funny, she didn&#39;t like it.  They walked in darkness for many minutes, coming to the end of the cave.  Runed were etched and carved into the stone, with gems scattered throughout the rock.  Diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires, citrines..they were plentiful. <BR>&#34;WOAH!&#34; Cody exclaimed.  &#34;Look at all the jewels!  I bet selling just ONE will make us rich!  Come on!&#34; <BR>Bethany smiled.  &#34;You have the same idea as I do..&#34; <BR>The three teenagers started gathering gems, Kyria watched with the interest of a young child, not caring about monetary value.  The gems were pretty and shiny, that&#39;s what caught her attention.  Quelian grew uneasy.. <BR>&#34;If this cave has been here for so long...why hasn&#39;t anyone come to get the gems?..&#34; <BR>Bethany took a diamond from the wall. <BR>&#34;Who CARES!  Let&#39;s finish up here and bolt.&#34; <BR>Pockets full of gems, the children were about to leave when a large diamond caught Kyria&#39;s eye.  She approached it.  The rock had to be at <I>least</I> 50 carats. <BR>&#34;Oooh..&#34; <BR>Cody looked at the diamond with greedy hunger in his hazel eyes. <BR>&#34;I&#39;m claiming this one!&#34; <BR>He reached out, took hold of it, and started to pull. <BR>&#34;URGH!  It isn&#39;t budging!&#34; <BR>Kyria walked up to him, as did Bethany and Quelian.  They all started to pull. <BR>&#34;This SUCKS!&#34; Quelian said.  &#34;Let&#39;s just..&#34; <BR>The gem popped out. <BR>&#34;Got it!&#34; Cody said.  &#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34; <BR>The room started to shake as Cody finished his sentence. <BR>&#34;What&#39;s going on?!&#34; <BR>The floor under them caved in without warning, causing the party of young kids down to land in a pile of bones that broke their fall.  They all rolled off the gruesome hill of decay to the floor. <BR>&#34;Ugh...everyone alright?&#34; Bethany asked. <BR>The others looked up at her. <BR>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m alright.&#34; Cody reported.  &#34;Quelian?..&#34; <BR>Silence was the answer that replied, Kyria was walking backwards until she bumped into Cody.  She was shaking, clutching her doll. <BR>&#34;Kyria?  What&#39;s..&#34; <BR>Bethany screamed, pointing in front of them.  Cody looked ahead and his eyes widened.  Quelian was impaled on a large metal spike, run right through his back and protruding out his chest.  His face was frozen in pain and fear in death, blood trailing down the spike that impaled him.  Bethany was crying, as was Kyria. <BR>&#34;Oh God...oh God...what...&#34;  Bethany said between sobs.  Cody hug his arms around her, she cried into his furred chest.  He was close to tears himself.  Kyria hug onto his leg.  <BR>&#34;I wanna go home big Brother!  Please!&#34; <BR>Cody looked down at her, and placed a hand onto her head comfortingly. <BR>&#34;Y-yeah, alright.  Come on Beth..&#34; <BR>Cody looked around, and saw a passageway.  He started leading the two down the hall, an arm around Bethany&#39;s shoulders to help her walk, Kyria at his side.  They came upon a room that had a glow coming from the doorway.  They walked in and froze at the sight before them. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>M&#39;Lura walked forward to the object that was making the light.  A large crystal, as high as four men and just as wide, was glowing upon a pedistal.  Within was a figure dressed in black robes around his body, a black cape behind him.  A pair of large, leathery wings were open behind him. <BR><I>&#34;Father?..&#34;</I> <BR>M&#39;Lura walked forward, reaching out to touch the crystal.  As soon as the skin of her fingers touched the crystal, cracks appeared, making a spiderweb-like design through the crystal. <BR>M&#39;Lura gasped...as well as did another voice.  She turned around to see Cody, Bethany, and Kyria.  M&#39;Lura turned at the sound of a loud shattering, and fell over as a large black form raced past her toward the children. <BR>&#34;No!..&#34; M&#39;Lura yelled, but it was too late. <BR>Bethany screamed, the sound dying in her throat.  A sick crunch echoed through the room, Cody fell limp to the floor...and a small brown teddy bear, with black buttons for eyes, fell into a growing pool of blood on the floor, never to be held again by loving and caring hands.

 Great story! I&#39;m already in love with the M&#39;Lura character. Again, the title&#39;s a little too complicated, but ,overall, I give it an A. Good Job!
