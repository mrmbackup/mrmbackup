Ode to Nagas &#40;Sung to the tune of &#34;It&#39;s a Jolly Holiday with Mary&#34; from Mary Poppins&#41; Lyrics by Lao  <BR> <BR>Oh every monster rancher needs a Naga! Nagas make the ranch feel right! When you&#39;re not living up to all the sagas, A Naga makes you see the light!  <BR> <BR>So what they tend to mutilate their dummies? At least they&#39;re busy not drawing your blood! &#42;scrape&#42;scrape&#42;  <BR> <BR>The Naga&#39;s nails are sharp! He&#39;s mean at heart! He makes the monsters run before fights start, Oh! Every monster rancher needs a Naga! No wonder that it&#39;s Nagas that we love!  <BR> <BR>Oh every monster rancher needs a Naga! The Nagas earn you tons of G! When other breeds are making you go gaga, A Naga makes your heart cry Whee!!!  <BR> <BR>So what if they&#39;re not suited well to outings? They&#39;re dumb as rocks but still they&#39;re worth your love! &#42;heartbeat&#42;heartbeat&#42;  <BR> <BR>Yes, their claws are sharp! And they&#39;re mean at heart! They love to rip their toys and foes apart, Oh! Every monster rancher needs a Naga! Just treat &#39;em right or they will want your blood! Just treat &#39;em right or they will want your blood!  <BR> <BR>-- Lao &#40;<A HREF="mailto:darklao@hotmail.com">darklao@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, December 02, 1999  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>That was histerical! I loved it. &#40;All the rest of the people in the studio are looking at me strangely because I just had to sing it out loud. But that&#39;s not too bad. When I get too wierd, they tend to bring me large amounts of chocolate and try to drug me into submission. ^_^&#41;  <BR> <BR>-Berge  <BR> <BR>-- Berge &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rellis@bigidea.com">rellis@bigidea.com</A>&#41;, December 02, 1999.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Thanks, Lao... that was really cool :&#41; You may have inspired me to write songs about monsters... let&#39;s see, what rhymes with Colorpandora?
