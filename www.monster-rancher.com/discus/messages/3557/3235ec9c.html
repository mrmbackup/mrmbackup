<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF='mailto:seliah@guildworld.com'>Seliah du'Kasi Shr'Lan</A></B> on <B>Sunday, February 18, 2001 - 04:31 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 Prologue <BR> <BR> <BR>She stood above the freshly packed earth, and sang softly, trying to calm down. He was dead…her father was gone from this life forever…and her own healing energies had not been able to save him… Her silver wings drooping visibly, shining blood red as the setting sun bounces its rays of light off of them, and her white hair that hangs to her hips flows down over her right shoulder, the rest going down her back in waves of snow. <BR>She was half-Faery and half-Human…an outcast, by most standards, and abandoned, left to die as an infant. Her name was Seliah du’Kasi Shr’Lan…and she was the adopted daughter of the wandering bard Khelan du’Kasi. The grave was Khelan’s and the fault was hers…or so she believed. <BR> <BR>Shaking, tears flowing, she sang desperately, the song meant for calming and peace, it’s melody soft, her voice trembling, the notes flowing, rising and falling in a minor key... And where music had always helped her before…she found that in this case, her spellsong only further reminded her of her loss…for Khelan had taught her music, and how to blend her spells and music together into spellsong. As she stands there singing, the sun sets fully, and she continues singing on thru the night, as alone in her position in the forest as she was in her heart. <BR> <BR>It was too much, really, for her to handle. She was only 16, having just reached maturity, and now she was burying the only man in the world that had ever cared for her…about her….at all. As the last of the day’s light fades, she sits down on the ground, wrapping her silver feathery wings around her tightly, crying bitterly. <BR> <BR>In her mind, she believed the fault to be hers, that Khelan lay dead. The mage he had gotten her to help teach her to control her abilities had turned out to be perhaps the biggest mistake either of them had ever made… <BR> <BR>“You have these talents, Seliah, because Vaislah has granted them to you…you must learn how to control them, and use them, for the greater good. To ignore them, and apologize and pay for damages they cause due to lack of training is a slight against Vaislah, and against Her angels, who watch over us.” Khelan had always said. <BR> <BR>And so, the bard had found a mage to teach her how to control her talents. She was Fire Elemental…and the Fires burned forever within her…and always would until the day they ran cold as her soul left her body. For two years, she had studied, worked, and learned under the mage. Under Zerin Quital…a name that would only sit in her mind now connected to grief, pain, regret, anger, and hatred. <BR> <BR>At the end of those two years, he had decided that he wanted more from her than just to teach her. Zerin had approached Khelan, and asked for her in marriage. The bard had refused, feeling that there was something about this man that warranted caution, and distrust. As Seliah thought on it now, she began to realize that Khelan had never fully trusted the mage. Had, in fact, made numerous references and statements to her that she must always be watchful, even from those close to her. <BR> <BR>Zerin had gone away peacefully enough when Khelan had refused his offer, but within two weeks of the refusal, he had attacked the girl,and tried to kidnap her. She had fought him, but he had simply cast a spell that restrained her magic, and at only five feet tall, she was no match in a physical fight against the six foot five Zerin.  <BR>Khelan had been too far away to get there before he had finished enjoying her, but he arrived as Zerin had begun to bind her limbs. <BR> <BR>Fully in a rage, Khelan had drawn his staff from behind him and attacked the mage. He managed to drive the man from their home in the forest, but he did not kill him. When death was drawing near, Zerin had spoken a few words—his spell, and teleported out. <BR> <BR>As soon as the mage had left, Khelan threw his staff to the side, and knelt down beside Seliah, who was bleeding from numerous cuts and wounds, and was barely conscious. Khelan threw a blanket over her to cover her, and rushed her to one of the faery villages to a healer. While in the healer’s care, the bard left her, and disappeared for a full week. Seliah, thinking that he had abandoned her because of what the mage had done, went into a full scale depression, not even her music being able to lift her spirits. <BR> <BR>Khelan returned, however, and slowly began to die. Seliah could not heal him, nor could any healer that she brought him too. He just began to slowly waste away, not eating, not sleeping…but that which really clued her in was when he stopped singing. For Khelan always had a smile and a song upon his lips…and to see him give up even the will to sing, Seliah knew for sure then, that he was dying. <BR> <BR>She knew full well, though, that the bard had gone to hunt down the mage. And it was her belief that the mage had cast some kind of spell on Khelan. Therefore, in her opinion, Khelan now lay dead because of her…however indirectly; he would not have gone after Zerin had she been able to ward him off in the first place. <BR> <BR>As daylight began threading its way through the dense Shr’Lan forest, the faery gains her feet, and turns her back on the grave, her eyes and wings as blood red as the rising sun, above the treetops behind her, small flames licking at the edge of her wings…

Thanks, Torey. This is the first real novel I&#39;ve worked on. &#40;&#40;I have a Star Trek one going as well, but it&#39;s kind of stalled with a major case of writer&#39;s block on that one. &#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>I posted it for the heck of it, really.  Any comments or critisizms I can get are helpful, since I&#39;m not in a position where I can get feedback on it from too many offline. <BR> <BR>Thanks again.
