 Heh heh.  :D  Alot of you all don&#39;t know me, but I joined a couple weeks ago.  Unfortunately, my computer messed up, and I wasn&#39;t able to get on for a while.   <BR>I like to write, draw, and do other creative stuff also,  and I plan to be spending alot of the summer here with you all.  :D  Oh, and please tell me how you think I did.  Thank You. <BR> <BR>---------------------------- <BR> <BR>It is a time where breeders have found a way to &#34;capture&#34;  wild monsters in Saucer Stones.  Monsters, fearing for their freedom created a new island south of Togle, small, but large enough to fit all types of monsters.  This island that the monsters called New Togle, is hidden from Breeders, helping all monsters to achieve peace with each other.   <BR> <BR>Monsters also, learned that gadgets don&#39;t need to be used to help them power up, they use a method that was used a long time ago, using the power of nature to strengthen.   <BR> <BR>This story begins in a cave of New Togle, where unbeknownst to Thousands, either destruction or salvation would come to New Togle and all of the land. <BR> <BR>------------- <BR> <BR>The cry of two baby Antlans could be heard throughout the whole floor of the cave.  No monster dared to see who it was, because they feared that they would be obligated to take responsibility for them.  The two Antlans, tired and hungry, lay crying for hours. <BR> <BR>A Raiden passing by, who was himself searching for food happened to noticed the two babies.  He looked around for their parents, but saw no one.  He searched everywhere and that floor, and on every other floor&#40;which took him a while because that particular cave had 12 floors&#41;, but found no antlans, just mostly Plants and Koropendoras.  He returned to the second floor where he found the Antlans, who were crying, but not as loudly as before.  &#34;Well, I guess I&#39;ll be taking you two with me then,&#34; he said, feeling sorry for the abandoned babies.  He picked up one, and tried to pick up the other, but he dropped the second, who started yelling and kicking louder than ever.  &#34;Sorry!&#34; he said, as he made another attempt to pick up the child, but the same incident was repeated.  The Antlan continued to kick and scream as the Raiden patted it on it&#39;s head.  &#34;I&#39;ll come back for you soon, alright,&#34; he said to the Antlan as he went on his way to his village with the other Antlan.  <BR> <BR> <BR>A Zan staggered his way through the same cave, after being maliciously beaten by his tribe for attacking the leader and declaring he would destroy the world.  Now, after being abandoned by the only place he felt love, he held on to the wall while trying to find a nice place to sit down.  He came to an empty room where a baby Antlan lay, staring at the cieling.  He continued on his way, not paying the baby any attention.  He reached the entrance into the next room, when a vile, sinister thought popped into his head.  He would train the Antlan until it was stronger than all monsters in the world, then he would use him to destroy all of the land and become ruler, or he would just eat him with a glass of carrot juice.  He shook his head at how silly the second thought was, then wen&#39;t over to the Antlan and picked it up, causing it to stop crying, then he continued deeper and deeper into the cave, thinking and rethinking his plan.

 Allowing to the fact that many of our members have seemingly dropped off the face of the earth, including me, I might as well give you some helpful tips that everyone, including me, should follow. <BR> <BR>First off, you have many of the same problems almost all the authors here have or have had. <BR> <BR>1.&#41;Length. Your chapters must be longer to actually qualify as an epic. This point of duscussion is continually repeated throughout this library. <BR> <BR>2.&#41;Grammar. Your use of commas, as well as your general diction, lacks proper usage. For example, &#34;Monsters also, learned that gadgets don&#39;t need to be used to help them power up, they use a method that was used a long time ago, using the power of nature to strengthen. &#34; I believe this should be, &#34;The monsters on the island did not use gadgets to power up. Instead, they used the raw energy found in nature to strengthen themselves.&#34; <BR> <BR>3.&#41; The point made above also serves as a precursor. Your sentences need more detail, more word imagery.  <BR> <BR>4.&#41; This is a mistake I make myself. When you have the need to describe something new, you do so in the later half of the sentence, after the clause in which you needed that description. For example, &#34;A Zan staggered his way through the same cave, after being maliciously beaten by his tribe for attacking the leader and declaring he would destroy the world.&#34; The previous scene in which the zan made this declaration and was beaten should have been described in full detail beforehand. Instead, it was made into an afterthought. If this scene was told of and described before, then there would be no need to describe why the zan was staggering. actions should be described in the order in which they happen. This creates a more natural flow to the overall passage.
