<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF='mailto:Richard@absalom.c.o.uk'>GARLANT</A></B> on <B>Tuesday, November 13, 2001 - 03:32 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 There is a room.  The room is the only dark place in a palace of white.  The palace is not palace shaped but egg shaped and underground.  It is bright silver and has electricity running around its surface.  The room contains a thrown with deep curved arm rails. The man sitting there has a wispy grey beard, yellow tinted goggles and a leather jacket.  On his back is a sword holder and inside it is a thin, long samurai sword.  His name is Detanarcnier.  He is sitting still and staring through the room at a large door.  It opens and footsteps clip through the room.  <BR> <BR>A brown bolt shot through the sky and nose dived at the ground.  A ball of pink was jumping side-to-side and waving three long stems around as it moved. Destiny&#39;s wings folded into his body and he fell with even greater speed.  He landed on top of the plant and it went flying.  Destiny turned quickly and his horn began to glow slightly.  There was a shot of light and he was instantly at the plants bedraggled body.  The plant went flying once more and hit the ground metres away.  It struggled to get up then fell and its stems drooped.  Destiny walked over to it and then waved its arms in the air.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you ok Felo?&#34; A hippy like girl asked slowly. <BR> <BR>The plant slowly waved a droopy stem and tried again to get up. It propped itself up with a leaf then its roots straightened.  It walked over to its master and looked unhappily at her. <BR> <BR>&#34;No problem Felo, well win the next one.&#34; <BR> <BR>Lisa smiled at a hardly worn out Destiny and patted its back.  Destiny smiled then walked over to where Fierce and Bolt were playing with rocks.  Kain and Zack had watched the battle and were smiling.  The trainers watched their monsters playing like mothers watch kids in a playground.  The kids are vaguely aware they are being watched but don&#39;t seem to care.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Their getting real strong you know.&#34;  Said Zack. <BR> <BR>Lisa made an um noise that signified yes.  Kain just watched Bolt push a tiny rock along the ground.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Are either of yours above E level?&#34; Lisa asked.  Kain and Zack suddenly both clicked something.  They had never entered an official tourney with Fierce or Bolt.  Lisa smiled as they looked at each other, <BR> <BR>&#34;No Destiny is not either but the ideal chance may be coming up.&#34; <BR> <BR>She dug into her blue rucksack and fished out a thin magazine.  It was colourful and did not look cheap.  She held it up to them so that they could see the front cover.  The magazines title was &#34;Monster fever&#34;.  It had a picture of a bright yellow suezo slamming his tongue against a curled up moochi. The photo seemed to have been taken a stadium and the words, &#34;Run through tourney&#34; were displayed just above in slightly smaller writing than the title.  Lisa quickly flicked through the magasine, stopped, turned a couple of pages back and then said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Look at this.&#34; <BR> <BR>There were several pictures of battling monsters and people.  Kain took the magazine and read it aloud. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fans of the Official tournaments will be happy to hear there is a new official tourney about.  The run through tourney will be held only every two years and will take place instead of the regular June official.  The run through tourney will work in exactly the same fashion as the official ones but trainers will be able to enter monsters in higher levels.  The leagues will be cut down to only two monsters per table and then once you have one that league you can enter the class above.  This means trainers do not have to wait three months between official tournaments.&#34; <BR> <BR>That&#39;s amazing though Kain.  Zack looked at him and asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;Where&#39;s the tournament?&#34; <BR> <BR>Kain scanned the page then stopped. <BR> <BR>&#34;Any official league ground.&#34; <BR> <BR>Lisa beamed.  <BR> <BR>&#34;The first tournament is in two days time and the town down the valley has a stadium&#34; <BR> <BR>She pointed to a large arena in the valley below them and she smiled.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Lets enter it, think how good it would be if we all made master trainers.  Word is that there is a surprise fore the strongest monster.&#34; <BR> <BR>The trainers slowly made there way down to the small village and waited for the night to draw in.  Zack and Kain could not understand how they had never noticed something was up.  Nearly every single person in the hotel had a monster with him or her.  The next day was mostly spent training.  Destiny was carrying big bags of sand with several other beaclon, Fierce was viciously cutting fruit from the kitchen and Bolt was pummelling a punch bag. As the afternoon came about the monsters rested and the trainers also decided to get an early night in.  There sleep was strangely undisturbed but Kain was feeling extremely nervous when he woke up. Light was flooding through the gap in the curtains and making a bright light in the other wise shaded room.   <BR> <BR>The arena was totally full when they got there.  People were streaming in from all angels and collecting at the ticket booths.  One set of booths had &#34;spectators&#34; above it and one had &#34;Entries&#34;.  The one-marked entries was a lot less cramped and all three trainers headed for it.  The women behind the window smiled pleasantly at them and pushed three pieces of paper forward.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Fill these in please, you may now enter.&#34;  <BR> <BR>The turnstile clicked and the three trainers and their monsters walked in.  The locker room was huge.  Monsters and trainers filled its benches.  Some were talking, others laughing and joking and some were stretching.  Kain stared at his sheet and realised the other two had filled theirs in all ready.  He ticked the boxes and looked to Bolt.  There was a click. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hello, hello can we please have quiet? Thank you.  This tournament is the first of its kind.  You will each be given a partner to fight at E class.  Half the trainers here will be knocked out.  Then a partner at D class and another half will be knocked out.  Slowly you will move up the league, battling your partner.  When you reach beat S class there will be sixteen competitors left.  They will fight in tables of six with only the top trainer going through.  When there are only four monsters left they will fight each other and the winner will get their surprise.  Now please hand in your forms and we shall select your partners.  Several men wearing strapped on boxes walked around slipping forms into the boxes and when each person had handed in their registry form they left the locker room. Zack looked around the room at all the different monsters.  About an hour later the man with the megaphone returned to the room and shouted. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok you are free to leave the arena as soon as you are given a time sheet.  It lists the times of all your matches.  You must be on time or you wall automatically lose.  Thank you.&#34;   <BR> <BR>The men with boxes returned but this time handed out slips of paper to each trainer.  Kain, Lisa and Zack&#39;s matches were fairly close together and all that afternoon. <BR> <BR>They left the arena and walked back to the hotel where they had a large lunch.  The team were ready for their first ever-official tournaments with there current monsters.  Zack and Fierce were up first.  Zack walked into the locker room marked A band. Fierce walked through a room of several trainers on to the field and the screaming of the crowd hit him.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Remember that scream? You were Houndine in those days.&#34; <BR> <BR>Fierce nodded and bounced about. At the other end of the field the second trainer entered with his monster.  The monsters stared at each other. The other looked like Fierce but a statue.  It was a giant rock duck.  Zack noticed a huge screen running across the whole west side of the stadium, the East side had a similar screen.  The screens lit up and displayed a picture of the arena.  A whistle blew and the fight began. <BR> <BR>&#34;This should be easy Fierce, these guys are just E class.&#34; <BR> <BR>Fierce bobbed on his legs happily as the grey creature slowly walked up to the centre of the arena. Fierce leapt forward much quicker and went to slap it with his wings.  The blocken swung his huge flippers at Fierce and before Fierce could get a shot in he was sent flying.  Zack jumped, flutter slap shouldn&#39;t be that strong.  The enemy trainer laughed from across the pitch. <BR> <BR>&#34;At the expense of some speed and intelligence, blocken gets a massive stat boost in power.&#34; <BR> <BR>Fierce was ducking and dodging the blockens attacks with ease but they were very strong.  Fierce glared at it and rolled into a ball.  He flew at the blocken and bounced off.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Use intelligence attacks Fierce!&#34;  Zack shouted. <BR> <BR>Fierce turned, nodded then leapt back.  His eyes glowed read and fired a bright red beam at the blockens head.  The blocken fell back to the floor and got back up.  Zack grimaced, this could be hard.  The two monsters had got into a slapping fight, first the blocken then Fierce mindlessly swinging its flippers, not gaining a single hit.  Zack knew he had to get a combo in.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Fierce, Duck!&#34; <BR> <BR>Fierce ducked quickly under the rock wing and jumped up in front of the unready blocken.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Combo it!&#34;  Zack shouted hopefully. <BR> <BR>Fierce slapped him powerfully round the face, stepped back and his head grew to maybe three times its normal size.  The blocken stumbled back.  There was a gasp from the audience.  Fierce pulled in his arms, legs and head, and rolled at the giant rock, he hit it powerfully and the blocken fell to the floor.  Fierce saw his chance.  He leapt forward and landed on the rock stomach.  There was a blast of red light and Fierce flew into the air supported by a beam aimed at the floor.  The smoke cleared and the blocken lay still.  The whistle blew and Fierce danced happily then ran up to Zack. <BR> <BR>&#34;Nice one Fierce!&#34; Zack shouted as they walked back with the speakers announcing Fierce&#39;s win.            <BR> <BR>Lisa was up next.  Destiny was eating a chunk of meat from the bone.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Be careful Lisa.&#34; Zack warned. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why should I be careful of a few E class weaklings?&#34;  She laughed and Destiny flexed his arms.   <BR> <BR>&#34;You think we are the only trainers to enter, remember half the people here can easily beat E class.  This is pretty much a free for all until we reach C class.&#34;  Zack warned. <BR> <BR>The arena had been re-sanded by the time Lisa and Destiny walked up the path to her trainer box. Destiny flexed his arms again and looked across the field.  An elderly man was standing in the opposition box wearing a long gown.  His monster was a suezo, purple in colour and it seemed to be much more violent.  Lisa guessed there was probably the vicious blood of a Naga in it.  The suezo looked evilly at the giant mass of Destiny.   <BR>The whistle blew a shrill note. <BR> <BR>The suezo did not move. It did not even bounce or blink.  It eyed the giant beetle evilly and stood frozen. Lisa watched it. Destiny waited and then lunged forward with his horn.  There was a flash of blue light and the suezo was gone, it reappeared behind Destiny and swung its tail into his back.  Destiny stepped forward to balance then turned and lunged again. The suezo was once again gone and at least five metres away. Destiny&#39;s horn began to glow violently and a beam shot forward and blasted the suezo into the air. It bit onto its tail and span straight at Destiny.  Destiny fell to the floor and stumbled to get up.  The spinning wheel ran round in a circle and hit him again.  Destiny sagged.  The whistle blew and Destiny crawled up to a smiling Lisa.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t worry Destiny, he could easily have beat A class.&#34;  She said. <BR> <BR>They crawled to the changing rooms and Kain was only two matches away.  He was pretty psyched up.  Bolt was punching invisible enemies and leaping around. Kain looked at him and smiled.  Bolt was getting stronger every day.   <BR> <BR>The whistle blew and Bolt looked up.  The enemy monster was a bright white wall.  It&#39;s sides were a darker cream but still light.  It floated in the air and somehow managed to look menacing without a face.  It leapt back in a huge jump and there was a flash.  A multi coloured light beam shot through the air at Bolt.  Bolt crossed his claws and deflected the energy of the beam around his arms.  The ivory wall floated there innocently.  Bolt opened his claws and fired bolts of green light randomly at the monol.  The wall fell to the ground and re-gathered swooping upwards.  It dropped face first straight at Bolt, who jumped back and caught it in his claws. Kain smiled as Bolt looked to him with the struggling monol held helplessly in his claws. <BR> <BR>&#34;Smash him up good!&#34;  Kain shouted. <BR> <BR>Bolt threw his claws downwards and the monol hit the ground.  His pincers angled upwards again and then threw him back down to the floor.  This repeated until Bolt jumped a little and let go.  The monol broke into pieces and lay unconscious.  Medics ran on to the field as the whistle blew and Bolt and Kain both punched the air.   <BR> <BR>Back at the hotel Lisa congratulated the other two.  She did not seem at all upset but really excited for the other two.  She handed Kain and Zack separate bits of paper. <BR> <BR>&#34;The secretary gave me these schedules for you.  The winner of the match you were in.&#34; She pointed to Zack. <BR> <BR>&#34;Is against the winner of match 14.  No idea who that is, at 9:00 tomorrow.  Kain your up against the winner of match 3, yet again I have no idea at 15:00.&#34;  The D class is still pretty broad, there will be a few easy trainers left who got lucky draws at the beginning.&#34;   <BR> <BR>Kain nodded.  D class was considered the last beginner class for a monster to be in.  He was looking forward to competing.  Zack was not nervous either.  He wondered who his opponent for the next match would be as he settled in his hotel room bed listening to Fierce talk in his sleep.   <BR> <BR>The whistle rang through the stadium.  A long yellow snake like creature was slithering in front of Fierce.  It single eye shone brightly as it swung its long, whip like tail through the air at Fierce.  Fierce jumped it with ease and thrust his expanded head at the cyclops. It fell to the floor then stabbed at him with sharp claws.  As fierce flew backwards he somersaulted and fired a boomerang of body parts at the monster.  It fell to the floor and did not get up.  Fierce danced happily to the cheer of the crowd. <BR> <BR>Bolt looked tired.  The battle had lasted three minutes and both him and the giant frozen blob on the other side of the stadium had been giving out full pelt attacks.  Bolt shook his whole body and leapt forward claws first.  The blue and white ball of mucus sidled sideways and tried to slam his palms on to Bolt.  There was a crash but Bolt had jumped out the way and thrust his stinger into the blob.  It went limp around the lance and the whistle blew. <BR> <BR>Lisa looked really happy when the two of them got back to the hotel.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you come along and watch?&#34; Asked Kain. <BR> <BR>&#34;We did great!&#34; happily laughed Zack. <BR> <BR>&#34;I know! They have been broadcasting the matches on TV. live!&#34;  Lisa pointed to the screen.  Two monsters were leaping around with a small red banner in the top left hand corner saying &#34;live&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#34;I got a sheet with the rest of the match times on.  You both one your matches so I think Kain has his next one at 14:00 and Zack yours is at erm... 15:00.  Oh my goodness, Kain your up against that purple suezo that beat Destiny.&#34;  Lisa looked up and smiled evilly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Kick his butt!&#34; She snarled. <BR> <BR>The rest of the day was spent resting. The monsters needed to have a lot of rest if they were to be battling for five days.  The time went surprisingly quickly and within what seemed minutes of waking up Kain walked into the stadium to the sound of cheering.  His opponent was already in the trainer box and was wearing the same long gown.  The purple suezo looked just as menacing and evil as he had been against Destiny and Kain could not help but feel a little scared when the whistle blew.  He watched as neither monster moved.  Jestingly Bolt threw his fist forward and just as Kain had expected he teleported to safety.  Kain smiled.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok Bolt, do it!&#34;  Kain&#39;s voice rang through the roar of the crowed to Bolt and he nodded. <BR> <BR>The suezo was teleporting around aimlessly trying to coax Bolt into attacking and thus leaving a week spot behind him.  Bolt punched then ducked quickly, covering his head with his pincers.  Just as Kain had suspected the suezo was behind Bolt and his tail whipped pointlessly against Bolt&#39;s strong claws.  Bolt&#39;s stinger fired like a bolt of lightning, three times and the suezo fell to the floor.  Surprise can be a monsters greatest weapon. <BR> <BR>Zack had a fight only an hour later and Kain walked back to the hotel to watch it on TV. with Lisa.  When he walked in Lisa jumped up and beamed at him. <BR> <BR>&#34;Nice one Kain! That taught the little cyclops.&#34; <BR> <BR>Zack and Fierce were waiting for the opponent to arrive when they heard a nasty roar from the batch B changing rooms.  When the monster entered the arena it was a small spot saurian.  It looked peaceful and Zack wondered how such a nice looking monster could sound so violent.  The lizard scratched the sand with his claws as he waited for the whistle. Fierce looked angrily at him and smiled nastily.   <BR> <BR>As the whistle sounded the lizard dove straight in with his claws.  Fierce was unready and just dodged the slashing blades.  As he over balanced from turning the spot saurian dived and knocked the wooden duck flying. Fierce climbed to his feet and quacked angrily.  The saurian did not stop to breath and leapt again.  Fierce easily dodged it this time and fired a laser of ruby light at the flying lizard.  He landed badly and Fierce reacted quickly.  There was a slashing noise as a boomerang attack cut the peaceful looking zoom across the arms.  Blood slowly seeped from both sides and the zuum let out a slow whine.  The duckens head was getting larger and a ball travelled up his neck, his beak opened and a bright green missile fired at the brown dinosaur.  There was an explosion and the whistle blew. <BR> <BR>Kain clapped as he saw the smoke clear on TV. and heard the whistle blow. Lisa quickly traced along the schedule sheet.  That means he is up against a hopper of some type next I think, I can&#39;t remember exactly what type, possibly a fairy hopper.  <BR> <BR>They decided to celebrate that night and ate a large meal.  Both Kain and Zack had made it to B class.  They were finding it less and less worrying the further they got in the tournament.  Both Kain and Zack slept peacefully that night.   <BR> <BR>Zack had his match first the next day.  Fierce swallowed some green nut oils quickly before the tournament and then ran onto the field followed closely by his trainer.  Zack had become use to the cheer of the crowd and he had heard that both him and Kain were associated with exciting matches.  The enemy monster was not a fairy hopper but a weird and extremely ugly hopper.  It had a flat beak and looked like a strange malformed duck billed platypus.  It had slimy pink skin and green ears.  It looked blankly at Fierce who stared back. <BR> <BR>The whistle blew to start the match and the crowd began to cheer.  The pink ugly hopper jumped forward in little summersaults until it was level with Fierce and then punched him hard.  Fierce had not been expecting such a strong punch and fell to the floor.  Fierce felt embarrassed and stood up again.  The crowd were growing quieter as Fierce launched his beak at the monster.  It missed by miles as the little critter jumped easily over it.  Fierce looked around and tried again, this time striking a bit faster.  The hopper leaped over the attack effortlessly and punched Fierce back to the floor.  Fierce went nuts, he dove forward desperately trying to stab the hopper with his beak or slap him with his wings.  He slowly collapsed, tired.  The pink critter jumped next to him and flicked his wrist several times, quickly.  Fierces eyes closed and the whistle blew.  Kain shouted at the TV. And Zack smiled brightly but still looked a little disappointed.   <BR> <BR>Kain smiled sadly at Zack when he entered the hotel room.  Fierce looked better than he had done and went over to Destiny and Bolt.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Bad luck Zack.&#34; Lisa said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Its ok, we still got Kain in there.  How long till your match?&#34;  He said upbeat. <BR> <BR>&#34;Eh, Half an hour.  I&#39;m just leaving.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kain clicked his fingers and Bolt bounded up to him and they left the hotel.  He had worked out his next match, a scaled worm.  It had beaten a nasty opponent in its last round and he was a little worried about Bolt&#39;s chances. <BR> <BR>The whistle blew and the green worm jumped back a little as did Bolt.  It had a nasty looking trainer and looked pretty mean itself.  Maybe it was just him but Kain was sure its tusks looked bigger than usual. It drove its mouth forward and tried to bite in to Bolt&#39;s side.  He quickly threw his pincers in the way and the bite was reflected off painfully.  The scaled worm stopped moving suddenly and began to shake.  Bolt wondered d what was happening and leapt forward with his pincers open for a claw assault.  There was a ripping noise as the worm&#39;s legs extended to full length and it ran speedily away from the assault.  It was such a clever tactic; Kain had never seen a trainer pull it off in such a high level tournament.  It usually took a lot longer to do and left them very venerable.  The worm spiralled around in a U-turn and charged with its head down towards Bolt.  Bolt went flying upwards and fired a few rounds of energy shots. A couple hit but most sizzled into the ground.  As Bolt fell he saw the worm&#39;s stinger extended ready to skewer him when he landed.  Bolt panicked then the idea struck him. He desperately tried to run in the air and extended his claws.  He caught the stinger and landed smartly on his feet.  One problem with fighting worms was that with their friction on the ground it was hard to throw them.  Now his legs were extended Bolt span round like he was about to throw a discuss.  The worm flew around in a circuit then went flying as Bolt let go.  He landed messily, after several seconds the whistle blew.  Kain sighed and watched Bolt celebrate to the cheering crowd.  He had got to A class.  The first expert class. <BR> <BR>His next match was at mid-day and there were only eight competitors left.  Lisa and Zack rushed to great him as he and Bolt entered the room happily.  Kain and Bolt rested by the pool while Destiny and Fierce trained in defence.  It was the tip top of the competitors left. Kain knew Bolt had something now. <BR> <BR>His next opponent was a strong monster.  A furry, fat ginger cat with a green Mohawk.  It was watching Bolt up to the point where the whistle blew then he was off. It ran up close to Bolt and struck his face with his palms.  Bolt smacked his fluffy hands away easily and went to clamp him in his pincer.  The fluffy creature leapt back and curled into a ball.  It left a trail of sand as it ran into Bolt&#39;s side.  Bolt got angry and swiped at the monster.  The fluffy ball grew to a gigantic size and leapt into the air for a giant press attack.  Bolt saw his chance and aimed his stinger upright.  The ball slid on slowly and blood poured from it.  The ball shrank and Bolt withdrew his tail leaving an impaled monster lying unconscious on the floor.  The whistle blew and Kain leapt with joy.  He had got through to S class.  Only three other monsters would make it this far.  Tomorrow he would be playing three matches and if he won enough then he would win the tournament. <BR> <BR>That night was another celebration, the money from the win alone was enough to pay for three feasts, but they only had one.  Giant rolls of brown meat, thin oily fish fried to perfection, grapes and oranges.  The food was a giant pile and the six of them polished it all off.   <BR> <BR>Kain only found out his opponents the next day.  Lisa had offered to tell him but he wanted to keep it a surprise.  His first match was the first of the day.  He thought about it while he poured nut oil down Bolt&#39;s throat.  These monsters had all beaten the same classes as him and worked their way up from E class.  His first enemy monster was obvious as soon as he walked on the field.  A giant purple golem with bright purple eys.  They were glowing evilly and he chuckled in a deep granity way.  In his mouth Kain could see tiny rows of razor sharp teeth.   <BR> <BR>The whistle blew and Bolt looked to Kain. Kain motioned to stay away and fight from afar, he knew he would never be able to hear him over the noise of the crowd.  Bolt jumped backwards in huge bounds and opened his claws.  Blasts of light fired from them and hit the Golem.  He seemed to shrug them off.  The battle was long.  Both monsters were pretty much neck and neck.  The giant purple mountain only got a couple of hits in but they were very powerful.  Bolt had hit a lot of times but the golem did not even seem to react.  Finally Bolt&#39;s stinger ended the first S class match and the giant lummox fell to the floor.  Bolt was obviously out of breath and Kain knew that it would damper his chances in the next two fights.  When he went back to the changing rooms Lisa and Zack were waiting for him looking pleased.  <BR> <BR>&#34;We have some good news, they held the other match in a separate nearby stadium and one of the competitors was injured.  This means you automatically beat him and only have one enemy left.  It was some kind of dark tiger.&#34; Lisa managed to say it all in one go. <BR> <BR>Kain laughed and reached into his rucksack.  He felt around inside and withdrew a glass bottle containing a light green liquid.  He opened it and held it to Bolt&#39;s mouth.  Bolt drank the oils happily.  Lisa told him that he had four hours before his match with the tiger.  They all went back to the hotel and Bolt slept the entire time.  When Kain walked out he knew one thing.  Even if he lost then he could still win, but if he won he could not lose.  The enemy monster was the one thing in his way to victory. <BR> <BR> <BR>The whistle rang out through his spine.  The monster was nasty looking.  It was darker and its deep blood coloured eyes shone like tiny rubies.  It growled deeply and its eyes flashed.  It jumped forward and bit the air where Bolt had been standing.  Bolt brought both his claws down upon the tiger and it howled as it was crushed against the floor.  It whipped Bolt in the eye with its tail and then crawled out from under the giant gold pincers. There was a black flash and the crowd gasped.  It was so fast.  Before Bolt could realise the tiger was scratching at his body.  He leapt back and fired his stinger into the dark hounds foot.  There was another howl and then the tiger opened his mouth and fired a blast of ice and snow.  Bolt fell back.  Kain snarled, he needed this win. Bolt and the tiger were trading blows against each other.  Kain had to think, there had to be something he could do.  Bolt was looking at the demonic hound and firing bolts of energy from its claws. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fist missile!&#34; Kain shouted, he knew what it had been, an attack that had been shown in the floppy magazine that Lisa had shown them.  It had a section about monster attacks, and had shown that renocraft such as Bolt had an attack called fist missile.   <BR> <BR>Bolt clicked.  His claws shuddered and the tiger lept at him.  Halfway there Bolt&#39;s claws blasted out followed by a thick metal thread.  The claws hit the tiger with extreme force and then tied around him.  Bolt lifted the dazed monster up and shot a sting into him.  The body was dropped and the claws reeled in.  The whistle blew.  Kain just smiled, he had won.  Bolt was less dignified and jumped around beeping heavily.  Bolt had won the tournament.  Kain walked into the changing rooms and the opening to the crowd slammed shut behind him.  He turned sharply and looked around.  There was someone else in the room somewhere, he could feel it.  There was a flash of light and a man stood there.  He was wearing a black leather jacket and yellow tinted goggles.  Bolt aimed his stinger for him but did not fire. <BR> <BR>&#34;Kain isn&#39;t it? yes.  Well done Kain you won my tournament.  My name is detanracier and i organised this tournament.&#34;  The man had a gravely voice but it was interesting.   <BR> <BR>&#34;You have stumbled upon a large secret here, get your friends and bring them here.  The one with the beaclon and the ducken.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;How do you know?&#34; Kain asked quickly. <BR> <BR>He did not stay to find out and just went out of the room.  Lisa and Zack were just outside and he pulled them into the room to their muffled surprise.  The man looked at them and put a silver metal ball on the floor.  It exploded in beams of light and they were no longer in the changing rooms.  The world was silver and bright.  Electricity was running all around them.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Welcome to the labyrinth, I am an immortal soul.  I am possibly the most important single being on this earth.  It is my job to use monsters to help the universe along.  You three are about to become my accomplices.  You have proved you have power, great power.  If you say no then you will be sent to back and have no memory of this but please consider.  I raise monsters in an army.&#34; <BR> <BR>He pointed to his left and a row of hengars of all different sub types stood to attention.  They all span their left arms in unison and stood upright.                        <BR> <BR>&#34;They are treated with the same respect any ranch trained monster would have but I raise more than one at a time to overpower enemies more powerful than anything on earth.  I need to know if you will help.  You can leave when ever you want and I will not even try to stop you.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kain looked to Lisa and Zack.  Zack nodded and Lisa just smiled.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok, well help you.&#34; <BR> <BR>There was a high-pitched screech and the floor seemed to move slightly.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Look out that window.&#34;  The man said. <BR> <BR>Kain walked to a window and looked out.  It was dark with hundreds of stars, the earth was about the size of a ball and far away.  Kain was shocked into silence.  The ship was carrying them through space.  They had joined a force that tried to keep the universe in shape.  They received uniforms the next day.  They also explored the many areas of ship, hundreds of different monsters all training separately.  Kain knew that it was what he was meant for.
