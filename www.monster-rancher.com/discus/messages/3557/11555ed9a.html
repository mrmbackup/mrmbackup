 &#42;ding ding&#42; <BR> <BR>Lethander stared at his opponent, Hesferion doing the same. Slow, methodical movements of their hands and shoulders, fist clinching and releasing themselves, preparing for battle. <BR> <BR>Then, slowly as before, Lethander&#39;s hand filled with a yellow light. Eventually it encompassed his hands in their entirety. Hesferion just stared on, waiting for the first move. <BR> <BR>The Naga&#39;s hands shot behind him, then forward likewise, unleashing their contents at the on looking Dragon. Lethander&#39;s eyes lit up, sending twin red beams pursuing their energy counterparts. The balls whizzed and spun around each other, eventually the beam catching up, and sat between them. <BR> <BR>Hesferion pulled his left wing over his body, as if to block. Then suddenly, with speed not befitting a Dragon, his wing shot out and up, slapping both balls into the air. The beam, however, refracted into the coliseum wall. That explosion was instantaneous, sending humans fleeing for the higher stands. Two explosions rang shortly after, and Harvenger looked into the dark sky. It seemed like two stars were exploding, as the others watched on in awe, eventually overtaken shortly by the light of the blast. <BR> <BR>Lethander looked a little dumbstruck, but not overly so. He knew better than to sling out this strongest moves this early, that lets an opponent know for a fact he is stronger than you. Again, the Dragon stared back, always looking a bit unsure of himself, a little spooked of his foe. <BR> <BR>The Naga sneered, not certain if this was a trick, or if Hesferion was truly not confident in his abilities. <BR> <BR>Either way, Lethander would make short work of this chump. The Naga leaned back slowly. Knowing he was being watched, he wouldn&#39;t make any sudden movements save when the Dragon least expected it. Hesferion watched on, the giant Dragon clinching his hands into fists. <BR> <BR>Suddenly, Lethander pushed all his weight off his powerful tail, soaring into the night air. The Dragon moved only his eyes to follow his foe. Lethander spun in midair, looking like a demented comet as he fell from the sky. His tail pointed down, spinning as a drill, but Harvenger could make out the smile on his face every time it came around. <BR> <BR>Lethander opened his eyes wide as the air born Dragon&#39;s knee slammed into his stomach. It knocked the wind out of him, and stopping his spin abruptly. Lethander saw the ground was actually getting further away, as these moments seemed like lifetimes. He felt another dry cough escape his lips as the Dragon switched knees, pulling one out and replacing it with the other. Lethander saw the ground still pulling away as he rose higher. <BR> <BR>A large, scaly palm fell to his neck, with long, wicked fingers pulling around to his throat, and those sharp, lethal claws digging into his skin, confirming their purchase for sure. Hesferion slung the Naga strait up, and Lethander&#39;s body spun in the air. <BR> <BR>Lethander&#39;s back was to the ground when the two fists connected. A duel, flying punch into the center of the Naga&#39;s back. Harvenger thought it a miracle that it didn&#39;t break the spine. The Dragon wasted no time with his follow ups, as he flipped the Naga once, and continued to switch fists into his stomach. <BR> <BR>The Dragon was flying, yes, but the Naga was staying air born as well, at least for a minute now. Even a minute seemed like forever from the audience, it must be horrible for Lethander, Harvenger thought. <BR> <BR>Suddenly, the Dragon let him fall shortly, rising him back up with a knee to the gut once more. This time, he pulled it back and raised both hands over his head. Hesferion&#39;s legs extended out as he slammed his balled up fists into the Naga with all the force his body could muster. Both hit on the middle of Lethander&#39;s back and sent the Naga spiraling for the ground. <BR> <BR>&#34;Man, the Dragon sure knows how to concentrate attacks...&#34; One of the spectator&#39;s said. <BR> <BR>Harvenger had to agree as the Naga slammed into the ground, softened only by the rising dust. As Harvenger stared into the dust cloud, it became alive with fire. Rolling across the ground from the impact point, the Kato&#39;s eyes traced a stream of flame up to the Dragon, who&#39;s maw was opened fully, expelling as much of his species destruction as he could. So Harvenger thought... <BR> <BR>The aerial dirt ran with the flame in droves and rings, filling a good portion of the arena. Then, a single white ball flew from the flames, running directly in line with the fire stream. It connected squarely between the eyes of the Dragon, and had to be the most amazing and luckiest shot Harvenger had ever seen. <BR> <BR>The Dragon&#39;s head jerked back, if not from shock or surprise, then from sheer impact. The flame rose and ripped through one section of the stadium spectators. People were on fire now, burning and dying. Screams filled the stands as hordes and droves of people began trying to flee. Harvenger found himself almost trampled by the fleeing humans, and jumped onto the side of the divider. Someone pushed past someone else, who pushed Harvenger. He found himself falling backward. Naturally, being a Kato, he gracefully turned in air and landed on his feet. <BR> <BR>The ground was warm, and he turned to realize he had actually fallen into the arena. Staring into the dusty mist that was mere feet from him, he could see a shadow slowly trying to rise. Then, in a blur, another shadow fell with blinding speed, and the dust cloud rushed the Kato, and consumed him. <BR> <BR>Harvenger coughed a few times as he heard the thuds of something being punched, or slammed to the ground, how could he tell in this? This must end, people are dying now. Harvenger&#39;s claws shot out, and waved in front of him madly. <BR> <BR>A large cylinder of wind pulled most of the dust up, but also kept pulling dust up, even the settled dirt on the ground. Eventually, he cut it loose and the twister flew strait ahead, towards the shadows. <BR> <BR>When it reached them, the Kato heard a slashing sound as the tornado erupted and the dust flew out in rings again. Unsure of where the attack came from, Hesferion bolted into the air, the dust cloud hanging to him with small, dissipating lines. <BR> <BR>His eyes darted this way, then that, trying to pin point the one who interfered. Harvenger decided to let him know what he was and where, in his own way. <BR> <BR>Hesferion was furious. Finally had his foe unconscious, and no referee here to call K.O. Further more, something decided to intervene, and that would be their last mistake. Suddenly, he felt an extremely light tug on his leg. He glanced down to find a little fur ball attached to his ankle, staring right back, with a grin evil enough to make Hesferion blink a few times. <BR> <BR>Then, out of its furry little paws, blades erupted. With speed faster than his eye and nerves could match, the Kato slammed his right claws, all three, full length, into the Dragon&#39;s leg. Before the pain of the first stabbing had reached his mind, the cat creature had stabbed him with the other arm, a bit higher. With amazing speed, the little rodent climbed the great Dragon who, all the while, roared with extreme pain. <BR> <BR>Slinging his head around on his long neck, the Dragon gazed down at the Kato implanted in his back, right between the wings. The head shot back and forward, snapping at the nimble monster. Suddenly, Hesferion felt a burning sensation on the left side of his face. Blood slowly trickled onto his brow, then fell off in little drops in front of his eye. The Kato smiled on. It was time to end that smiling... <BR> <BR>Harvenger felt his speed was superior to this guy&#39;s. Suddenly, technique overcame any other advantage. The wings slammed together, towards each other, utterly crushing Harvenger. The Kato felt a sharp pain in his left arm, and assorted other parts of his body. The wings held true as the two plummeted back to the ground. <BR> <BR>The Dragon braced the landing well but, right before he hit the ground, he extended his wings, blasting a gust of air down to assist his landing. Harvenger, however, got to feel the full impact of a fall from that height, plus the strength that gravity pulls on an enormous Dragon. <BR> <BR>The fall was hard, and that made his arm hurt more. Harvenger realized his shoulder was dislocated, and popped it back in quickly. A burning sensation fell into his body as the pain seemed to spread and tear through everything. He blinked a few times, slack jawed, sighing heavily as he rose, slowly bending his sore arm back and forth. <BR> <BR>A massive shadow rose in front of him, the wings falling behind him again. The shadow&#39;s head arched directly towards Harvenger, and he could see the ember glow forming therein. <BR> <BR>Orange light ripped through the debris once more as a wave of flame flew just above the Kato. Harvenger darted directly towards his legs, slashing at the wounds already there, making sure as much dirt that could get in there, did. The head turned down, and again, Harvenger found himself once step ahead of the flame, but still one step too close. The hair on his left leg ignited in the inferno, and he hastily patted it out and lay still, behind Hesferion. <BR> <BR>He had stopped his flame attack when he hit his own feet, surely that rat is burned and dead by now. As he kicked around the dirt directly under him, searching for a corpse, a huge energy ball slammed into his chest. The Dragon stumbled back. <BR> <BR>Harvenger closed his eyes tightly as the massive Dragon foot landed inches from his head, sending dirt into his ears. The Kato rolled back a bit, and rose slowly behind the distracted Dragon. <BR> <BR>Hesferion was furious. Monsters that grit at the end are very annoying. The Naga flew from the shadows and ripped his claw into Hesferion&#39;s chest. A moderate gash appeared there, squirting trails of blood at the Naga in retaliation. Lethander grinned and this sight, if he could bleed, he could be defeated. <BR> <BR>Lethander thought he might have lost some teeth in that grin, as he toppled to his left and to the ground. The Dragon uncurled his fist as he pulled his right leg back, kicking Lethander in the gut. The Naga flew somewhere into the dust storm with a thud. <BR> <BR>Then, Hesferion felt something on his tail, very light. It was moving quickly, like a tingle, to his body then up his back and between his wings. He twisted the massive neck attached to his head. As he looked, he saw only the shadow flying up his back. His left eye, the side that had been cut before, was showered in red, then darkness, and pain. <BR> <BR>The Kato continued on his run to his shoulder, in which he bounded off and hid in the dust again as the mighty Dragon wailed an ungodly scream of anguish. Harvenger had slashed his left face twice before, and he had just slashed it three more times. He didn&#39;t understand the extent of his damage until Hesferion yelled for him. <BR> <BR>&#34;You blasted rat! You tore out my eye! I&#39;ll kill you all! I&#39;ll kill EVERYONE!&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, flame and destruction unknown to anything but dreams flew from the center of that stadium. Stands, walls, people, observing monsters, all being destroyed and melted in a blitzkrieg of flame. The Dragon jumped in the air, with one gust from his wings, landed in the stands, killing a fleeing Moochi instantly. He turned his sight to the arena in which his foes still laid somewhere within. <BR> <BR>Harvenger darted to the wall as the flames poured into the pits like a smelting pot. As the Kato bounded out of the dust and onto the edge of the wall, he turned towards the Dragon, and saw his handy work. <BR> <BR>The left eye had a X running trough the center in a sadistic, almost perfect cut. No doubt his vision had failed in that eye, and the right bounced around enraged. His severed eye seemed to vomit blood, running down his neck and shoulder. Obviously, he had never been wounded like this. Ever. <BR> <BR>The right eye stopped on the Kato, and Harvenger was indeed intimidated by the massive Dragon, surrounded by the fires of his own handiwork. Before he could do anything further, a blast of ice slammed into his chest, toppling the great Dragon. <BR> <BR>Entering the gates, were assorted monsters, and men armed with armor, shields, and assorted weapons, all flying the banner of Languard. Two men led them. Both dressed in what almost seemed like bishop robes, yet were quite colorful. One was assorted blue and spotless white, and he had his right hand outstretched towards the bellowing Hesferion. The other held his hands together, as if in prayer, chanting lightly as the fires began to dissipate. He was wearing bright orange mixed with brilliant red. <BR> <BR>Lethander emerged from the dust in an upward diving fashion. Spinning wildly in the air, he began to plummet at the stunned Hesferion. A hand of ice slammed into the Naga, grasping him, and fell back into the dust. Harvenger didn&#39;t get the chance to do anything. As he watched Lethander fall back into concealment, he looked towards the duo. The one in orange raised his hand towards him, and a cage of flame enveloped Harvenger. <BR> <BR>It was hot, and small. Before he knew what happened, the flame froze into wavy bars of solid ice. The Kato was in shock, he had heard that the magic of Languard was potent, but this was amazing. Two men had just stopped three dueling monsters. <BR> <BR>Harvenger heard a shatter and corrected his number down to two in his mind. Hesferion rose like a bolt of lightning, screaming down at the helpless Kato, &#34;I will not forget you...and you will remember me...and we shall meet again!&#34; <BR> <BR>Assorted arrows and monster projectile attacks riddled the sky, and were either dodged by, or bounced off of the Dragon. <BR> <BR>&#34;I will kill you for this...Harvenger...&#34; As the mighty red wings beat hard into the sky, and eventually, into the distance. <BR> <BR>&#34;How&#39;d he know my name?&#34; Harvenger thought, amazed, he had not even spoken to that monster. <BR> <BR>The one in blue robes approached the ice cage and spoke lightly, &#34;So, you are Shilieka&#39;s little trouble maker, right?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>-Slightly rushed, but fairly gory. Not bad trade. Enjoy CHB-

 WOW! This is really good. Listening to Harvenger makes me want to go and raise a Kato right now, which is something I would never do. The writing is great! I can&#39;t wait for the next part. <BR> <BR>ps: Who said that gory was bad? ;&#41;

 Very nice. I can&#39;t wait for the next installment. The storyline is great and the way you describe things it feels like I&#39;m there in the arena watching the horrible brawl between three monsters.
