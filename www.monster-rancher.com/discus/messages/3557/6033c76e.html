 Hundreds of dragons.  Long scaly dragons.  They lie in rows, piles and on top of one another.  Their tails coiled in spirals wrapped around their legs.  The dragons were here.  They were not moving or showing any signs of life.  They were not alive, they were frozen in time.  Time had captured the dragons and put them somewhere else.  A separate dimension where they were out of the way.  In a world where nothing happens it is easier to notice small things.  One of these small things was about to happen.  A single gold eye flickered.  It slowly opened revealing a small red flash of light.  The other eye flashed next to it.  The dragons were awaking.   <BR> <BR>&#34;That&#39;s it, faster!&#34;  A Woman was standing with her fists clenched as a bright wooden duck and a shellfish were battling.  The Shell was coiled and a pink face was sticking out.  Pink tentacles were spinning at great speed and whipping the toy.  Fierce was standing with its flippers defending its face as the tentacles continued to slap it.  Zack was watching carefully and seemed like he wanted to say something.  The ducken acted on its own first.  A webbed foot pushed off the ground and swung off a spinning tentacle.  The white wood landed a few feet away facing the Nitons back.  It ran at the shell and slammed its beak against the hard edge.  The niton laughed happily and withdrew into the wood coloured shield.  Zack clicked.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Flip it up Fierce.&#34;  He shouted. <BR> <BR>The duck nodded and looked angrily at the shell.  Its neck extended and its beak forced its way under.  The niton did not react.  The Duck forced its head up and the shell went flying straight up. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now falling beak!&#34;   <BR> <BR>As the shell reached the top of its arc Fierce&#39;s neck grew longer and longer, Fierce took a split second to line it up then threw it downwards.  The shell sped towards the ground with the beak pushing it.  There was a crash and a cloud of dust as Fierce pulled his neck back to normal size.  The shell was lying silently and both trainers watched it desperately.  A pink face fell out and its eyes rolled towards the sky.  Fierce started dancing and spinning its centre portion.   <BR> <BR>The women walked up to her monster and lifted it up by the shell.  Four tentacles and a pink face drooped out.  The woman put the shell down gently and got out some medicinal spray and a thin jet of green liquid settled on its face.  Zack laughed at the dancing toy and reached for a fish in his rucksack.  Kain was sitting on a cliff side looking out to sea with Bolt.  Bolt picked up a pebble and dropped it down towards the sea.  It was swallowed by the bottle green ocean and made a plop noise.  Fierce ran up chewing on the middle part of a fish with its tail and head hanging out its mouth.  Bolt beeped and turned towards Kain.  Kain sighed and looked in his bag.  There was a juicy piece of meat hanging on a marrow rich bone and he grabbed the greasy paper holding it and unwrapped it.  There was a happy beep as Bolt dug in.  The sunset reflected off the sea in bright shards of crystalline light.  The splashing of the waves way down below made all four travellers tired.  There was a nice cooling wind pulling the salty sea breeze upwards off the water and over the cliff face.  Kain fell asleep to the crackling of a dieing fire and the whoosh of the waves.  He had a strange dream.  There was a rock in the water, it was empty but there was a shadow there.  Kain was standing on his own amongst a bundle of red.  He could see the waves get worse and a shape arise from the water.  It was Mia, she was floating on a small arm of water that placed her on the rock, Kain tried to shout but no noise came out.  She had a harp and was playing.  A dark hole was in the sky and it was slowly opening.  It was pouring blackness into the sky.  Then he awoke. <BR> <BR>Bolt and Fierce were already awake and it was a bright morning.  Zack woke up to the smell of eggs and fish.  Kain was cooking them on a stick over the fire.  Zack closed his eyes again and then tried to prop himself up on an arm as he rubbed his head. Fierce and Bolt threw a fish to each other and then spilt it in half.  Fierce span round in circles as the fish slid down his neck.  Bolt ripped his half in two then eat one after the other.  Kain and Zack were once again watching the waves.  Down below a huge Zilla pushed its head from the water and took a breath. It ducked its head down below the rippling water and disappeared.  That&#39;s when he heard it.  Bolt looked up, just a little noise.  The sound of the waves almost overthrew it but Bolt could just hear a pinging noise.  It was high pitched and awful but there was a kind of tune there.  He looked around desperately but none of the others seemed to hear it. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why noise?&#34;  Bolt ventured. <BR> <BR>&#34;Noise waves.&#34;  Said Kain as he bit into a fish and oil dripped onto the floor. &#34;It ok.&#34;   <BR> <BR>Bolt thought for a bit then tried again. <BR> <BR>&#34;Other noise, pleep noise like...piche piche piche.&#34;  The noise came from his throat and he knew it was wrong.  He gave up. <BR> <BR>In the land where time has no meaning the dragons are now all awake.  There are millions of them.  They writhe and twist their wings opening and closing and their claws flailing.  They are all different colours.  Many are red but some are blue, some are white and some are silver.  A giant Tiger&#39;s head with huge horns roared and its blue and white body stomped along the ground.  A black wing flew open and fluttered as a thin black snake like body rocketed into the air.           <BR> <BR>Lisa ran along a thin path.  Her feet pounded against the gravel and she turned her head.  She laughed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Come one, you gonna let me win?&#34;  She shouted. <BR> <BR>A grey bolt rocketed past her.  A giant worm made from rock turned its head and made clicking noises.  It had deep green eyes and a long brown tongue.  Lisa sped up and tried catch up with it but it had already reached the finish line.  Lisa panted and reached for a green bag.  She pulled a green spring of herbs from it and threw them to her worm.  The worm jumped to the floor and sucked the mint leaf up off the ground.  It smiled and waved its tail happily.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t do that, it doesn&#39;t really match your name does it.&#34;  Zack laughed. <BR> <BR>Fierce tilted its head and stopped dancing; it stood bolt upright and its centre portion span round in a hula.  Bolt was once again looking out to sea.  He wasn&#39;t sure if he could hear the noise.  It had been playing in his head ever since.  The music started.  The twanging strings started their mono layered tone.  Bolt looked around desperately but no one seemed to notice.  There was a rock out at sea.  A large needle of stone.  Its lower edges were smooth but as it reached into the air, its rocky surface got bumpy and craggy.  It was not far out of the water only maybe 20 feet.  Bolt strained his eyes.  There was a tree or some shape on the rock.  He couldn&#39;t tell what it was.  The music slowly stopped and the shape fell.  It fell threw the air and burst into the water.  There was very little splash.  Later that evening the trainers and their monsters walked down a steep path to the sea.  Fierce swam like a natural, his body segments span in opposite directions.  The top and bottom segments span anti clockwise while the middle span clockwise, the segments dancing like cogs.  He ducked and dived over and under the water and quaked happily.  Bolt paddled gingerly in the waters edge and raced the small breaking waves to the sand.  Zack and Kain watched them while they eat some more fish.  The fish was packed and monster food.  It was ok for humans to eat but not very good quality.  It was very salty and very strong.  Kain shuddered as salty juice ran down his throat.  Zack put the fish down and looked for his bag.  It was over by Kain. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey Kain, pass my bag please&#34; <BR> <BR>The bag hit the dusty white sand and a cloud shot into the air.  Zack turned for the fish.  It was gone.  He heard a crunch and saw a grey rock in the sand.  It was small and cone shaped, with the spike up.  He stroked his chin as it wriggled slightly.  Kain had seen it.  They both slowly walked up to it.  Zack held up three fingers and slowly dropped one then the next then the last.  As it fell both of them grabbed the rock and pulled.  The rock squirmed and writhed in their hands as a long grey body was pulled from the sand.  It landed on the sand and Kain fell on his back still clutching the creature&#39;s tail.  The creature was made of grey rock and looked to be of the worm breed.  It had great green eyes that reflected the startled Zack&#39;s face.  It suddenly snapped out of the trance its fear had put it in and tried to run.  Its legs pumped at the ground and it sped off.  Zack watched it for a second then whistled.  The quaking from the water stopped and Fierce dived for the shore.  He jumped quickly and landed in front of the grey snout.  The worm skidded to a halt and turned around.  Kain got up and nodded at the creature while looking at Bolt.  Bolt jumped in large slow bounds toward the monster and landed just in front of it.  The worm panicked again and turned a couple of times.  Fierce was spinning his centre body part ready to launch a boomerang attack and Bolt&#39;s claws were open and glowing.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Stop!  Please don&#39;t hurt him!&#34;  A voice shouted in alarm from behind Kain.  Both Bolt and Fierce looked for the source of the voice and the monster took his chance and dived over Bolt towards a woman.  She was of medium size and quite thin.  Long brown hair reached down her body with two red bands holding it together.  The worm ran along the ground and stood by her leg.  Her face was a portrait of worry. <BR>  <BR>&#34;Sorry but this monster is not wild it is mine, his name is Rocky.  He went exploring and ended up here.&#34; <BR> <BR>Zack smiled and patted Fierce on the head.  Bolt was still suspecting watching Rocky.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh I am sorry my name is Lisa.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hi Lisa, I&#39;m Zack and this is Fierce.&#34;   <BR> <BR>Fierce danced at the sound of his name and smiled at Lisa. <BR> <BR>&#34;My names Kain and this is my Renocraft Bolt&#34; <BR> <BR>Bolt beeped and waved his claws.   <BR> <BR>Lisa stayed with them all afternoon on the beach and eat dinner with them.  She had proper fish and Kain was cooking it while the others sat around the fire.  Bolt was starting to trust Rocky and was sucking the juicy jelly from its plastic cup.  Bolt stopped, he could hear the noise and he looked around. Rocky had heard it and looked at him.  Bolt pointed a claw at the rock.  It was harder looking upward but the shape was there.  The tune was different and the temperature dropped.  A cold breeze was blowing powerfully.  None of the others mentioned anything but Lisa subconsciously placed her coat over her shoulders.   <BR> <BR>A red tail swayed across the floor.  It was trailing the giant red body like a long thick snake.  It curved and waved slightly in the air and then back to the ground.  The land of the dragons was no longer a trap.  There was a hole.  It was a pinprick but big enough to let a ray of light in.  The dragons had gathered around the light and were watching it.  The hole was tiny but had purple energy running around its rim.  It was a dark purple and glowed evilly.  The hole was the start of a great event.  An event that wasn&#39;t supposed to happen yet.  The dragons knew it wasn&#39;t supposed to of happened but they knew it had.  The ray of light was illuminating a tiny black spot on the floor.  The spot was glowing evilly.  The dragons did not know how it was supposed to happen.  <BR> <BR>Sweat formed in tiny beads and trickled off Fierce&#39;s beak.  Bolt and Rocky were running about three metres behind and looked just as tired.  Fierce looked to the trainers, they were sitting down on the sand watching and shouting occasional words of encouragement.  The sand was harder to run on than grass and it got harder and harder to pull your feet up from the thick dust. Fierce stopped and fell into the cloudy broken down rocks.  He looked out to sea and the figure was there just as he suspected.  Bolt and Rocky had stopped and stood frozen.  Fierce felt happy as he turned and all three trainers were looking around.  Everyone had noticed.  He knew it couldn&#39;t be his imagination and he quaked loudly while pointing to the rock where the shape stood.  All the others stared up and the music continued.  Wind blew up from nowhere and Lisa&#39;s long hair whispered behind her.  Zack shielded his eyes against the wind and looked up at the sky.  The chirping birds that had inhabited the bright evening sky moments before had left and the sky was cloudy and dark.  Kains mouth opened involuntarily, the darkness of the sky was being concentrated in the sky.  A few miles out to sea the sky was still bright and the brightness was getting nearer as the darkness was sucked into a thin beam.  It shot into the sea and the water parted noisily and steamily.  Light shot off and the water fired up.  There was a huge globe under the water.  It was made of darkness and as the ray stopped the sphere rose slowly into the air.  Water was pouring from the top and dripping from the bottom and the sphere began to turn.  Holes of light appeared in it.  Inside the ball was a mass of red.  It was dark red and it looked like oil in a lava lamp.  Suddenly the ball exploded.   <BR>Rays of gold and red fired off in all directions.  They slowed as they spread out, wings were forming and many of the rays were changing colour.  Bolt beeped quietly and Lisa was slowly moving her mouth.  The rays were all slowing now and changing direction.  They twisted and span in the air as the wings and rays grew larger. Kain fell to the ground and Bolt ducked under his claws.  Dragons.  The rays were forming in to dragons and flying in all directions.  They were huge.  Some were furred; one that looked like a serpentine tiger with wings flew down towards the water and skimmed the surface.  Another dragon that had bright white skin spiralled up into the air and dived down.  Zack had forgot about the music.  It was still playing and the figure was playing.  The wind was still intense.  The figure stopped playing and dived into the water.  She never made it.  A giant red dragon swooped past and grabbed her in its jaws. It swung round and threw her to the sand.  The dragon flew off into the sunset, as were all the others.  Kain looked down at the figure.  She was a woman but looked wrong.  Her skin was a dark grey and she had black marks on her face.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I think it&#39;s an undine they are quite rare.&#34;  Said Lisa.   <BR> <BR>It was lying silently on the sand, slightly moving but not a lot.  It opened its eyes and stared at Lisa.  Rocky moved uncomfortably.  The siren opened its mouth and spoke.  Its voice was soft and soothing. <BR> <BR>&#34;I have summoned them, the dragons.  They were supposed to be at the harps control.  The sea harp can send them back.&#34; <BR> <BR>Her hands closed around an invisible object and light filled the space.  She was holding a golden harp.  It was made of sand and had shells placed around it.  There were no strings until she stared at the place where they should be.  Water drops stretched along the length of the instrument.  She looked back at Kain. <BR> <BR>&#34;Take the sea harp.  Destroy the dragons, these are wild dragons.  Powerful and nasty.  They will kill you easily.  The world&#39;s greatest trainers are trying to take some of them out as we speak.  They are possibly to strong and definitely to many.  Use the harp and destroy it.&#34;   <BR> <BR>Kain took the harp.  The siren faded silently and melted into water.  It trickled down the beak and into the sea.  Kain looked at the sea harp and at the orb of darkness.  It was still floating there.  Kain dropped the harp to the floor and Bolt placed it in its pincers.  They clamped shut and the harp lay in three pieces.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank god, I wonder how this works.&#34;  Zack looked at the dark sphere. <BR> <BR>The harp suddenly twanged.  Water jets fired out and rejoined the pieces.  They pulled together and sealed up.  Bolt cut it in half and the same occurred.  Fierce pulled it apart and fired a missile at it, the same.  Rocky shot his stinger at it and the same.  Kain threw it against a rock. It bounced off and flew up into the air.  There was a crunch.  Kain looked up. <BR> <BR>A shadow was above them.  It was too dark to see the object but it was huge.  It flew away slowly and swooped towards the sea.  It was a dragon.  Its scaled skin was jet black and its fangs were long and pointed.  Its eyes twinkled and Kain saw the harp resting on a sharp canine tooth.  Bolt beeped with the noise that monsters made when they were scared but trying to be confident.  Fierce waved his flippers around and stared at the creature.  The dragon fluttered upright and waited near the beach then it stared at Rocky.  His fists tightened and Rocky dived to the side as the dragon&#39;s fist burst into flames.  It swung its fists at the worm who just managed to jump over the flaming mass.  The dragon flew back upright.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Zeth the third dragon.  Bow before master scythe&#34; The dragon&#39;s speech was flowing but also snake like.   <BR> <BR>Rocky burst from the sand where he had been hidden.  Bolt opened his already glowing claws and launched several rounds of energy.  They rocketed threw the air and the dragon held out his fist.  They dispersed painlessly and the dragon laughed.  It flew straight at Bolt and sent him flying.  Bolt looked angrily at the dragon as he flew back.  He curled into a ball and rolled at the dragon, just as he reached it his sting struck its arm.  The dragon did not so much scream as his, it was high pitched but still hissing.  Bolt fell into the water below the dragon and the creature looked down at the water as blood dripped in a flowing river.  Zeth flew up and then turned violently and spiralled into the clear water.  Kain gritted his teeth as the splash came off.  There was a blast from under the water and Zeth flew out with Bolt on his neck.  Bolt had his claws dug into the small of Zeth&#39;s snake like neck.  Zeth was writhing and shaking desperately to get Bolt off but he held on and drove Zeth towards the beach.  As he came in and hit the sand it fired up like a car skidding in grit.  Fierce and Rocky nodded at each other and leapt into the fray.  Slowly the cloud died down and Bolt crawled panting and beeping.  The Dragon was lying flat on the floor with a deep wound in its shoulder.  Its blood ran down into the sea and was slowly sucked up by the dark orb it was being absorbed and spread around the sphere.  Lisa walked carefully up to the carcass of Zeth and pulled the harp from his mouth.  She shook it then turned to Zack and Kain. <BR> <BR>&#34;He said he was the third dragon.  Maybe there are two more.&#34; <BR> <BR>Zack was looking at the dark sphere and pointing.  There was a head coming from the orb.  A body and wings were slowly coming through.  They passed through as if the orb were water or slick oil.  A golden dragons head erupted its way out. It had a green ball underneath its neck and huge golden wings.  It flew straight to the beach edge and lowered itself.   <BR> <BR>&#34;I am the second dragon.  Master Scythe will take you all.  My name is Techno and I shall be your last foe.&#34;  The dragons voice was similar to Bolts and Kain thought that they probably ad the same Hengar sub breed. <BR> <BR>It flew back into the air and swung its huge metal tail.  The trainers had to duck to avoid it and to an unready human the mighty smash could have been fatal.  Bolt tried to stand up properly but fell back to its knees.  It looked unhappy then beeped sadly.  Kain ran up and grabbed it just before the tail came crashing down on the sand.  Zack and Lisa looked at each other and called their monsters.  Fierce and Rocky looked at the golden dragon then ran at it.  A tail swipe sent Rocky skidding in the sand.  Fierce span his centre portion and it boosted him into the air.  He fired it off at the dragon who smacked it away with the back of his claw.  Techno&#39;s mouth opened showing razor sharp canines made of pure gold.  He threw hi face at Fierce who jumped the first bite but was crushed by the second.  Fierce fell to the ground then managed to get back up.  He glared at the dragon and they locked eyes.  Techno smirked as they stared deep into each other&#39;s pupils.  Fierce could just see his reflection in the deepest corner of Techno&#39;s pupil.  Fierce heard a shrill growl.  He looked to the side and saw Rocky.  He had his tail stuck in Techno&#39;s leg and was injecting thick lumps of venomous liquid into it.  Techno shook the stinger out and stared at his leg.  Fierce saw his chance.  Techno fell backwards into the shallow water making a tiny splash but a louder boom.  There was a thin yellow disc with wings on it stuck in his neck.  Blood was pouring from the wound and seemed to be crawling up an invisible stairway.  The orb was getting stronger.  The trainers all looked to the sphere.  There was something coming through.  It couldn&#39;t be seen yet but it was coming.  There was a flash and it rocketed out.  A huge skeletal head looked at the trainers and its large bone body unravelled.   <BR> <BR>&#34;I am scythe, the final dragon.  You killed my two strongest fighters but I will avenge them.&#34;  His voice was dry.  It was gravvely and whispery, like two smooth stones rubbing together. <BR> <BR>&#34;Bolt is still too weak, he can&#39;t fight.&#34;  Kain announced to the others as Scythe breathed heavily. <BR>&#34;Its just you two.&#34;   <BR> <BR>Fierce ran up confidently, it jumped and Scythe laughed.  There was the sound of bone hitting rock.  Fierce flew into the water.  He didn&#39;t sink quickly but slowly like a ferry with a pinhole leak.  Bubbles came to the surface and Lisa turned away.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Its just you and me now Fierce!&#34; Zack said solemnly. <BR> <BR>Scythe laughed at Fierce.  The duck growled from within his stomach and slapped his flippers together twice then stood in a ready stance.  Scythe growled slightly then opened his mouth.  Flames were dancing in his hollow head.  They were growing together and forming in a giant ball that shot off at the trainers and monsters.  Kain and Bolt jumped to the Right.  Lisa and Zack jumped to the left.  Fierce ducked.  It shot straight at him.  Flames burst around the place where Fierce was standing, where he had been standing.  Fierce dropped down next to Zack.  He was shocked but not even slightly burned.  Lisa looked up.  There was a creature there.  It was big, heavily built and brown.  It had a long horn and fast moving wings.  Scythe looked at it and growled.  Another fireball flew straight at the beaclon.  Its wings pushed it around the ball of flame and started to spiral in the air.  He slammed into the dragons stomach and they both fell into the water.  Flames burnt their way threw the water and a slightly charred beaclon flew out again followed closely by the dragon.  The dragon was snapping at the beaclons legs but missing by a bit.  The beaclon turned in the air and punched the dragon round the face three times.  Scythe fell in a nosedive towards the sea and splashed into the blue water.  The beaclon looked at the water then flew straight at Lisa.  She did not flinch even slightly as the huge creature landed right in front of her.  It took the harp gently and flew into the air.  The dragon burst from the sea and tried to snap at the beaclons legs.  The beaclon pulled his legs up and held the harp above his head.  Scythe dived at him and the beaclon threw it down at him.  There was a crash as the harp broke in two around him.  It reached his tail and the water extended its way around to repair it.  But this time it didn&#39;t repair it.  The watery strands wrapped around Scythe.  Scythe screeched as the water tied him up and began to move towards the orb.  He stared and growled evilly at the trainers as his head slowly disappeared.  The orb glowed bright gold then white then black again.  There was a high-pitched noise and the dragons all were suddenly there.  They stared blankly at the trainers and then the beaclon.  Then slowly one by one they flew back into the orb.  When the last had gone the orb slowly sunk back into the water.   <BR> <BR>The beaclon flew down next to Lisa. <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you ok Rocky?&#34;  She asked.  The beaclon nodded. <BR> <BR>&#34;That&#39;s Rocky?&#34;  Said Kain in disbelief. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yep its the forth week of June, worms sometimes do this at that age.  He is a beaclon now, a totally new breed.&#34;  Lisa sighed and then ummed for a while. <BR> <BR>&#34;The name Rocky is no longer suitable, how about...Destiny?&#34;   <BR> <BR>Destiny nodded happily then looked across to the other monsters.   <BR> <BR>They later found out about it. The dragons had never reached the next country.  Ten minutes more and they would have been national news, as it was no one even saw them.  Only Kain, Zack, Lisa, Bolt, Fierce, Destiny and the siren ever knew how close the world had come to total despair.  The adventure was not over but they did feel that the dragons were there for at least a little bit longer. <BR>   <BR>Hundreds of dragons.  Long scaly dragons.  They lie in rows, piles and on top of one another.  Their tails coiled in spirals wrapped around their legs.  The dragons were here.  They were not moving or showing any signs of life.  They were not alive, they were frozen in time.  Time had captured the dragons and put them somewhere else.  A separate dimension where they were out of the way.  In a world where nothing happens it is easier to notice small things.  If it had been a slightly different time or space then an eye might have blinked.  As it was nothing happened. <BR> <BR>Thank you for encouraging me to write and for your constructive criticism. Tell me if you liked the story.  Any one who visits this story can leave a post, just because Mepersoner or Torey or other common posters have not left a message doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have a right to voice your opinion.

 Wow Garlant your descriptions and wording have gotten a lot better since your last writing... is this purely coincidental or were you trying for it?
