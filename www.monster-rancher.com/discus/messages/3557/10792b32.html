Chase pointed his blaster at the huge rock man tromping slowly towards him.  Squaring his aim to the forehead of the beast, he resolved himself that the giant would not kill him without a fight.  As he solidified his aim, though, the golem halted his movement.  Putting his hand up, palm out, towards the downed smuggler, he spoke in a deep strong voice. <BR>	     &#34;No shoot Gnarl.  Gnarl not hurt.  Promise.&#34; <BR>	     Chase watched the golem, lowering his pistol merely an inch, still pointing it at the giant, but with less anger and defiance in his eyes now as the golem turned to the smashed gears of what was left of the Assassin Droid. <BR>	     &#34;Henger?&#34; the golem asked, pointing at the mess and looking back at Chase, who stared back blankly.  The golem shrugged and picked up a piece of the droid&#39;s arm, clutching it in his huge stone hand before turning back to the smuggler. <BR>     	&#34;You come.  Master want see you,&#34; the golem smiled dimly.  The sort of smile that seems legitimately friendly.  Something about the golem just seemed to tell Chase that it wasn&#39;t going to hurt him.  Whether that something was that the beast could have done it long before  <BR>now or not, he still tried to decide. <BR>	     &#34;Come!&#34; the giant said once more, his granite lips still trying to show that friendly smile as  <BR>he beckoned Chase to him.  Chase finally sighed, got to his feet and walked toward the golem, following as the stone man turned around and began to walk out the way he had entered the valley.  But as Chase passed a scorched part of the earth, he stopped and fell to his knees,  <BR>crying as his hands sifted through a small pile of ashes. <BR>     	&#34;Dant...&#34; Chase whimpered, calling his now departed fiancé&#39;s name out in the vain hope that there was some way to bring her back, or that hopefully his sorrow would lessen hers in the afterlife. <BR>     	&#34;Human?&#34; <BR>     	Chase looked at the golem again, who wasn&#39;t smiling anymore.  The granite being looked down sympathetically, pointed to the pile of ash that Chase knelt before, and simply said &#34;friend?&#34; <BR>	     &#34;Wife.&#34; <BR>	     The golem hung his head sadly before approaching the dismayed smuggler.  About to firmly place his hand on the shoulder to console the human, he realized at the last moment that normal force could cripple the man, and slowed to barely pat the wounded soul on the  <BR>shoulder. <BR>     	&#34;Me sorry.&#34; <BR>     	Chase sighed quietly and pulled himself together.  &#34;It&#39;s not your fault,&#34; he said sadly,  <BR>looking up at the stone giant.  &#34;Thank you, though, for helping.&#34; <BR>     	The golem smiled again, perking up.  &#34;No problem!  My job!  Master sent me here to train! Besides, no like Magma Heart.&#34;  Chase looked up at him, not knowing quite what the large one meant, but guessing he meant the dragon. <BR>     	&#34;You want ride?  Can carry,&#34; the golem cheerfully offered.  Chase couldn&#39;t help but smile and nod as the large stone man hefted the smaller human onto his shoulder and tromped down the valley. <BR> <BR>PezCat <BR>
