Well, I&#39;ve decided to embark on something big.  A war story about the ancient war that takes place 10,000 years before MR2.  This is where I&#39;ll give background information on what my story will be based on.  I also want this to be a collective effort, if you want to make a piece of the sotry, e-mail me at <A HREF="mailto:agent_krycek@hotmail.com">agent_krycek@hotmail.com</A> and I can almost guarantee you&#39;ll get it.  This is gonna be fun, don&#39;t miss out! <BR> <BR>Setting:  The year is 5421 AC &#40;After Creation&#41;.  About 20 years ago, monsters appeared out of what seemed like nowhere on this planet.  Human-kind considered this to be an act of God, and so immediately put these magnificent creatures to good use.  For 19 years, they provide the people with work, joy, and companionship.  However, something went wrong.  Much to the Human&#39;s dismay, these monsters proved to have an intelligence which matches their own, and many had been secretly plotting with eachother to overthrow their so-called opressers.  All agressively inclined monsters turned on their masters, resulting in an initial slaughter that claimed the lives of over 700,000 men, women, and children.  Luckily, the more passive monsters remained loyal, which deeply lessened the loss of life.  However, there were way too many angry monsters on the loose, so an alliance between all of the provinces, now called the the United Protection Forces, has been formed to quell the threat.  However, the monsters are far too clever, utilizing every species&#39; ability to wipe out the soldiers.  Mankind is fighting a losing battle................. <BR> <BR>United Protection Forces:  Technology would be comparable to WWII, except manned flight has not yet been achieved.  It is divided in a way very much similar to the way the army is.  There are a few special forces: <BR> <BR>Aqua-Troops: Amphibious soldiers <BR>Office of Secret Actions: Espionage and sabotage <BR>Elite Guard: A chosen few soldiers, who are trained in various forms of combat, and are experts with all forms of weaponry <BR> <BR>Also, the UPF is aided by Hengers, which are man-made machines programmed with monster-like internal characteristics.  Hengers are bristling with weaponry, including fist missiles, laser cannons; swords; and cutters, powerful arms and legs for hand-to-hand, and a blinding eye-beam.  However, the Hengers have not yet been tested and so some are skeptical about these machines. <BR> <BR> <BR>Monsters:  Remarkably, the monsters have assigned each species with a specialty. <BR> <BR>Zuums, Tigers, Nagas, and Golems: Front line fighters.  Golems can take a lot of damage, but are slow moving.  Zuums are extremely quick, and attack humans with their claws and teeth.  Tigers and Nagas do this as well, however they are far less efficient and deadly than Zuums are.   <BR> <BR>Zans: Stealth forces, they move swiftly and without a sound, then use their razor sharp claws to dispatch enemies.  They are quite rare, however. <BR> <BR>Zillas: Underwater forces, they move in the dark waters without being seen, then ram ships into submission. <BR> <BR>Jills: Arctic forces, They can survive in the cold better than any other monster, and are well camofaluged in it to boot.  They tend to catch the enemy by surprise. <BR> <BR>Durahans: They have not been seen yet, but are presumed to be very deadly with their armor and swords. <BR> <BR>Jokers: Although rare, these masters of the night hang around deserted town and wait for victims to come to them. <BR> <BR>Dragons: Few and far between, Dragons are almost never seen.  However, with their flamig breath, huge stomping feet, sharp teeth and class, and killing wings, they are easily the most feared monster of them all.  Rumor has it that a few dragons remained loyal, and are being used by the Elite Guard. <BR> <BR> <BR>That&#39;s all I have for now, I may add later.
