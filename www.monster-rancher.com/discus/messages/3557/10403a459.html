 Sarah and I both stood in awe.  Angel looked like her namesake, and what was more, she spoke.  Zan.  Was that what this creature was called?  Was this the &#39;dark secret&#39; that my father died to protect?  What does it do?  Why is it so dangerous?  Questions without answers surged through my mind. <BR> <BR>Faintly, I remember hearing Sarah&#39;s voice calling my name, I was apparently staring.  Angel was also looking at me, her eyes holding worry, and as all to often of late, sadness. <BR> <BR>&#34;How do we get it out of there?&#34;  I asked Angel, who shook her head, not knowing, but then pointed to one of the black glass windows set in a metal frame.  Curious, Sarah and I walked to the panel, and looked at it.  Angel approached as well, and with a thoughtful look, pushed a small button at the bottom right corner. <BR> <BR>Instantly, the black panel turned brighter, and letters I did not recognize displayed themselves.  Sarah made a thoughtful noise, and spoke slowly, &#39;8088.  Test...ing mem...ory.&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;You can read that?&#39;  I asked, motioning with my hand at this odd &#39;living picture&#39;. <BR> <BR>&#39;Well.  Mostly.  Just the syllables.  My father made me learn the old language.&#39;  Sarah replied, before continuing her reading.  &#39;Memory check...  Done.  Testing ...Data storage.  Done.  Um.  Not sure on this one.  What&#39;s DOS?&#39; <BR> <BR>We both looked at Angel, who looked just as puzzled as us. <BR> <BR>&#39;Loading DOS, ver...sion seven.&#39;  Sarah blinked, &#39;Run dia...g...nos...tic, on test sub...ject...  Zan?  Y/N&#39; <BR> <BR>We were just starting to puzzle over this, when a small panel opened up beside the glass window.  Under it, was a set of small square buttons, in a neat row, ten wide and twelve tall.  Each with a different symbol on it. <BR> <BR>Sarah, Angel and I all looked at each other with a &#39;hm, interesting&#39; look. <BR> <BR>&#39;Maybe if I found the...  Oh, here is Y.  And here is N.&#39;  Sarah said, pointing to two of the buttons.  &#39;Hm.  It has every letter in our alphabet, and numbers too.  And a few extra ones I have no idea about.&#39;  Sarah poked the Y button. <BR> <BR>The result was instantaneous.  The light behind the glass cleared of letters, then started showing new ones.  The liquid the black monster floated in bubbled slightly, and the base of the glass tube started to hum quietly.  Sarah started reading the letters aloud again.  &#39;Life...  Support.  Okay.  Sta...sis fluid.  Okay.  Power supply.  Okay.  Monster sta...tus.  Stable.  Pro...gram...ing.  100% complete.&#39;  A pause.  &#39;Run revival se...quence?  Y/N?&#39; <BR> <BR>Revive?  I had thought.  I was filled with feelings of joy.  Finally, I would get some answers.  The &#39;dark dirty secret&#39; would finally be revealed.  &#39;Yes.&#39;  I said to Sarah. <BR> <BR>She pushed the &#39;Y&#39; button.  And the screen flashed again.  &#39;Init...iat...ing revival se...quence.&#39; <BR> <BR>The liquid in the glass tube started to drain out the bottom with a great rush of bubbles.  The white circles coming off the skin of the monster and hanging from the top of the tube.  After the liquid drained away, leaving only the monster, now standing on the bottom, the glass retracted itself into the ceiling.  But the monster did not move.  Did not seem to breath.  Did nothing but stand there, its armored looking body so smooth that it appeared dry, despite its long submersion.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Now what?&#34;  I asked nobody in particular.  &#34;Its out of the, what ever it was.  But...?&#34; <BR> <BR>Sarah and I stared at the black monster, wondering what to do, when Angel stepped in front of me, and with those same sad eyes, handed me a single piece of paper. <BR> <BR>&#39;Ask it.&#39; <BR> <BR>I blinked, I remember looking at the bit of paper as if it was about to devour my hand, yet my eye contact held it at bay.  This entire trek, Angel had been set against it.  Never hindering our progress, but wishing it would not have to happen.  This was the ancients &#39;dirty little secret&#39;, and Angel was giving it to me. <BR> <BR>My gaze was forcibly moved from the paper, when the ground shook.  Then again, and again, the walls shook, as if some great fist was pounding the walls of the great temple itself.  Angel, Sarah and myself we brought to our knees, yet the statue-like Zan was completely unmoved.  Some thing was trying to get into the shrine. <BR> <BR>Dust came down in a gently cascade as another shake reverberated around us. <BR> <BR>&#34;Miki!  Hurry up!  Wake it up so we can get out of here.  Something wants in, and they don&#39;t seem to care if the place is standing when they enter!&#34;  Sarah spoke quickly, bracing herself against one of the odd desks and standing, Angel helping her. <BR> <BR>&#34;Just ask?&#34;  I said to myself as another shiver went through the building.  &#34;Zan!  I ask that you awaken!  Help us!&#34;  At first nothing happened, and a wisp of memory from my dream bubbled in the back of my mind, &#34;Catalyst Angel, gives you permission!&#34; <BR> <BR>Angel looked up at the mention of her name, and squeaked as the building shook again.  The three of us noticed a subtle change in Zan.  It was if it was suddenly...  Aware.  Alive.  The biggest shock yet hit the building, and we heard the sound of a stone crashing to the ground in another room.  This shock brought Zan to one knee, the long arms on his back spreading for balance. <BR> <BR>And then I FELT his presence.  Two unreflective black eyes focused on me, and I felt my mouth go dry.  &#34;Miki!  Hurry!&#34;  Sarah screamed, shocking my frozen wits into motion again. <BR> <BR>Looking into those deadly black eyes, I spoke.  &#34;Come with us.  We must leave, quickly.&#34; <BR> <BR>I felt the ground shake again, not as hard this time, and then Angel holding onto my left arm.  She looked at Zan, then tugged my arm towards the way we had come, Sarah already there, waving frantically. <BR> <BR>Angel and I ran towards the door, pausing briefly to make sure Zan was following.  I almost stumbled as I saw it was almost right behind me, silent feet matching my pace exactly. <BR> <BR>Running back the way we came, the vibrations started again.  Harder this time, more stones crashing down, thankfully in other parts of the shrine, but that would not last long, as we could see the walls were starting to split subtly.  Sarah was leading by a couple paces, making our way back to the room we had slept in.  &#34;The book!  We have to get the book!&#34;  She shouted over the crashing of rocks and splitting stone. <BR> <BR>We were almost at the room, when the hallway wall just before us ruptured inwards.  A great cloud of dust filled the hallway as we all skidded to a halt.  Forms began to take shape in the smoke.  One large, another small, then a third, human. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh ho!&#34; Called an arrogant sounding voice.  &#34;I finally find the temple, and break into it.  And I find the place already subject to thieves.&#34; <BR> <BR>Slowly the smoke cleared somewhat, revealing what looked like a golem, completely made of clear ice, and what looked like something out of a nightmare.  Holding a giant scythe, and wearing a grim mask fashioned into what looked like a skull, floated an empty black cape and tunic. <BR> <BR>&#34;Elebus, Joker.  Kill the boy and the black thing.  Try and keep the Angel and girl alive.&#34;  The arrogant voice stepped forward, revealing a man, perhaps in his mid twenties.  A little taller than my five-nine, his face was handsome, lean and sharp.  A shock of deep blue hair matched his dark blue and silver overcoat and cape.  Reminded me of royalty.  For a war lord, at least.  He even had a sword, long and thin, wearing it at his left hip. <BR> <BR>With a nod, the two monsters stepped/floated forward. <BR> <BR> <BR>======= <BR>Whew.  This is getting a little awkward to write.  HAving a little trouble getting the words to flow with this last section.  Sorry if it isnt what you expected. <BR> <BR>Anyhow.  here it is.  ^_^

 Too short, but still, as always, well written.

 I forgot what happened again, lol, so I head to read over part 15. It&#39;s getting very interesting now, I&#39;m starting to wonder what&#39;s going to happen next.
