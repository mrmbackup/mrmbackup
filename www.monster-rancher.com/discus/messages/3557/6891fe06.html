 On the way to the mountains Demon and I had to explain what was going on to Sakura,and since it was a long walk we discussed what we would do next. <BR>&#34;We&#39;re here.&#34;Demon said calmly when we arrived. <BR>We were certainly there.There was a small hole,but once we crawled through it it was huge.I lit some candles so we could see everything.The walls were wet,and so was the floor and we decided not to stay there long. <BR>A couple of days went by.The town had found out about the murder of course and they knew it was me.Sakura was getting strong and fast.She already had a new technique,that she aquired when training with Demon.She was very smart to.And I would soon be grateful that I had her on my team. <BR>&#34;Hey!Look at this!&#34;Sakura shouted with joy as she raised a disc in the air. <BR>&#34;Where did you find that disc?&#34;I asked in an excited voice. <BR>&#34;Over there.In the corner.Can we unlock it?&#34;Sakura asked. <BR>&#34;Well...........We would have to go to the next village since this one is searching for us.&#34;I replied. <BR>&#34;Then lets go,but only if she&#39;ll walk.I&#39;m not going to carry her again.&#34;Demon said. <BR>&#34;Sure&#34; <BR>So we headed out.The villages don&#39;t talk to each other much.Only at monster battles,so the word about the murder shouldn&#39;t have spread there yet. <BR>Sakura got much stronger from the walk.Her wings got stronger too.She liked to fly in the trees.Demon got stronger too.He got really good at climbing,because Sakura got stuck in the trees alot,and he had to get her down.We made a good team though.We encountered a pack of wild zuums but we easily desposed of them.I was proud of my monsters.They were the only ones I could trust,or so I thought. <BR>We finally got to the next town.Everyone thought Sakura was cute,and the trainers thought she was weak.She changed their minds very quickly.Some trainers were gloating about how they&#39;re monsters could beat Sakura easily.So, we challenged them to a battle and there were enough of them to make it into a tournament,but they only fought Sakura.She beat all of them easily enough and had no trouble. <BR>&#34;Wow your monster is great!&#34;One of the trainers said. <BR>&#34;Of course she is.My cabalos is even better.But any monster of mine could defeat your weak and pitiful monsters&#34;I said,and with that we went to the shrine. <BR>We opened the disc,and inside was a draco hopper. <BR>&#34;Hello!I will name you Ricon.&#34;I said. <BR>&#34;Good.Then it&#39;s Ricon.What is your name?&#34;Ricon asked. <BR>&#34;My name is Micah.&#34;I said.&#34;Come we must go.&#34; <BR>We walked out of the village with a plan.We told Ricon our story and then we left.Ricon was strong and probably could have been in &#39;c&#39; class at his very birth.We thought we would go to the woods and find a place to sleep.We found alot more than that............ <BR> <BR>To Be Continued................
