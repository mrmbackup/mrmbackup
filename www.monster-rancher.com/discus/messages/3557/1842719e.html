 Chapter 18:A Desperate Strike... <BR> <BR>&#40;This one came out shorter the my usual but I hope you all find it entertaining.&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Stone Claw&#39;s gray eyes narrowed as the machine guns trained on them. This was it...the end. No longer was it a question of wether or not they&#39;d live, but how many of the Masters freaks could they destroy before being killed themselves. A thousand thoughts flashed through the Tridents mind as he raised his energy filled hands, Shielka and Beatdown growing tense as they stood beside him. A sudden wave of regret hit him as he realized the two would die as well...He wondered, in that moment, if there was any chance at all to save them, and perhaps himself. In the end it was clear, only a miracle could save them now. As the energy shots left his hands and sped towards the battle hengers he quickly pushed the thoughts back. He was never one to care very much for any living thing...and this was a bad time to start....... <BR> <BR>The dual energy shots exploded, just as the first wave of bullets slammed from the hengers guns. Several were destroyed in it&#39;s wake, the others staggered back because of the blasts force. Suddenly Beatdown sped forward in the confusion, engaging the slower machines with her lightening fast techniques, clearing a path for Shielka. &#39;So far so good&#39; Claw thought as he launched more shots to keep the hengers at bay, they retaliated with a spray of hot lead, forcing him to duck behind a large computer. Meanwhile Shielka sped forward like a bolt of flame, a sphere of power in hand. She hurled it at the massive energy core at close range, on impact it would destroy the power supply and send the Raven crashing down. To Stone claw it seemed an eternity passed as he watched...waiting, as the sphere floated from the daina&#39;s hand. After all, when it hit...they were dead. <BR> <BR>That never came to pass, as a huge hand shot up suddenly, slapping the sphere away from the core. Surprised, Shielka was unable to dodge as it screamed toward her. There was an explosion indeed, only it was hardly the core which was struck down. The daina&#39;s body fell from the air, hitting the metal floor with a sickening thud. She bleed all over, body scared and bruised terribly.  Her wings were completely mangled, the membranes torn ragged and the actual bones broken. She lay lifeless, her breathing faint... <BR> <BR>&#34;Shielka...&#34;Claw hissed, looking a her unmoving form and then shooting a glance at her assailant. They had forgotten about Flood, the Pressure. Flood who was totally unfazed by the energy shots...who&#39;s hand effortlessly slapped away the deadly sphere. The Trident glared at him, his anger growing to unseen heights. If he was thinking rationally he might have questioned the sudden explosion of vengefulness, he&#39;d only just met the daina. But that never truly crossed his mind...all he saw was Flood, and shielka&#39;s battered form. Beatdown was still busy fighting off the remaining Hengers and dodging there guns. <BR> <BR>&#34;Trident, lay down and die....&#34;The usually silent Flood spoke,&#34;You...are no match for me.&#34; The monster took a single step forward, his weight rocking the entire floor. A mix of golem and Zilla...few monsters could possibly be more physically intimidating. The thing was a damned wall of stone, backed by the awesome strength of the largest of monsters, what chance did Claw have? <BR> <BR>Stone claw slid forward in challenge, his aforementioned talons glinting in the dim light. He cared not for any disadvantage...his fury had reached the boiling point.... <BR> <BR>Without warning he lunged forward with speed and agility no monster that was half golem should possess. He viciously raked his claws against his enemies head and torso. Flood staggered, not expecting such a sudden, brutal and animalistic attack. Claw just tore into his stone flesh as though he was gutting a fish. Swipe after swipe doing great harm to the slower golem type. Claw continued his barrage, not letting up for a single moment, focusing all his anger into each deadly blow....at last Flood fell backward in a pool of blue slime which oozed from his wounds. <BR> <BR>Exhausted, Claw turned to beatdown, who had finished the last of the hengers and now stood misty eyed next to the barely breathing shielka. Claw slid beside her, but stopped suddenly as he heard Floods voice... <BR> <BR>&#34;Master...I call upon your power...Regenerate.&#34; <BR> <BR>By the time Claw had swung his bulk around to face the fallen golem he was no longer on the ground...Flood had risen, his wounds totally healed, he cracked his massive knuckles as he approached with lumbering steps. <BR> <BR>&#34;That was good....I will enjoy this.&#34; Flood said as he grabbed Claw and tosses his body to the hard floor. Beatdown was effortlessly backhanded out of the picture before the pressure returned his gaze to Claw, raining a single devastating blow on the tridents chest. Keep in mind, that Stone claw was no longer protected in that area, his stone armor chipped away by bullets. The force of the blow hit him like a thousand pound weight, forcing blood to fly from his mouth. A second fist rocked him right after, smashing the fallen Trident straight through the floor.... <BR> <BR>Claw fell a short ways, landing in what looked like a sterilized sewer. Water was being channeled through a tunnel, the purpose unknown. He simply floated for a minute, nearly unconscious, the wounds in his chest had begun to bleed again. As he came to his senses he realized the sheer pain his body was in. A moment later Flood leaped down to join him, causing a wave that sent Claw against the tunnels wall. Flood charged, grabbing him and slamming claw into the wall again...and again, taking great delight with each blow. When he grew bored the pressure hurled the limp Trident twenty feet, landing hard in the freezing water. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now...do you see?&#34;Flood asked. &#34;If you can not beat a warrior of the master....how can you defeat the master himself....your failure is inevitable...hahaha.&#34; <BR> <BR>Stone claw&#39;s eyes narrowed as he shot up from the water...&#34;Shut Up!!&#34; He screamed, using the last of his strength to perform a deadly drill attack. The tip of his tail drilled deep into Floods skull and once again the monster fell. Claw waited for a second, the water washing the blood from his tail. He breathed a sigh of relief that was all too premature...as the pressure was resurrected in front of his eyes. Claw noticed the symbol glowing on the beasts shoulder...the dreaded eye of the master. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why won&#39;t you die??&#34;Claw hissed, exhausted, pained but ready to fight too the death. Flood laughed darkly, easily slapping Claw against the wall and raining blow after blow into his chest. Stone claw was helpless, too tired and hurt to defend or counter, besides it would do no good. It was perhaps the single worst beating claw would ever have to endure. The world grew dim as his ribs began to snap one by one, the next punch would drive them into his heard and lungs... <BR> <BR>&#34;Flood.....&#34;Said a voice behind them. Flood turned around in alarm and was shocked to see Shielka standing there. Beatdown stood right behind her. The Daina leaned weakly against the wall to support herself, berely able to stand. Simply saying the name &#39;Flood&#39; took great energy. Flood laughed at her, she was in no condition to fight him. This was too easy... <BR> <BR>&#34;Former commander...Did the master not give me the greatest gift?&#34;Flood sneered at her. &#34;Thanks to it...I am nearly invincible.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You forget Flood.....yours was not the only gift.&#34; Shielka said, placing her hand around the golden symbol. &#34;Dark Fyre....&#34; With those words her body exploded in a surge of flame, creating a blinding flash...All present were forced to avert their eyes, and when they looked back they did not see shielka. Floating there, a few inches off the waters surface was a being of pure flame, only vaguely resembling the daina who once stood there. Before Flood could react she launched herself forward, transforming into a fiery bolt, flaming tendrils wiping around her...She passed through the pressure, cutting through him like butter. As she returned to her normal, injured self the fire was still burning inside of him. Flood had only enough time to look down at the whole in his chest before exploding, his powerful body reduced to fish flavored kibble. Beatdown slogged through the water, grabbing the master symbol and tossing it into the air. She assaulted it with a dragon kick, shattering it forever....Flood wasn&#39;t coming back this time. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah! Alright! Take that!!&#34;She splashed happily in the water, throwing punches a imaginary enemies. Claw, though barely conscious, found himself chuckingly at the little fairyhare. He dragged himself over to Shielka, who lay floating in the water, too tired to move. She turned her head, managing a weak smile. He glanced up at the hole above, it seemed so far away now. His battered body screamed for an end to this madness... <BR> <BR>&#34;At least we tried....&#34;He said weakly. The daina shook her head slowly, somehow finding the strength to stand up. <BR> <BR>&#34;After all this...we can&#39;t let it end here.&#34;She looked up at the hole. &#34;We&#39;ve got to keep going. You&#39;ve pushed me this far Stone claw...I guess now it&#39;s my turn. Now get up.&#34; <BR> <BR>Stone claw gave her an angry glare, forcing himself up, his blood still running into the clear water. It was hard to move, difficult to even breath, but somehow he found the strength as well. He realized she was right, after all this, he couldn&#39;t lay down and die...not yet. &#34;I&#39;ll give you two a boost, get movin....&#34; <BR> <BR>Ten minutes later all three had managed to climb back into the energy chamber, but something was wrong. The core had indeed been damaged during the battle earlier and red lights were flashing...Suddenly the black Raven shook violently, a message flashed onscreen that read: &#40;Warning fifty percent power loss, primary weapon disabled, flight disabled. Diverting all power to vital systems...&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;The weapons are offline...&#34;Shielka said, holding her head as a sudden wave of dizziness wash over her,&#34;And that means their going to come down here to find out what went wro- <BR> <BR>&#34;Freeze traitor!&#34;The trio looked toward the door and saw the salamander Zarzaas. Behind him was an small army of battle hengers about to open fire...Stone claw wasted no time, grabbing shielka and beatdown by their arms and moving towards the other door. He knew they wouldn&#39;t fire in this direction or risk hitting the core. Besides, if the weapons were down there was a chance...a chance to get out of here alive.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Quick, where does this lead?&#34;He hissed in urgency. Shielka looked at the door, meant to be used as an escape route in emergencies. Before, the red alert status of the ship had sealed the door tightly. Now that there was a power outage the huge metal door could be moved... <BR> <BR>&#34;It leads up,&#34;She smiled wearily, a drop of blood slipping down from her cheek and landing on the floor&#34;We can....get outside.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Lot of good that&#39;ll do...&#34;Claw hissed once again as his body strained to push the door aside. Beatdown looks at them each in turn, great concern in her eyes. <BR> <BR>&#34;You guys need a doctor.&#34;She blurted out as claw finally got the door open. By that time he felt ready to collapse, but the pursuing hengers allowed no time to rest. At least now there was hope, dim and fleeting but it was there. There just might be a way to escape after all...&#34;We&#39;ll find a way off this bird, lets go.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>In the command center of the floating fortress Justice, Celine and Ganthor waited patiently beside there enemy, and temporary ally Moo. They watched as the deadly energy surged at the head of the raven, which prepared once again to utter it&#39;s terrible song. But this time the fortress would not hold out, they were waiting for there own deaths. As the beam prepared to reduce them to atoms, Justice silently prayed to his trainer, wishing he could have avenged his murder...and now after coming so far...it must end like this. The great dragon Moo waited as well, his eyes narrow and hateful. The durahan wondered what Moo was thinking, perhaps the evil one was still in shock at one simple fact...he&#39;d been defeated.  <BR> <BR>Then...as if by some bizarre miracle, the raven stopped charging, the energy fizzling and dieing before there eyes. The ravens cry did not come...Justice stood there, wondering if somehow they&#39;d been saved, something must have gone wrong inside the ship... <BR> <BR>Suddenly Moo burst out laughing, it was a horrible sound, a sound that made the bravest monster shutter in fear. Turning on his heel, Moo stomped up to the control panel and spoke into a strange device. <BR> <BR>&#34;All monsters capable of flight, prepare to attack!&#34;Moo said as another Weed took the place of the one he&#39;d eaten. He glared down at the cowardly monster. &#34;Do we have mobility??&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Y-y-yes master Moo!&#34;The Weed shouted. <BR> <BR>&#34;Good...Ram the enemy ship, do it now!&#34;Moo roared as he turned toward the window. They had indeed begun to move, speeding towards the Black Raven which seemed immobilized at the moment. Justice watched, gearing himself for the battle to come. He realized that they&#39;d been given an opening...This was their chance for one last strike...

 Hey Eagle! You haven&#39;t reviewed my last two chapters! It just doesn&#39;t feel right without you critizing my grammer.

 ROTFL...True, I haven&#39;t critisized much.  The only thing I can say is that it&#39;s a GREAT story...HOEVER, the grammar makes it a little difficult to read.  In fact, you don&#39;t even use the propper form of the word &#40;ex. sight could be spelled site or cite&#41;  Other than that, the plot was top-notch, as always, as well as the format and style.  I know that you write inthe heat of the moment, and it adds a great deal to the story, but it would help if oyu went back and checked over your work after you were finished reading it.  The grammar is the only major problem I see, BR.  Fix that, and you got one hectic epic that could draw just about anyone in.

 Ummm....Eagle....I hate&#40;not&#41; to rain on your parsde but, HOEVER? You might need to read over your post :0P. Razor, this one was great. I love the whole fight with the Pressure. I could actually invision it. As for the plot, you seem to be missing a bad guy that I haven&#39;t seen in a while. The Jaggernaught that hit Moo that time. He kinda disappeared. Ohh well, I can&#39;t complain to much. Overall: A great story with a SLIGHT prof-reading need.

 &#34;what i like best about this story&#34; <BR> <BR>by torey luvullo <BR> <BR>     what i like best about chapter 18 is something that chb complained about - the fact that br is confident enough in the power of his plot that characters and threads seem to disappear for awhile, only to reemerge later on down the pike.  the length of this epic, which sometimes can seem to drag, works in favor of the plot devices chosen by black razor here - the battles do not seem to be events in and of themselves so much as means to an end - every character is now familiar enough to be seen as having his/her own motivations, strengths and weaknesses. <BR> <BR>eagle&#39;s critique is of course right on, so i will omit the proofreading remark.  chb, there&#39;s a difference between &#34;publishing&#34; a story, and &#34;posting&#34; a comment, and stories are held by their readers to higher standards, whether they should be or not.

 I really like this story.  I think we should get a  <BR>publisher around here to publish a book  with  <BR>ALL the MR stories.  THAT&#39;LL get people  <BR>running again.  This story would be the main  <BR>attraction.
