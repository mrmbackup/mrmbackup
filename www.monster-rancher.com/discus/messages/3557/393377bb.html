 Galin stood solemnly on the roof of the jillish lab overlooking the great civilization under the mountain. Both pairs of his arms were crossed, and his wings draped over him in the style that he, like is father, was known and feared for. His body was present, but his thoughts drifted. Three hours now, since they put Roketh in that machine. An oxygen mask, several tubes were inserted. In the time since he had been back here, he had not regained consciousness. <BR> <BR>&#34;He&#39;ll wake you know.&#34; A burly voice came from behind Galin. <BR> <BR>Galin didn&#39;t answer for a while, but then said, &#34;I know.&#34; <BR> <BR>He stood there, knowing all too well who was behind him, &#34;Are you afraid of death? You&#39;re going to die soon. I just wanted to know if you were ready.&#34; <BR> <BR>A heavy laugh came from behind him as a large palm slapped him on the back, &#34;My boy, I&#39;ve been ready for years.&#34; Grendel stepped up beside him, watching over the massive city as he added; &#34;I&#39;ve done my share, and seen it, too.&#34; <BR> <BR>They two stood there, silent. Like massive, twin sentinels guarding the city. Galin wondered, when the time came, would he be ready? To sacrifice himself for the sake of another, or for a cause he deemed &#39;Just&#39; and &#39;Right&#39;? As Galin pondered, his thoughts were suddenly scattered by the large Jill once more. <BR> <BR>&#34;You know, I&#39;m not that scared at all. More nervous.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Why? Your doing this for a good reason, why nervous?&#34; Galin asked, finally turning his head to face the Jill. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, what is after this? If there is a God, would he show favor to me for my actions? Is it considered suicide? What if it&#39;s just dark? Your soul disappears?&#34; Grendel said, then he looked up at their artificial sun hanging in the top of the dome. <BR> <BR>Galin also looked up at it. Quite a feat, if he could say so himself. An exact replica of sunlight. <BR> <BR>&#34;But you miss the sunsets.&#34; Grendel said, seemingly out of nowhere, &#34;We got sunlight, but not much beauty to it.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What do you mean? For a wise man, you&#39;re awful insecure.&#34; Galin said with a grin, returning his gaze to Grendel. <BR> <BR>&#34;Your awful curious about death all of a sudden, are you afraid of death?&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin jerked with a slight laugh as he spoke, &#34;Terrified.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Har, har, but why, boy?&#34; Grendel asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why are you?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m not&#34;, Grendel answered, &#34;Just nervous.&#34; <BR> <BR>The two resumed the all too familiar silence about them. They stood there, for an awful long time before one of them spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;Galin, old chap,&#34; Grendel spoke softly, &#34;My time is up. It came and went and I loved every minute of it. If I could do it again, all the same, mistakes, faults, everything, I wouldn&#39;t change a bit of it. You see, I know it be my time, and I know my sacrifice is protecting all that I hold dear.&#34; As he spoke, he motioned his hand over the massive city, and Galin finally knew what he meant. <BR> <BR>Galin stood there, contemplating these words. As he did, Grendel began to walk off. The massive footsteps stopped suddenly, as he added, &#34;When it be time for you to choose your sacrifice, you&#39;ll know, and you won&#39;t be afraid. You&#39;re a strong lad, and you&#39;ll do what is right in your heart. But if you learn anything from an old monster&#39;s ramblings, let it be this Galin…&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin turned slightly, and looked the ancient Jill in his pure white eyes. He felt a feeling not natural to him, one he could not express or describe, but it was nice. A single tear rolled off Grendel&#39;s long, white mustache, as he spoke, &#34;Love the beauty of the world while you have it, and never miss a sunset.&#34; <BR> <BR>Grendel turned and exited, leaving Galin to his perch to work out his feelings alone, the best way he could. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile…downstairs… <BR> <BR> <BR>The war room was nearly empty. Only three Jills still wondered about, watching screens and playing virtual chess. Moonshadow had long since went to sleep one the floor, curled up the way most Tigers sleep. Dadge sat at the main screen, feet propped up, hands behind his head. The Blood Clover was beside the large, solitary chamber that Roketh was in. They figured he&#39;d be safer under the eyes of the war room staff. The egg-like structure was filled with a blue liquid. They had set Roketh&#39;s wing and, using lasers and assorted other technology, put his ligaments back in the proper places. It was up to the Dragon&#39;s rejuvenation process that would determine how well everything healed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well bud, we come a long way.&#34; Dadge said to the capsule, &#34;And I finally learned what happened to Jace and Vyger. That Nightmare, he and his gang got theirs though, and a good thing that is.&#34; <BR> <BR>He glanced back at the sleeping Dragon, almost realizing his denseness at talking to a tube. He looked back at the main screen. After Grendel, it will be two left, Fire and Good. He brought up the specs on the Lord of Fire, Blazemost. <BR> <BR>Not the typical Phoenix. It talked about it being a terror at some erranty or another. They referred to him only as The Blue Phoenix. <BR> <BR>Dadge studied his stats for a bit. He then noticed a small, flashing button at the bottom of the screen. It said, &#34;Visual!&#34;, and continued to flash red. Dadge was curious and, after glancing about to make sure no one was looking, he pressed it. <BR> <BR>Dadge assumed a small box would appear devoid of sound. However, the image went full screen as the sound of battle rang through the control room. Moonshadow bounded to his feet, as the other Jills like to have fallen over from the startle. Dadge looked up at the giant monitor, a volcano? It seemed to be erupting. On further observation, he realized that Blazemost was doing battle on top of it. He was fighting something quite fast, but it kind of resembled a Joker. <BR> <BR>About this time, Grendel came barging downstairs, &#34;What did I tell you ignorant Jills about watching Godzilla flicks on the big screen!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Wasn&#39;t us, sir, but look!&#34; One of them spoke. <BR> <BR>All eyes were on the battle as it raged. Both went at incredible speed, and explosions flew of the crag is seemingly all directions. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, Roketh or no, looks like were heading to that battle field.&#34; A voice spoke. As they turned, they saw Galin tightening his gloves, &#34;What are yeah waiting for? We got a cause now,&#34; As he spoke he looked at Grendel and winked, &#34;And I&#39;d sure hate to miss that sunset.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>-Looks like Galin and the others get to face their next battle without the mighty Roketh. Can they handle this new threat? Can they get there in time to assist Blazemost, Lord of Fire? You don&#39;t want to miss the next chapter, I assure you.- <BR> <BR> <BR>Stay Tuned! CHB <BR> <BR>P.S. I know the title is a bit deceiving this time but trust me, the next few chapters are going to be a lot like the battle with Nightmare &#40;1st round&#41; So don&#39;t miss it. Plus, anyone that knows me knows that whenever I have a plot builder like this, things are about to get messy. I must also apologize for its shortness.

 i know you have to give the people what they want.  however, imo, it is &#34;breathing spaces&#34; like this and the previous chapter, that make this epic powerful.
