 I really like this poem. It wasn&#39;t supposed to rhyme, but in some areas it does. It illustrates a good message, and involves one of my favorite monsters. It&#39;s kinda long, but definetely worth it! <BR> <BR>The Sorrow of One <BR> <BR>I fly but not through the clouds, <BR>I walk but not on the ground, <BR>To fly and be all I can be, <BR>But a dream for all of time. <BR> <BR>To fly up through the sky, as a Phoenix <BR>Would be all I ever wanted. <BR>To splash into a cool current is what I wish <BR>But only I hover above it. <BR> <BR>I had a dream to one day soar, <BR>To float above the lithosphere. <BR>Dancing through the clouds, so close, <BR>Yet so far away, an endless journey. <BR> <BR>I long to feel the smooth blades of grass, <BR>Dancing through fields of flowers, <BR>If only I could soak in the mud, <BR>That I cannot achieve. <BR> <BR>I long to leave this place one day, <BR>An abyss in which I am bound. <BR>To soar through clouds, to feel the earth, <BR>Something I cannot achieve. <BR> <BR>Between mud and air, <BR>Sky and grass <BR>I yearn for an escape, <BR>An escape from the prison that is my life. <BR> <BR>I levitate home, not walk nor fly, <BR>Just a hover, above the ground. <BR>To be, one day, a happy soul, <BR>While I am feared and despised by all. <BR> <BR>I am a Joker, not walking nor soaring, <BR>Levitating, hovering, not even gliding, <BR>On my way home, <BR>I am not content with my life. <BR> <BR>I walk, no, hover towards my home, <BR>I alone, with none to share my sorrow, <BR>Walk into the darkness that is my life, <BR>The darkness that is a Joker&#39;s life. <BR> <BR>I walk along, and hear a sound,  <BR>A sound like no other sound, <BR>Cheer, joy, happiness too, <BR>Traits I have long forgotten. <BR> <BR>I take a peek, a quick little look, <BR>And don’t believe my eyes, <BR>No, my mask, <BR>Others like me, having a good time. <BR> <BR>I watch, in awe, as they prance around, <BR>Even though they don’t touch the ground, <BR>Yet cannot soar, cannot fly, <BR>Reasons why I wish to die. <BR> <BR>They laugh and play, and soon I see, <BR>They are happy, others, others like me. <BR>I watch them, not a care in the world, <BR>And soon I see it, why not before? <BR> <BR>Who cares if I have no ground or sky, <BR>I live in my own domain. <BR>I am a Joker, yes, a Joker not meant to fly, <BR>I am content now, and join my new found friends. <BR> <BR>They laugh and play, and so do I, <BR>I realize now my mistakes. <BR>The abyss was not of my life, <BR>But of my own doing, my own prison I have now escaped. <BR> <BR>The mind can be the stronest prison of all. Some will not escape for their entire lives. Think happy thoughts, and be all you can be! -Icelord13

 Hey, not bad, I don&#39;t usually go for free verse. It isn&#39;t shabby  at all.

 Cool. I tries to go for a theme here. Like, cherish what you have, not what you don&#39;t. I liked this one when I wrote it.

 Thanks gw. If you like these that much, you should read my other stuff. I have the song out in Filk Songs, Zip Shine, The MDA in epics in progress, Open Wounds in epics in progress, and two storys in the non monster rancher section. Anyway, i&#39;ll be sure to write more.

 Oh, and to answer your question, my other poems are &#34;one of the newest monsters, ripper&#34; , &#34;madillo limerick&#34;, and the &#34;jells&#34; one.

Heeeey! I love het message you are trying to put across, and it is so true, as well. The mind really is the strongest prison. I never thought of a Joker being depressed that it floats, but cannot fly. That would be kind of depressing. I love all of your writing. I sincerely hope that you stay prolific in your writing, <B>and</B> that they stay pieces of art. Well done, b&#123;well done}!

 Thanks for all the comments guys. If you liked this that much, i guess i could try some more free verse. This poem was kinda like an experiment fer me. I&#39;m glad it came out okay!
