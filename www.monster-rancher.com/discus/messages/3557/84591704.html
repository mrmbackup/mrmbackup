 Disclaimer: Uh...... Same as last time. With  <BR>that said, on with the story! <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter One <BR>The Curse of Darkness <BR>	 <BR>	Lunar sped on, He knew that there was an  <BR>evil Elemental behind him and the Light  <BR>Elemental in front of him. If he could get to the  <BR>Elemental that lay before him he would be  <BR>able to take on the other Elementals, He was  <BR>so busy running and keeping his senses  <BR>tuned to the Light Elemental he stumbled right  <BR>through a tribe of Fire Wolves, One of the  <BR>many variations of Fire Elementals, these  <BR>creatures liked to hunt in packs of 20 or 30.  <BR>He never even noticed when a blast of fire just  <BR>barely missed him. He was that devoted to  <BR>tracking the Elemental ahead. All of a sudden  <BR>one jumped in front of him and he skid to a  <BR>halt. The creature spoke in growly version of   <BR>the animal language. “What do we have  <BR>hear?” He questioned. Lunar never even  <BR>paused, He unsheathed his claws and  <BR>rammed them in to the Fire Wolf’s snout! The  <BR>Wolf yelped and the others closed in on  <BR>Lunar. “That was your worst mistake cat! You  <BR>will pay for touching Flaming Alpha!” One said  <BR>menacingly. “Well who was he to get in my  <BR>way?” Lunar challenged. “He was the Alpha of  <BR>all Fire Wolves!” Another replied. Lunar then  <BR>knew what he had got himself in to. He had  <BR>just rammed four inches of claw up a Kings  <BR>nose! But he held up a brave front. “Well do  <BR>you know who I am?” He asked. “A lowly  <BR>normal cat!” The spokes-wolf replied. “Wrong!  <BR>I am the Ruler of the Water Cats!” He lied. The  <BR>Water Cats were a rare but formable species  <BR>and everybody knew it. “I don’t believe you. So  <BR>can you prove it?” The wolf questioned. Lunar  <BR>was up against a brick wall and he knew it. If  <BR>he were to survive this and beat the enemy  <BR>Elemental to the ally Elemental he would have  <BR>to hurry. <BR>	 <BR>	The Dark Elemental sensed something, His  <BR>target &#40;Lunar&#41; had stopped moving. He almost  <BR>rejoiced but that wouldn’t have been Darkish  <BR>now would it? He was currently in the shape  <BR>of a human warlock but decided to switch to  <BR>demon form for this. He started to morph and  <BR>became taller, then sprouted wings then  <BR>fangs and finally his eyes turned red, he was  <BR>a Demon. He continued on, about..... well, very  <BR>fast and within the hour came to the tribe. <BR>	 <BR>	Lunar looked at the Dark Elemental with fear  <BR>in his eyes. He had never before encountered  <BR>a Dark Elemental and had always hoped he  <BR>never would. The Wolves saw how he was  <BR>looking scared and thought it was because of  <BR>them. The spokes-wolf bragged “Why do you  <BR>looked so scared cat?” He questioned.  <BR>“Maybe it because you just realized what  <BR>we’ve known all along! That you can’t mess  <BR>with Fire Wolves!” He opened his mouth and  <BR>started chanting as his mouth filled with fire:  <BR>“Fire, burn bright! Fire, to my foes set light!  <BR>FIRE!” The fire started to descend towards  <BR>Lunar, but before it could get there the Wolf cut  <BR>it off with a gurgling sound. He was choking!  <BR>Lunar looked towards the Dark Elemental and  <BR>saw that its hand was pointing towards the  <BR>Wolf’s throat and making a  motion as though  <BR>his hand was closing on the Wolf’s throat and  <BR>choking him. Lunar was frightened and  <BR>wanted to get out of there as quickly as  <BR>possible. He started to run but the Dark  <BR>Elemental noticed him and motioned with a  <BR>hand. A flash came out of it and hurtled  <BR>towards Lunar. Lunar saw it and tried to  <BR>dodge but was clipped on the side by the  <BR>flash. The Dark Elemental was disappointed,  <BR>had the flash hit him full on he would of died  <BR>but instead he got clipped, cursed. Lunar ran,  <BR>he ran as fast as he could. He only wished to  <BR>be away from that place where a massive  <BR>slaughter was taking place. He got to a cave  <BR>that night and decided to sleep there. It wasn’t  <BR>actually a cave but the curse made him see it  <BR>as one. He slept there for the night, right next  <BR>to a huge Bear of the Earth! A Bear of the Earth  <BR>is a rare and, luckily for Lunar, rather well  <BR>tempered and docile creature. When Lunar  <BR>woke up the curse was more active then ever.  <BR>Not only was he seeing things but his ability to  <BR>sense was giving off false alarms! Not that he  <BR>knew that, because he saw everything he  <BR>expected to see and nothing that he didn’t. He  <BR>ran and ran and ran, always trying to get away  <BR>from figments of his imagination. He saw the  <BR>rarest and most exotic of creatures, But he  <BR>was always pursued by bad dreams of the  <BR>Dark Elemental chasing him. He was  <BR>delirious and saw whatever he thought of,  <BR>whether he wanted to see it or not.  <BR>	After 3 days it started to wear off. He started to  <BR>see tiny bits of reality through his vision. When  <BR>the curse had subsided enough he could see  <BR>completely. However his special sense still  <BR>gave off false alarms. He woke one morning  <BR>to find himself outside a cave, he had a  <BR>strange feeling that he should enter. He did  <BR>so and found himself standing before a griffin.  <BR>The griffin spoke: “ The chosen one is a cat?  <BR>Well cat, sorry, Lunarsword. You are obviously  <BR>the chosen one so I shall turn you in to a  <BR>magic creature, One that can help the capturer  <BR>of the crystals.” “Hold on!” said Lunar quickly.  <BR>“Who are you? And what’s this about  <BR>changing me in to something else? Only the  <BR>Light Elemental can do that and you’re not  <BR>the... Hey! Why can’t I say it?” The griffin spoke  <BR>“You cannot tell untruth near a griffin, there for  <BR>I must be the Light Elemental!” Lunar replied  <BR>quickly “Fine! You can change me in to a  <BR>different creature but only if I like it!’ The griffin  <BR>replies “Deal! How about an attractive human  <BR>in a pink blouse?” Lunar made a face. The  <BR>griffin proposed another “Fine. How about an   <BR>attractive human in a pink blouse with wings?”  <BR>He asked with a funny wink. Lunar pulled  <BR>faces “Fine.” The griffin said quickly “ How  <BR>about a cat with claws that are a foot long?”  <BR>Lunar looked at him, amazed at the craziness  <BR>of the idea, “How about I give one?” He asked.  <BR>The griffin agreed grudgingly “Okay, here’s an  <BR>idea. How ‘bout a flying cat, my size with a  <BR>gem on its forehead and an arsenal of  <BR>devastating spells?” The griffin agreed  <BR>“Sounds fair! You are not cured of the curse  <BR>that you were hit by but I have contained it for  <BR>you. If you still were affected by it it might  <BR>mess up the magic. Be careful for it can be  <BR>reactivated” A strange cloud lowered over  <BR>Lunar and when it rose a very strange cat  <BR>remained.... <BR> <BR> <BR>Feed back is very much appreciated!
