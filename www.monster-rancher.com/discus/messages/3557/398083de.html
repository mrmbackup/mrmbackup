 Roketh stared about him. A field? How was he here? Lush green rolled across the landscape. The wind seemed to ripple across the top of the long grass. The grass was well up to his hips, slowly brushing up his leg and his wings. Roketh lowered his hand into the green that seemed to caress his scales. He smiled slightly; removing his massive claws from the soft beauty as it almost waved at him. He looked up to see a flock of geese in the customary V formation. They fly passed the sunrays that fell to the earth on this wondrous day. The beams reflected off the wings of the geese as they occasionally flapped. This was possibly the most perfect setting Roketh had ever been in, save one thing, him. Roketh stood out of this tranquil picture as a rough, battered figure. <BR> <BR>He looked over himself, and was amazed. The wound in his arm had healed, not even leaving a scar. He out-stretched his wings to their full capacity, and marveled at them. His leathery wing had also rejuvenated itself back perfectly. He thought he&#39;d never fly again, because even if it did heal, who could say that it would heal properly? Now, the question reemerged, along with another. &#34;How did I get here? Who fixed me so nice? It is almost like, nothing ever happened.&#34; <BR> <BR>Before he thought much more of it, something lashed out and entwined his right arm. He looked on in terror as a blade of the thick grass tethered around his biceps. He attempted to rip it off with his left hand but, as he grasped the weed, another shot from his left, encasing that arm in several blades. He struggled to free himself, to no avail. The vines began to slowly crawl up his legs, holding him in place. Three had already wound about his neck. The winding didn&#39;t stop there, as one shot up above his eyes, pulling his head back. Roketh&#39;s thoughts were frantic and far between. He decided on a sure-fire way to get out of this mess, or so he thought. <BR> <BR>He scorched all the grass about him, desperately trying to kill the source of these vicious vines. Anyone that has gone camping or has a general knowledge of fires should know that green grass doesn&#39;t burn easy, and this was obviously no ordinary grass. Roketh saw he did little more than make the grass smoke, yet he breathed on. Finally, a vine bound his mouth shut. Roketh still tried, only scorching the back of his teeth as fire licked out from between them like a tongue composed entirely of flame. <BR> <BR>As a vine wrapped around his tail, Roketh was finally forced to a knee. Struggle as he might, he knew it was futile at this point. He was captured by an unknown culprit, and would now be interrogated or die, probably both. He fought the plant still as he looked about for the one who controlled it to show itself. None came. The sky had turned an eerie shade of a purple horizon with a black sky. Roketh was in a field, but this field also had trees all around the end of it, like a border. He never noticed them before, were they there before? Then, a faint glow illuminated the sky directly in front of him. He watched as the light grew brighter and brighter, its orange reflection pressing against the sky. Roketh&#39;s first thought was of a Phoenix, but they never get that bright. <BR> <BR>All of a sudden, a small column erupted out of the ground Roketh was over. The earth column stopped about ten feet from the ground, as Roketh&#39;s restraints let go. Roketh returned his gaze to the glow in the forest. Almost the same instance he gazed at the mighty trees, something struck him in the back, hard. He turned and saw a goose flying down on him. It looked normal, but quickly Roketh saw the beast&#39;s true form. The long, thin neck grew grotesquely thick, as small spine-like projections sprang from it and down his back. The golden bill grew massive teeth, with two on the top jaw extending out a bit before dropping well bellow the bottom jaw. His eyes had begun to glow a fiery red. This was amplified as actual fire shot from them. The streams of flames rolled back over his head, which now had a demonic crescent upon it. The webbing on the creature&#39;s feet sunk back, disappearing completely. The feet were now more like a hawk or eagle. As you might have guessed, it no longer quacked. It roared a horrifically loud wail. Although it had indeed grown in size, it was still not even near as large as Roketh. What kind of demon was this? Roketh glanced at the other geese, who underwent a similar metamorphosis. However, each had different attributes, no two were identical. One had a horn, another grew two, gargoyle-like arms, and still another he noticed went as far the to rip its own head off, and out sprouted that of another. Roketh gasped as he recognized the face that attached to the long, serpent like neck. <BR> <BR>&#34;Kingston!&#34; Roketh said as he took a few steps back. His left ankle hit the edge of his platform, quickly stopping his retreat, but he never took his eyes off Kingston&#39;s mocking grin. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes! That I am! Now Roketh, prepare to feel the wrath of my dark master!&#34; As he spoke, he laughed hysterically. He also pointed one of his claw feet behind Roketh. <BR> <BR>Roketh turned and looked at the forest. Deer, fowl, bears, and assorted other animals came bounding out of the forest. The bright orange was right behind the tree-line now, as animals screamed at either their own suffering or at the lost of their family. Yet still they ran, faster and faster. Roketh was paralyzed with freight, feeling quite helpless. He watched in utter horror as hot lava slammed against the back of the gigantic trees, which offered little protection. The streams of liquid magma ran through the meadow, eating the grass and animals alike. Roketh actually noted a bear trying to climb the earth column. Roketh finally snapped out of it and lay flat on his stomach, outreaching his hand. Even if the bear realized what this gesture meant, I do believe he was too late anyway. The lava slammed into the back of the bear, which screamed with all the torment of anyone having the bottom half of their bodies burned off. His front two paws still clutched the rock, even after his death. Soon though, they let loose and the other half of the bear landed in the lava lake with a splash. Roketh stood up, feeling a deep rooted pain. He looked around him, for some reason, his platform did not melt. Why? He thought for only a moment, as the head of a sparrow went passed his face and into the molten rock. He looked up and was horrified. <BR> <BR>The birds had escaped the lava, but the winged demons in the sky were cutting them down for sport. Roketh screamed as he prepared to attack. Before he did, he heard a gut wrenching laugh and turned back the way that the lava had come from. <BR> <BR>A face? He could swear that, for an instance, he saw a face in the lava. He eyed the tree line, waiting for Kronock the show. Then he looked strait down at the lava. The putrid face of the contorted Kronock stared at him, chuckling. <BR> <BR>Then, an explosion of lava went strait into the now orange sky. Roketh fell on his back, and looked up in disbelief. Kronock stood there, more than ten times bigger than Roketh. Twice as high as the column to which Roketh was perched. The face looked down on him and laughed. It was a perfect resemblance to Kronock; even the body that formed was his. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ha! The world is mine, fool! You have failed, you failed them all!&#34; As he said this, he grasped his own chest with both hands, and parted it. Inside of Kronock himself, all of Roketh&#39;s ally&#39;s were. Even Denemaur, Bloodlust and Azurian were there. Galin and Moonshadow, even Jace and Vyger. They were all there, and each of them was on some form of medieval torture device. Their voices were vague and weary, but they defiantly called for him. They begged for his help, yet Roketh could only lie on his back, staring. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; Roketh said as tears began to fill his eyes, &#34;I failed.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kronock let out a massive laugh as he closed his chest cavity, then he said, &#34;Yes! You failed. With your failure comes my conquest! However, one detail is still left undone.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh eyes widen as the massive Kronock arched his back and raised his hands laughing louder than ever, &#34;Let the feast begin!&#34; <BR> <BR>Kronock opened his mouth, which was more than enough for Roketh to fit into, and dove at the helpless Dragon. Kronock devoured the entire column of rock as he plunged back into the lava. <BR> <BR>Meanwhile…In the city of the Jill… <BR> <BR>&#34;Get him something now! Calm him before he breaks the glass!&#34; Grendel screamed as he stared into Roketh&#39;s chamber, &#34;If he keeps up these nightmares, he may not wake up at all.&#34; <BR> <BR>Grendel returned tot the main screen as Roketh quit kicking to chamber glass. The Jills had indeed developed the means for travel by water, but preferred the air approach for now. His surveillance was half on the battle and half on Galin and the others. Galin held Moonshadow and Dadge flew behind them, in order not to burn them. They had taken off nearly an hour ago, but now were able to see the island. The Jills had took them to the coast using an underground tramway the called a subway. Those Jills, all that stuff and no one even knew about it. <BR> <BR>Galin shook his head; he had to keep focused. They could still see the two battling from a distance, and were glad to see that they still had time. Then, a giant cloud of purple seemed to explode off the top of the mountain. Galin knew that was a Joker attack, and they had to hurry. <BR> <BR>&#34;Drop me off on the edge of the island, I&#39;ll try and circle around and attack from behind. You two go strait from here and protect Blazemost.&#34; Moonshadow instructed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Nice plan,&#34; Galin complemented, &#34;But you&#39;re not in charge here.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Just do it.&#34; Moonshadow said sarcastically. <BR> <BR>Needless to say, Galin dropped him with enough speed to roll Moonshadow a good ways. The Tiger jumped to his feet and shook the dirt from his black coat before saying, &#34;Thank you!&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge flew ahead of Galin on the left, so Galin decided to go right. The Phoenix was down all right, and in a bad way. He had landed on a rock, and was lying there, almost embracing it. Blazemost looked down as the Joker walked over to him. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, after a good battle, I doth deem your death, fire bird.&#34; <BR> <BR>As he raised his scythe for the final blow, an extremely fast shot hit his scythe. He stumbled back as the bullet flew into the distance. <BR> <BR>Dadge landed between the injured Blazemost and the startled Joker as he said slowly, &#34;I&#39;m impressed. Usually my armor piercing shells go through metal. One heck of a weapon there.&#34; <BR> <BR>If the Joker weren&#39;t already smiling, he would have as he said, &#34;I really hate to cut short a conversation with a new acquaintances, but I have rather pressing matters at the moment. So I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t play with a pitiful human.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;How about a Dragon?&#34; <BR> <BR>As the Joker turned, he caught a pretty decent lick in the jaw. He spun, stumbled a ways, and grabbed his face with his free hand. Galin stood there, just staring back at the Joker. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, since you put it that way,&#34; The Joker said calmly, &#34;I am De&#39;spyre. Also known as your superior foolish Dragon!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Name&#39;s Galin, son of Kingston,&#34; Galin got into a comfortable fighting position before adding, &#34;And I think you going to get beat.&#34; <BR> <BR>De&#39;spyre attacked first swinging his scythe at the dragon&#39;s midsection. Galin jumped back slightly and, as the blade whipped around, grasp it with both his bottom hands. He pulled the scythe until the blade was behind him and gave a good yank. The Joker was instantly jerked towards Galin, who threw the weapon. As De&#39;spyre hit Galin, Galin locked all four arms around him like two, huge vice grips. The Joker&#39;s arms curled upwards, as if he was being squeezed to death. <BR> <BR>&#34;This is too easy.&#34; Galin remarked. <BR> <BR>&#34;Not at all,&#34; De&#39;spyre said slowly, &#34;Just sizing you up, and letting your confidence get the better of you.&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin glanced down at the ever smiling Joker, and tightened his grip just in case before adding, &#34;Get out of this then.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Gladly.&#34; Said the Joker. Galin felt two palms on his abs, and looked down. About the time he looked down, he saw the Joker&#39;s hands glowing purple. He threw the Joker into the air, knowing all to well of the Death Energy attack Joker&#39;s have. It did not help, as the Joker only spun in the air and rained the attack upon him from above. Dadge watched as a purple cloud surrounded Galin. He then noted that, somehow, De&#39;spyre had gotten his scythe back. The Joker began to lower himself into the purple haze when, out of seemingly nowhere, a black blur flew above the Joker from behind. It was moving to fast for Dadge to know what it was. However, that was answered quickly. Moonshadow landed into the back of De&#39;spyre with the force of a thousand Tigers, and both plummeted into the violet mist. <BR> <BR>Dadge heard fighting, and knew he had too much firepower to go in there, guns blazing. He decided to be more creative. He hit his jetpack up to 80% and began flying circles around the barrier that hid the three monsters from him. As he did, the haze began to circle upwards and revealed the clashing monsters in their entirety. Galin was standing more toe-to-toe with the opposing Joker, as Moonshadow blitzkrieged him from all sides. <BR> <BR>Finally, Galin put all his strength into his top right fist and threw it with all his rage at the Joker. The Joker ducked, spun sideways, and planted the blunt end of his weapon into Galin&#39;s unsuspecting abdomen. Galin had the wind knocked out of him as he went to his knees, all four arms clasped around his stomach, eyes squinting in pain. Moonshadow dove at him once more. He hit true, in the small of the Joker&#39;s back, and pushed off him to land back on his feet. He never made it that far. The Joker turned with frightening speed, holding out his open hand. Several boomerangs of pure energy shot out. Moonshadow did a good job dodging, but was not fast enough. The insides of the curved blades were sharp, while the outside edge was rather blunt, and they were all spinning. One blade grazed his right front paw. A minor cut, but then one came up under him, slicing him from the belly up. It was not deep enough to kill, but deep enough to hamper and offensive. The third hit Moonshadow between his eyes, blunt side first. Moonshadow landed on his feet, but was slightly offset and dazed. When he finally regained sight of the Joker, De&#39;spyre tossed his open hand at the Terror Dog, and a force of invisible energy slammed into Moonshadow. The Tiger type flew off the side of the mountain, and rolled all the way to the bottom. <BR> <BR>The Joker turned to face Galin. As he did, an explosion hit him square in the back. He flew forwards, towards Galin. Galin rolled onto his back, kicking De&#39;spyre over him. The Joker landed on his face, but was quick to recover. He turned and gave a piercing stare at Dadge. Dadge could see the smoke coming off his back, drifting over his head. Dadge knew he was seething inside, burning with rage. <BR> <BR>&#34;Foolish, insolent human! You have used us for far too long. Now, you will know that no human is even equal to that of a monster! Much less dominant!&#34; De&#39;spyre screamed. <BR> <BR>As he did, a red spiral flared up about him. The base being circular, twisting as it went up to form a cone. The thick streams of crimson pulsed off the ground and surged into the air. Dadge could feel the energy, and knew this was going to be a hard-fought battle. The Joker laughed within his column of raging energy. The energy began to dissipate, but De&#39;spyre had changed. Dadge could sense it more than see it. The sockets of the mask were embers, slightly glowing as they illuminated De&#39;spyre&#39;s cheeks. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now,&#34; De&#39;spyre spoke slowly as he moved towards Dadge, &#34;Now know pain, know the suffrage of the monsters you raise only to fight!&#34; <BR> <BR>The Joker did something Dadge had never seen a Joker do. As he spoke, he moved his lips. It was no longer a mere mask, but was an actual face, one that could smile, frown, and laugh with expression. The mouth opened and a stream of fire shot at Dadge. Dadge knew he could not dodge in time, and raised his arms in an X fashion. As he felt the heat of the fire, Dadge closed his eyes. The heat grew into insane proportions suddenly. Dadge&#39;s arms began to sweat, but no flame hit him. He slowly opened his eye, and saw nothing but flaming feathers in front of him. He took several steps back and stared in awe at the Phoenix there. The stream of fire almost fed the firebird, as it stood there, absorbing the attack. The Joker stopped, his face was first of surprise, then pure glee. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes! I knew you&#39;d be a worthy opponent! Now I get to play with you some more.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Phoenix spoke in an odd tone. It seemed that a slightly lower echo of the same voice followed his voice. Like a shadow of sound that resided within him, as he relied, &#34;You can&#39;t hope to win in the end. You may beat me, but the other Lords will fight on.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh, that&#39;s no concern of mine,&#34; De&#39;spyre spoke calmly, &#34;I&#39;m merely a mercenary this go around.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You…think he&#39;ll…pay you?&#34; A faint voice came from behind. They all looked to see Galin struggling to his feet, &#34;You payment will, more than just likely…. be….death.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Joker&#39;s new face twisted both cheeks upward as he chuckled slightly, &#34;Let just see that weakling try that. In the mean time, I do not turn on my employers.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Never doubt our master.&#34; A deep voice bellowed from above. As De&#39;spyre looked up, a massive Armored Dragon and a Phoenix landed on each side of him. He recognized them as Kronock&#39;s henchmen, Dracoul and Namerca. <BR> <BR>&#34;Not that I needed the help, but it is welcome.&#34; De&#39;spyre said, then added quickly, &#34;But this better not deduct from my pay!&#34; <BR> <BR>Dracoul turned to face Galin, who had managed to catch his breath and was ready for action, &#34;He is mine.&#34; The Armored Dragon spoke deeply and marched towards the opposing Dragon. <BR> <BR>Namerca looked at Dadge with content as she said, &#34;You were hired to slay that phoenix, we were just watching, but now we&#39;re evening the odds. The human is mine!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;So be it,&#34; The Joker snickered, &#34;That means your all mine, buzzard.&#34; As he spoke, he lifted his scythe towards the Phoenix. <BR> <BR>Blazemost took flight instantly. The average Joker merely hovers, nothing more. As you might have guessed, he wasn&#39;t average. He pursued, with a long cloud of purple gas forming behind him. As the two began to battle, the fire trail following Blazemost and the purple one following De&#39;spyre, everyone on the ground quickly lost sight of them. <BR> <BR>Dracoul walking casually towards Galin, who he easily dwarfed in comparison. Galin stood up strait yet was still only up to the Armored Dragon&#39;s shoulders. Dracoul obviously was not the speedy type, but if he got a hold of you it was all over. Dracoul took a deep breath and raised his left hand into the air. Galin ducked just in time as the crashing fist smashed the rock under the falling hand. Galin crouched and bounded at his head. Galin spun and kicked Dracoul in the mouth, then spun again and punched him between the eyes. Dracoul opened his mouth, attempting to bite the annoying Dragon in two. Galin grabbed his top jaw and flipped over his head, as Dracoul&#39;s teeth came down on nothing. Galin stood on the beast&#39;s shoulders. He held on with his bottom two hands, and wailed away with his top two. Then, Dracoul&#39;s tail, which had a mace like object, slammed into Galin&#39;s back. This sent Galin back over Dracoul&#39;s head. The Armored Dragon wasted no time on this opportunity. He clutched his fist together, axe-handle style and brought them down with force. Galin, who had not hit the ground yet, was instantly spiked into a crater of himself. He was belly down, and now propped himself up on his two right elbows. He caught a glimpse of something beside him. As he turned his head to his right, Dracoul planted a field-goal style kick into Galin&#39;s ribs. Galin flipped out of his hole and rolled nearly twenty feet. Galin slid a ways before he managed to stop himself. As was on all arms and both knees, just staring at the ground. He saw some sweat drip off his right arm, but noticed blood running down his left. He had a few cuts and bruises now, but at this rate… <BR> <BR>Dadge hit a panel on his arm. Out popped a laserblade, similar in design to that of a Hengers&#39; but modified to resemble the large sword of the Durahans&#39;. He now was attempting to slash Namerca, to no avail. Then, he raised the sword over his head, and brought it down with all his might. The Phoenix leapt back as the sword passed her and slammed into the ground. Dadge cut a hole resembling a line in the hard ground. As he looked up, he only saw two talons coming, and no time to react. Each talon sunk into his shoulders. He landed on his back, the firebird pinning him down. <BR> <BR>&#34;Today on cooking with Namerca,&#34; She grinned intently as she added, &#34;Human stir-fry.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge looked down at his chest plate. It began to bubble and melt. The metal began to bead up and trickle off his Clover, to form red, steaming puddles on the ground. He had to get out of this and fast. He instantly hit his jetpack, instantly flying out from under Namerca. He flew parallel to the ground. In a rage, Namerca took to the air, raining fireballs from her mouth. Dadge began to dodge left and right as explosions rang up from the now scorched earth. One fateful shot hit him in his left leg, sending him spiraling. He crashed into the ground as he turned his pack off. He was breathing hard, his armor damaged, his balance off, and he hadn&#39;t even touched the Phoenix. Namerca landed about six feet in front of him, laughing. <BR> <BR>&#34;If I would&#39;ve known you were this easy without your Jills I would&#39;ve stayed in bed.&#34; Namerca jested. <BR> <BR>Just then, Dadge&#39;s ammunition pack hit the ground. Dadge and Namerca both looked at it in an instant. Naturally, Namerca laughed again, &#34;Your falling apart!&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge hadn&#39;t noticed that his strap had nearly burnt off when she had him pinned down. He was lucky she wasn&#39;t on his back. I mean, if that heat would&#39;ve gotten to the bag… <BR> <BR>&#34;Wait a second…&#34; Dadge said, with his unmistakable grin, &#34;That&#39;s it!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What is? Your life?&#34; Namerca mocked on. <BR> <BR>Dadge reached down slowly and grabbed the bag with his left hand. He then turned his forearm sword back on; it was on his right arm. He charged at Namerca, pulling his right hand to his chest and swinging outward in a wide ark. Naturally, Namerca flew backwards. Dadge saw his chance and threw the satchel at her chest. It hit, but didn&#39;t explode. It was insulated, being close to Dadge&#39;s jetpack, he couldn&#39;t complain. The Phoenix grabbed the backpack with her talon and held it up to her face, examining it. <BR> <BR>&#34;What were you trying to do? Knock me off balance or knock me out? This thing is kinda heav-,&#34; Namerca was cut short by the massive explosion. Dadge was sent flying back as the shells flew in all direction exploding everywhere. <BR> <BR>&#34;What the?&#34; De&#39;spyre said as he looked down, Blazemost also stunned. <BR> <BR>Dracoul turned and saw nothing but Phoenix feathers landing around a large hole with a lot of black smoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;NO!&#34; He screamed as he ran towards Dadge. Galin took this opportunity with open arms. Literally. <BR> <BR>Galin dove at the mammoth&#39;s feet, latching two sets of arms around each foot. Dracoul toppled with the combined weight of himself with his current speed. The gigantic monster hit the earth with such a force that Dadge actually fell over. Galin jumped on the dazed monsters back as the dirt erupted from around the creature. <BR> <BR>&#34;Aura Balls!&#34; Galin screamed as he let loose one of his trademark moves. He was standing on his target. Dadge thought it would destroy them both. The shots went into the Armored Dragon&#39;s back, both of them screaming. After a very small number of these, Galin saw that they weren&#39;t going to do the job. He knew that this monster would kill them all if he didn&#39;t finish him now. <BR> <BR>Dadge watched in horror as Galin raised his hands over his head, to form to ever-frightening X. Dadge only managed to stammer out a light, &#34;No…&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin&#39;s hands were over his head, and Dracoul was still stunned by the event that had taken place. The blue orb appeared and pulsed in the Dragon&#39;s hands. The electricity fired off each of his hands, slowly moving up and down his palms and fingers. A light blue sphere appeared around them, small bits of lightning also coming from it to charge the attack. Galin had given that Ant Lion only a small charge, but this big boy was going to get the whole nine yards. Galin seemed to struggle with the energy as it grew. This was even more apparent when he attempted to point it down. It fought him the whole way, but eventually it was pointing down at the scared stiff opponent. <BR> <BR>&#34;You can&#39;t,&#34; Dracoul stammered, &#34;You&#39;ll die, too.&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin had several flashes of his conversation with Grendel. The ancient Jill was wise, and willing to die for all he held dear. Galin glanced off into the orange horizon as he spoke to himself. <BR> <BR>&#34;Never miss the sunsets.&#34; <BR> <BR>The explosion was huge. Dadge was sent flying off the edge of the cliff. He remembered looking up and seeing both De&#39;spyre and Blazemost be sent higher into the air. Dadge saw the edge of the mountain growing ever more distant, blue rings pulsed off it in a circular fashion. He hit his pack at the last possible second, and shot back up to the top of the plateau. When he landed, all that was left of the Armored Dragon was his cybernetic visor that was on his eyes. Dadge glanced down on the inside of it. A bright, &#39;Malfunction&#39;, paraded across the screen several times before fading into black. <BR> <BR>Dadge looked at the crater. That didn&#39;t surprise him as much as when he looked across the huge hole. He saw a blue dragon, four arms, lying on his back. He was breathing slowly and deeply. He hit his pack and sailed over the explosion area, noting pieces of Dragon scale, red and blue alike, along with some chunks of golden material. He landed beside Galin and lifted his head. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well…&#34;Galin spoke slowly, &#34;I got him.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Why? Why would you die before we face Kronock?&#34; Dadge asked as he checked him over for serious wounds. <BR> <BR>&#34;That&#39;s just it,&#34; Galin whispered, &#34;Grendel told me I&#39;d know the time if I had to sacrifice myself. As I looked at the sunset, I realized this wasn&#39;t it. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll know when, but I sure knew it wasn&#39;t now. Right now, little buddy, someone else needs your help.&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin raised a lazy arm and pointed behind Dadge before it fell back to the ground. He turned and saw Blazemost still fighting De&#39;spyre, but on the ground. <BR> <BR>Then, a golden light appeared beside Blazemost, from the edge of the cliff. Both monsters looked to see a golden Tiger bound over the edge and barrel towards De&#39;spyre with blinding speed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Go…now…&#34; Galin spoke once more, &#34;You&#39;ll stand a better chance if all three of you fight right now.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge nodded and ran towards the battling monsters. The Joker held his free hand towards the Tiger and fired several purple bolts at him. Moonshadow was unfazed as he continued to charge. De&#39;spyre raised his scythe in the air as he said, &#34;Have it your way. Steel it is!&#34; <BR> <BR>Moonshadow knew he couldn&#39;t dodge this attack, and braced himself. The scythe came down and struck. Moonshadow opened his eyes to see a blade of light blocking the ebony weapon. Dadge stood there, looking at De&#39;spyre through the corner of his right eye, over his shoulder. <BR> <BR>&#34;Impressive, for a human.&#34; De&#39;spyre said calmly. Then, he pulled his scythe blade back, throwing the blunt end up. This slapped up Dadge&#39;s arm. De&#39;spyre spun the scythe around in the air once and swung right for Dadge&#39;s head. A bolt of energy caught him in the chest, forcing him back. He stared down at the golden Terror Dog. Blazemost landed beside Moonshadow and said, &#34;Hit him with all you got.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Phoenix shot a stream of not just fire, liquid fire from its mouth. Moonshadow shot lightening and used his blizzard attack. The three elements seemed to curl and contort themselves into a long, thick spear-like projection. The Joker only laughed as he slashed once, and the attack flew into the distance. <BR> <BR>&#34;This one is gonna be tough.&#34; Dadge thought. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hmm,&#34; De&#39;spyre said slowly, &#34;I guess the assassination will be postponed for about ohh…&#34; <BR> <BR>He laughed hysterically as he added, &#34;about ten minutes.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>-The battle has gone into full swing. Two of Kronock&#39;s henchmen are out of the way, but one still remains. Possibly the most powerful one at Kronock&#39;s ranks save Kronock himself. Is there more powerful monsters than even De&#39;spyre? Can the others win with their two dragons now out of this fight? Roketh is recuperating and Galin has been severely injured. Will the assistance of Blazemost, Lord of Fire be enough to help them win this battle?- <BR> <BR> <BR>CHB Enjoy and Stay Tuned
