 Justin could not sleep a wink.  Chill was already snoozing away in the freezer, his favorite resting spot.  The rookie didn&#39;t know which path to take.  There were several interesting opportunities.  He could stay at the school and learn more advanced training methods, join a club or have Chill active in Monster/Trainer sports.  However, Justin was anxious to see the world.  In order to achieve the rank of Master Trainer, he had to travel to the city of Okala, where the Class Ranking tournaments were held.  Finally, he slumbered in the midst of his thoughts. <BR>    In the morning, he was awakened by what felt like a bucket of cold water being splashed on him.  In reality, it was Chill&#39;s way of waking him up with a cold embracing hug.  After Justin woke up and stretched, he scrambled some eggs for his monster and his own stomach.  Justin was an orphan, his parents disappeared sometime after the discovery of Monsters on Earth.  The school had provided him with a room on the campus for as long as he attended, but after breakfast, he packed up all of his belongings and headed to school plaza to join the other departing students.   <BR>      There was a great number of students leaving, including Brandon.  Laura wanted to stay and learn more, so she waved good-bye to her friends and wished them luck.  Tesca II was there to wish them luck as well. <BR>&#34;Rookie Trainers, the road to becoming a master is a long and challenging one.  There is no easy way out, it will take the strongest and smartest to reach the top rank.  May you all have the best of luck on your journey.&#34; <BR>Before they left, each student was given $5000 to start.  The best way to make money was to win local battles and tournaments around the world.  They were advised that the best route to Okala was through Farmwood Plains.  The place was famous for rookies on the start of their quest and the terrain was nice and smooth, at least, that&#39;s how they all thought it would be.
