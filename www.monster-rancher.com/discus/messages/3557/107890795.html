 We finally caught up with Kesha, who was hurriedly telling the other ranchers to evacuate. Soon we had a very large group of monsters and people, all running down a rather steep mountain. Comical, except for the fact that everybody was running for their lives. Much to our surprise, there were four separate sleds, each pulled by a massive baku, waiting for us at the bottom. We didn&#39;t ask questions, only hopped on the sleds. <BR> <BR> After we had safely got out of Brillia, we had ended up at the central shrine. It was then I decided to ask Kesha just what was going on. <BR> <BR>&#34;A huge crack appeared at the top of the mountain, and out climbed a huge furry dragon. I don&#39;t know what it really looked like, other than that. We were too scared.&#34; Her suzurin had clamped onto her leg and didn&#39;t seem to want to come off. &#34;Say, where did little Picott get to?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What? He&#39;s gone? AGAIN?&#34; I shifted around the crowds, who were busily panicing to each other, and found Picott, fighting with the same squrrel he had a few days ago. This time I decided to pick him up and take him away from the squrrel, not wanting to repeat the experience over. Suddenly, the shrine keeper stepped up to a podium and began to announce. <BR> <BR>&#34;People of Brillia! You may not go back to Brillia until further notice, for your own sagety! Meanwhile, any other region is availible to you for living and training!&#34; After this message, many people were moaning and grumbling and complaining, but I didn&#39;t mind, I didn&#39;t have anything up there anyway. A bit of food, and Picott had his beloved pillow, so we decided to just leave right there and travel to the only place I really remembered besides Brillia: Kalaragi. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>I didn&#39;t write that much today, but I&#39;ll write a longer one tomorrow to make up for it. Anybody else want to submit your characters? I so far have one character to use:P Oh, and comments are always appreciated, do I really need to keep saying it? lol!

 Yay! I&#39;m getting comments, and volunteers! I was wondering, should I start putting in your characters for the next chapter or waiting a bit? And yea, my two favourite training areas too! It&#39;s why I chose them:p

 Oh yes, and I wanted to mention, I won&#39;t be doing any more chapters until at least friday, because last friday I missed my bus and nobody was home to drive me, so my punishment is to go to bed at 9:30... grr... Usually my  best writing time is at 10:00 or 10:30, so this poses quite a problem:p

 Not really a Pancho fan, but you have my attention. <BR> <BR>Make chapters longer, only correction.

 Ok, out of work, and have time to elaborate. <BR> <BR>I read the first chapter of this story, and liked it, except the Pancho. Not a big fan. <BR> <BR>Apparently, I missed when the other chapters were posted, for some circumstance or another. After catching up, I am very impressed. I even enjoy the characterization you give a &#42;gasp&#42; PANCHO! <BR> <BR>Either way, I patiently wait.

 Magnus Hieferson &#40;High-fer-son&#41; and I guess I would say Kato but I don&#39;t want him to loose. I&#39;ll say a Madillo, pure bred, named Hordebuster
