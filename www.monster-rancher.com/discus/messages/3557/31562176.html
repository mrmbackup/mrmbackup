For everyone wondering which came first, Pokemon or Monster Rancher, I thought I&#39;d post an attempt at a comprehensive history of this sort of game. Thanks to everyone linked here, for putting such great info out on the web!  <BR> <BR><CENTER>And, eternal gratitude to the programmers, developers, artists, writers, and game companies involved in the creation of each of these projects!</CENTER> <BR> <BR><B><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">1970:</FONT></B> <I><B>Life by John Conway</B></I> <BR>That&#39;s right! People were playing computer games back then, and had been for almost a decade! Mr. Conway was a mathematician at Cambridge and developed this extremely addictive game which gained worldwide attention through Martin Garder&#39;s articles about it Scientific American magazine. Life puzzles became standard parts of mathematics curricula across the US, and a popular hobby for those with access to computers. I recall working on it for hours back in 1975. <BR>A decent interpretation apears in the Game Boy Color cart &#34;Microsoft, The Best Of Entertainment Pack, 7 Ways To Play&#34;. The game is titled &#34;Life Genesis&#34;, UPC 6-82433-01003-2 <BR><A HREF="http://www.math.com/students/wonders/life/life.html" TARGET="_blank">What is the Game of Life?</A> A good place to learn more! <BR><A HREF="http://home.mieweb.com/jason/life/" TARGET="_blank">Jason&#39;s Life Page</A> Strategy for Life. <BR> <BR><B><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">1981:</FONT></B> <I><B>Crush, Crumble And Chomp</B></I> <BR>Epyx/Automated Simulations releases the first game which uses a random number generator to create monsters. Players supplied answers to questions which then determined characteristics. Originally released for TRS-80, AppleII and Atari, it was released a year later for Commodore 64. <BR><FONT SIZE="-2"><B>Note: I tried to find a fun link about this game and simply could not.

This game was a huge success in Japan for about 2 years, where they also released a cartridge for the Super Famicom that linked to the reader and allowed you to battle in full color on your TV. <BR><A HREF="http://atarihq.com/tsr/odd/fc/barcode.html" TARGET="_blank">Barcode World</A> <BR> <BR><B><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">1994:</FONT></B><I><B>Mercurious Pretty</B></I>  <BR>NEC releases a virtual life raising sim, featuring a variety of Pixies and Sprites. If anyone wonders why Tecmo doesn&#39;t make a &#34;Pixie Rancher&#34; game, this is why. It would be re-released on PC in 1998, and on Dreamcast 11/16/2000. It is VERY text and spoken Japanese-heavy, with German as the secondary &#40;4%&#41; language. <BR><A HREF="http://www.shinforce.com/dreamcast/previews/MercuriusPretty.htm" TARGET="_blank">ShinForce Preview</A> -short commentary with screenshots. <BR> <BR><B><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">1995:</FONT></B> <I><B>Tamagatchi</B></I> <BR>This Bandai handheld took Japan by storm in late December of 1995, and by the time it hit the US in April of 1996, the excitement was overwhelming! People collected the colors, looked for rares, and most of all played these little guys EVERYWHERE. Automobile accidents, school disruptions, lack of sleep all ensued. <BR><A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~Tamagotchi_Central/" TARGET="_blank">Tamagatchi Central</A> <BR> <BR><B><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">1996:</FONT></B> <I><B>Tamagatchi Digimon</B></I> <BR>Bandai introduced special tamagatchi that could &#34;dock &amp; rock&#34;, in spring. You raised a monster then battled it with other monsters by connecting the handhelds. It had a brief period of popularity, but faded as the virtual pet fad came to an end. <BR> <BR><I><B>Pokemon</B></I> <BR>Februray saw the quiet Japanese release of a couple of Game Boy games, simply called &#34;Red&#34; and &#34;Green&#34;. The games sold slowly until Nintendo released a cartoon series based on the game, about 9 months later. By summer of 1998, US observers were shaking their heads at Japan&#39;s &#34;Poke-mania&#34; and placed modest orders with Nintendo for the upcoming US release. <BR> <BR><B><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">1997:</FONT></B> <I><B>Monster Farm</B></I> <BR>May of 1997 saw the Japanese introduced to a highly addictive game for PSX.

Red &amp; Blue are released, in the US, September 1. No one pays much attention for a few months, and sales are sluggish until December. The rest is pretty well documented history. <BR> <BR><I><B>Dragon Warrior Monsters</B></I> <BR>Enix, Japan, adds a new twist on their RPG series by adding a monster raising feature to their RPG.

New console games follow the ineveitable flood of merchandise.

 i love the 70s and 80s precursers, lisa.  let me get this striaght, tho - monster farm was released in japan 6 months before any form of pokemon?  this is not a trick question - obviously, there have been a lot of threads, and a lot of chat discussion, about this point, and i was never clear on it.

Yes, in the US. I know that my MR dates are absolutely correct. And, I have the US release dates for the first Pokemon games directly off the Ninetendo website. <BR> <BR>I have an <B>October 1998</B> &#40;one year after Monster Rancher&#39;s release&#41; issue of Next Generation Magazine with a sidebar on page 19 showing a Pokemon store in Japan: <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>&#34;Pocket Monsters continue to invade the Japanese consciousness and the high street. Ninetendo released the first of its three Pocket Monsters N64 titles, Pokemon Stadium, simultaneously with the opening of a dedicated Pokemon store in Tokyo and the release of an anime movie titled Pocket Monster Myushi&#39;s Counter-Attack. <BR> <BR>   The release date for the game was carefully timed to keep Japanese children from skipping school to claim their digital devils, and the store was standing room only from the minute it opened, containing such sought-after items as the rare Pikachu edition of Game Boy Light &#40;adorned with the tiny yellow monster&#41;. It&#39;s only a matter of time before Nintendo&#39;s hyper-successful franchise makes its way to U.S. shores -- first on Game Boy and then on N64.&#34;</I></FONT> <BR> <BR>Pokemon was released in February 1996 in Japan, Monster Farm was released in July 1997. However, both were in development during the same time frame -it takes 3-6 years to produce a game.

 I remember Tamagotchis! Then they had to make Angels because all the little kids were getting upset that their pets were dying! LOL. They should make a hand held Mocchi. Or Pixie! Bad idea...

 I&#39;ve mentioned it before, but in this little historical treatise I thought I would put my 2 cents worth in again. Mail Order Monsters was one of my favorite games on the C-64, and the main reason I saw the potential in MR and bought it. I never played Crush, Crumble and Chomp, but I did play the Movie Monster Game. Not quite as good as MOM, but a lot better graphics.  <BR> <BR>Coincidentally, the Hordlings from MOM are spherical monsters with a single big eye. They have two legs, but no arms... &#42;G&#42;

 A game I think merits consideration, and I&#39;m sure  <BR>Thorr will second me, is Master of Monsters for  <BR>the Sega Genesis. Players chose M, who summoned  <BR>monsters in towers and sent them out to battle  <BR>and conquer other towers. The monsters gained  <BR>experience and grew into more powerful forms. It  <BR>was more a wargame than a Sim, but since I have  <BR>fond memories of playing head to head for 12&#43;  <BR>HOURS &#40;hey Thorr- it&#39;a segmented worm! and how  <BR>the heck are we gonna get 36 Spangler nuts?!&#41;
