 I was sneaking. Trying to locate the Dragon. And then, it hit me!  A sword, it hit me with power! And then there was... <BR> <BR>Nothing. A void of nothing. And then, a memory! A piece of one.. <BR> <BR>A horrid, dark figure loomed over me. All it was saying was.. &#40;Ragedom... Dragon...Ragedom! Dragon!&#41; <BR> <BR>Then--voices. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now you&#39;ve done it! I swear, you&#39;re worse than those idiotic Golems!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It looked fiendish to me! I just knew it was an enemy!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;As far as I&#39;m concerned you hurt an innocent monster. At least you should have called Master Newfang about it!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Master Newfang this, Master Newfang that! Do you ever act on your own?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Not in these situations! Ragedom doesn&#39;t belong to either of us! If someone is trespassing, it&#39;s Master Newfang who makes the decision on what to do!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, I just know he&#39;s going to thank me for taking care of this stray SkullMew. I just knew it was coming to steal something!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s horrible that you judge a monster before you even meet them!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s horrible that you&#39;re so off guard!&#34; <BR> <BR>Heavy footsteps. Someone new was approaching. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now now, what&#39;s the problem you two?&#34; <BR> <BR>I was shocked. That was human language! But the shape my blurry eyes made out was clearly monster... <BR> <BR>&#34;A stray monster came to the ranch and Dur whacked it with his sword. Now it&#39;s unconcious and probably hurt.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Dur?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I was protecting the Ranch! Everyone knows that Ragedom is rich! A skilled thief is bound to want to try their hand here!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;But as Lan was saying, it&#39;s no reason to attack without understanding.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank you, Master Newfang.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;But as Dur was saying, Lan--you have to have your guard up as well. Some monsters aren&#39;t going to stop and chat with you about why they&#39;re here. You need to use discrimation. Between who you feel is safe, and who you feel isn&#39;t. You cannot trust everyone.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Now move aside, let me see this monster...&#34; <BR> <BR>The voices ceased. Instead, I blurrily and dimly saw a large, green eye, staring at me..  <BR> <BR>And it was quite an eye. Or rather, it seemed, until I opened my eyes. So close to me, I realized that the eye... had writing on it? Ancient writing... I knew this writing! But from where? <BR> <BR>I reached forward! <BR> <BR>The dragon jumped back. Regaining my sight completely, I stared up, up, up at him.  <BR> <BR>He was absolutely huge. I was amazed! And yet, there was nothing brutish about him. He seemed very old to me, older then a Dragon should be... He was calm, and quite collected, and seemed very fair in his actions. I hoped he would have mercy on me for trespassing, especially since I didn&#39;t know why I was here.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Whoa there, young monster! Trying to poke my eye out are we?&#34;, said the Dragon, grinning and laughing. <BR> <BR>I looked around. <BR> <BR>&#34;Where am I?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You&#39;re in Ragedom, one of the finest monster ranches around. Now answer me a question. Who are you?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m...Devata.&#34;, I said, surprised that I remembered my name. <BR> <BR>&#34;Would you like to tell me why you are here, Devata?&#34; <BR> <BR>I froze.. Why WAS I were? I didn&#39;t.. know. At least not anymore. <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; <BR> <BR>The dragon looked at me strangly. What was he thinking? <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, Devata..&#34;, he began, voice full of stability, almost nobility, as if he were an old and wise king making a difficult decision, &#34;If you wish, you may stay with us here at Ragedom. My job is to take in the lost, and none seems more lost than you, my child!&#34; <BR> <BR>I was slightly relieved. I had found myself a home, it seemed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank you.&#34;, I said, still puzzled. How in the world did I get here? <BR> <BR>&#40;Ragedom... Dragon...Ragedom! Dragon!&#41; <BR> <BR>What was this? And why did it plague me? <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, come on, Mew!&#34;, cried the Durahan, glaring at me with ditrust. <BR> <BR>The Durahan. He looked scathingly at me, as if I was some scamp of a stray! I was not! I knew I had a purpose, a reason for being here... but what was it? <BR> <BR>And then, a calmer voice. A kinder voice. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ignore Dur, Devata. He&#39;s an idiot who can&#39;t handle others.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s you I can&#39;t handle, Lan!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Whatever, Dur. Look, Devata, you&#39;re welcome here.&#34; <BR> <BR>I looked up at the kind Antlan. He had soft eyes and I could tell he was no brach warrior. Soft as they were, however, his eyes were sharp with a kind of intelligence that I knew was rare. Mind you, not wisdom, like the Dragon, but pure obtained intelligence. I knew that the Book in the corner of the Ranch was his and his alone.  <BR> <BR>The Durahan seemed to be just the opposite of the Antlan--full of arrogance and brute strength. His eyes glared deeply into you, intimidatingly--as if he were trying to size up everything and everyone for a fight. And a fight he had taken to me indeed! It would take some time for me to gain his trust, if ever.  <BR> <BR>But I was glad that I was welcomed by the Antlan, and walked side by side with the three monsters as they headed back to the House. Obviously training had ended for the day.  <BR> <BR>I sighed.  <BR> <BR>Would I ever learn why I was here?  <BR> <BR>&#40;Ragedom... Dragon... Ragedom! Dragon!&#41; <BR> <BR>I just didn&#39;t know... <BR> <BR>End Chapter Two

 I still have no sense of plot, but the lenght is improved, and the descriptions are as good as ever.

 Well, I only have one thing to say... wait and see what the plot is! <BR> <BR>The story is supposed to be Devata&#39;s point of view, and since she seems rather confused about everything at the moment, how can this story relate to you directly what&#39;s going on? All in time will be revealed, just as it is revealed to Devata.  <BR> <BR>And thanks for saying I have good descriptions! ^_^
