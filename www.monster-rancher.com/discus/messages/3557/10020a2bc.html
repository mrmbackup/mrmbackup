<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:Daeore@hotmail.com>Daeore Dermegil</A></B> on <B>Thursday, April 10, 2003 - 03:54 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 &#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Despite the delay, the next morning, after awaking in Angel&#39;s arms, my eyes feeling red and puffy, I felt worlds better.  My muscles were a little sore, but it was &#39;the good ache&#39;, one you get from a job well done. <BR> <BR>About midday, after our little party got up, washed, dressed, and did various morning things, we received a knock at the door.  Making my way across the sparsely furnished cabin, kindly provided for us from the villagers, I answered the door to find Geoff, a big grin on his weathered face. <BR> <BR>&#34;Good morning!&#34;  He said in a slightly too loud voice, &#34;Glad too see you are awake.&#34;  He entered when I stepped aside, then sat down after waving to Sarah and Angel, who were working on breakfast, porridge by the smell of it, and then Durahan, who was hopping up and down on first one leg, then the other, with a comical array of metallic noises.  Durahan paused his exercise to give Geoff a thumb&#39;s up. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well!&#34;  Geoff started after he had turned in his seat, propping an elbow up on the dinner table.  &#34;The rest of the hunters and myself have gotten together some of what we could spare, and taken the liberty to fill up your travel supplies.  I&#39;d bet you were sick of mangos by now eh?&#34; <BR> <BR>We all nodded.  Save Angel, who had taken a liking to the sweet fruit.  &#34;We could pay...&#34;  I started. <BR> <BR>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t hear of it!  You did a huge favor for this village.  I mean, if you hadn&#39;t come a month later, I don&#39;t think you would have found much more than an empty ring of cabins here...&#34;  We all shared a somber moment, for we knew it was true. <BR> <BR>I nodded, and shrugged.  &#34;Well, who are we to complain.  We thank you for your hospitality, food and drink.&#34;  I repeated the thank you line my father taught me. <BR> <BR>So with that, we left.  The village, all those who could walk, were there to see us off.  Our packs heavy again with food, our bodies clothed with thicker clothes, and our spirits high again, we set out after a look to Angel, who once again pointed north. <BR> <BR>It was mostly uneventful, our journey.  We found more opportunity to hunt as we moved away from the territory of the Dean.  As the miles passed beneath our feet, the weeks passing slowly, but steadily, the weather got colder.  The late fall became winter quickly, as we proceeded into the colder part of the continent.  For the first time, I saw snow.  Real snow, not the freezing slush we might have gotten back home once or twice a year.  Sarah had about the same reaction I did at first. <BR> <BR>&#34;I wish something this pretty wasn&#39;t so cold.&#34;  She said one night in the large tent we all shared after she had taken down the curtain that allowed privacy between us.  &#34;Is it much further Angel?&#34; <BR> <BR>Angel gave one of her now, all to common sighs.  She closed her eyes, and motioned a &#39;so-so&#39; with her hand.  Sarah sighed.  &#34;Its been almost a month since we left that village...  But we aren&#39;t there yet?&#34; <BR> <BR>Angel sighed again, but patted Sarah on the shoulder.  Durahan was as much a trooper then as he has always been, but he and I exchanged worried looks all the same.  We were all getting weary of this trek.  I&#39;ll even admit, that I wasn&#39;t so sure I could see it through.  But all it took was seeing Angel sad.  I had never seen her that way when I was growing up.  And it was a sight I hated more than my father&#39;s betrayer.  It made me want to find out just what was so...  Horrible, that it would make Angel so sad. <BR> <BR>Again the weeks plodded along, our feet sore, our food almost reduced to just what we could catch.  We had no trouble finding water, the snow melted easily enough into clean water.  Firewood was a little bit of a chore...  But Durahan and his great sword made wood available if we could find no dead branches, heaven knew there was no shortage of pine needles, if you felt like digging in the snow a little.  But finally, as we were starting to lose all hope, our clothes almost not enough to ward off the cold, we came upon the oddest thing. <BR> <BR>It was almost like an oasis.  We came across a stone marker, with odd spidery letters on it.  Angel, when asked to translate, wrote the word &#39;magic&#39; on her notepad.  After about a mile, what she meant became clear. <BR> <BR>Slowly, the snow thinned out, the ground started to show more and more green, the trees started to become mixed with a more leafy assortment.  It was almost like we walked an entire season change in the span of a mile.  Angel seemed pleased with herself as well. <BR> <BR>&#34;We are almost there, aren&#39;t we?&#34;  Sarah asked, noticing Angel&#39;s mood brightening up. <BR> <BR>With a pleased nod nod of her head, Angel took her notepad and wrote &#39;Almost.  I remember the way.&#39;  The word &#39;remember&#39; was adorned with little stars and a couple underlines.  Yes, Angel&#39;s mood had changed.  But I knew it was because this is where I wanted to be here, not her. <BR> <BR>Angel too the lead, and soon we were in a comfortable, almost summer, climate.  We had to pack up out winter clothes, it got so warm.  With this, we decided to make a bit of a camp, Sarah and I both wanted to explode this wondrous place. <BR> <BR>It was so...  Alive.  Birds sang, small forest animals chattered, the trees bore fruit that Sarah and I had never seen before.  We even saw a small pack of monkeys, playing around in the tall treetops, not a care in the world.  Sarah and I had only seen a monkey once, when a traveling circus came to town. <BR> <BR>Angel and Durahan stayed at the camp, but did a little of their own exploring.  Durahan made a friend with a very colourful bird who took an interest in his great sword as a perch, while Angel...  Well, when Sarah and I returned to the camp, a half dozen energetic monkeys were paying attention to her as if she was telling a story, as she kneeled among them.  They all scattered when we approached her, but stayed just outside of the clearing we had set up as camp, to dry our winter clothes and boots.  The bird on Durahan&#39;s sword regarded us with a wide range of observant head motions, while Durahan himself shrugged, letting the bird adorn his sword. <BR> <BR>&#34;WOW!&#34;  I exclaimed, &#34;This place is amazing.  Who&#39;d have thought such a place would exist in the middle of that frozen landscape.  Is this really where you are from, Angel?&#34; <BR> <BR>Just as she started to nod her head, something started to feel wrong.  We all felt it, almost like a wave of danger.  The monkeys at the edge of the clearing panicked with loud squawking and howling noises, the bird on Durahan&#39;s sword cawed once, and leapt into the air with great haste.  Sarah and I also felt a sudden urge to be anywhere but here.  Angel too, looked startled, and Durahan gripped his sword in a ready stance. <BR> <BR>Then we felt it.  The ground was rumbling quietly.  Just a slight tremor at first, then harder, faster, and suddenly the ground of the clearing exploded.  Dirt and grass flying everywhere, Huge &#39;some things&#39; erupting out of the ground with it. <BR> <BR>&#34;WORM!&#34;  Sarah shouted, I saw it too.  Six of them.  Angel reacted the fastest of us all, and grabbed her bag.  Then with a volume I&#39;d never heard before, she waved us all in her direction with a loud squeak, and ran. <BR> <BR>Not knowing what else to do, I grabbed Sarah&#39;s arm, and tugged her with me, Durahan taking a swing at the nearest Worm, and followed behind us.  It seemed as if the Worm were disoriented by the bright light and the shriek of pain from Durahan&#39;s target, but within a couple of moments, they were after us, crashing through the narrow forest paths with a furious pace. <BR> <BR>Very soon, it seemed as if they would catch us, but then we came to another clearing, Angel leading the way.  This one, however, was a huge clearing.  Mostly overgrown with some vines and shrubs, but what looked like large blocks of stone walkway seemed to prevent more than that from growing here.  In the middle of the clearing was a shrine.  Huge compared to any shrine I&#39;d seen, it still had the same architecture.  Spires at the four corners of the raised rectangle foundation.  High domed ceilings, and once wondrous carvings and statues on the walls and along the path leading to the front door, that was sealed by a huge stone door. <BR> <BR>We ran on, the Worms crashing behind us, towards the shrine.  Durahan, guarding the rear, deliberately slowed down occasionally to deal a shard blow to the nose of the lead Worm, who would, in turn, fall back with a shriek of pain, while Durahan ran faster again with a steady clank of metal boots on stone.  Finally we got to the front steps.  Angel had slowed a little to match my pace, and handed me the odd disk fragment.  I took it, the sharp edges of the stone cutting into my hand slightly, and looked at her.  As we stopped at the door, I saw what the fragment was for before Angel answered with an out of breath finger pointing. <BR> <BR>The stone door, huge and obviously immovable, had what looked like a sacred disk carved where a lock would normally be placed.  The disk was missing a segment, and looking down at the fragment in my hand, I knew where the segment had gone.  Hastily, I jammed the odd &#39;key&#39; in to the hole, and got immediate results.  Not fast enough, as Durahan had to actually for an instant stop, to execute a spinning slash, cutting a Worm neatly in two along it&#39;s length.  He danced about, swinging his sword and buying us time to open the door.  Sarah, Angel and I turned back to the door to see the now complete disk, turn twice clockwise, and then split up the middle with a thin flash of green light.  Two long bars seemed to melt out of the stone itself, before the door seemed to finish unlocking.  Angel squeaked again, throwing herself at a handle, and pulling as hard as she could.  We both helped her, as Sarah cried desperately for Durahan to come help. <BR> <BR>He was occupied.  I swore as a vision of what was going to happen flooded through my mind.  Durahan turned with a hollow sounding bellow, and ignored us.  He looked once towards us, and grimly kept fighting, backing up towards the door as the three of us pulled.  He continued to fight, outnumbered four to one, as the door gave by inches to our concerted pulling. <BR> <BR>Then, as we started to file into the door, calling again for Durahan, another Worm erupted out of the ground, and made for the door.  Durahan turned and pursued it, giving the closest of the Worms a cursory swing to give him a little ground.  I felt hope rise in my chest as he made for the door, just before leaping backwards as the Worm wedged itself into the door trying to force it open, to get to us.  With an all too human sounding yell, Durahan reached the worm and swung.  The huge horned head falling inwards, landing wetly at my feet.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Durahan!  Come on!&#34;  I shouted.  But my only reply was something heavy slamming into my chest, then the door crashing shut, with something else clattering to the floor. <BR> <BR>I looked at the object at the door first.  About two feet long, it was a Worm tusk.  Sharp and made out of what some monster ranchers called the hardest bone of any monster in existence.  I heard Sarah gasp, then turn and cry into Angel&#39;s shoulder, as my gaze trailed from the bone to the object on my chest. <BR> <BR>It was Durahan&#39;s left arm, or rather, the armor that used to cover it.  The red banner still attached to the shoulder segment, the four parts slid off my chest and onto the floor, as I felt my blood freeze in my veins. <BR> <BR> <BR>====================== <BR> <BR>Again, I do apologize for the delay.  BUT, here it is! <BR> <BR>A fitting #13 chapter, if you ask me. <BR> <BR>Comments are always welcome, good and bad.

 Thank you thank you.  ^_^  maybe when it is all done, I&#39;ll post the entire thing in the epics forum, instead of in parts here in the short story forum.

 Finally got to catch up on the whole thing. I understand what it is to be caught up in the affairs life can hand all to well. Delays are inevitable. <BR> <BR>On a better note, I&#39;m impressed with your writing ability. I remember when we first started the new site, we didn&#39;t have too many writers, and not many newer faces. I think this one is a really good story, its not like my &#39;die-hard action sequences&#39;, which is actually refreshing for me. <BR> <BR>All in all, great plot and charactor set up, excellent on the suspense and mystery of &#39;the secret&#39;, and a charactor set up that would make any novelist envious. Keep up the great work.

 I feel praised.  o.o  Thank you CHB. <BR> <BR>Believe it or not, I&#39;m not satisfied with my writing ability.  Some times I feel like scrapping a chapter and writing the thing over again, but then I&#39;d get frustrated and give up for the day.  So, I press onwards. <BR> <BR>As for the action sequences...  I&#39;ve toned my standard sequence down ALOT...  Back in the day when I was doing sailor moon fanfics, I did almost to the motion combat.  Long winded, but I was praised by the more imaginative of my fans. <BR> <BR>That is niether here nor there.  So stay tuned for my next chapter... when I get the time to write it.  =^_^=

 if you haven&#39;t already, daeore, read chb&#39;s epic.  some chapters are almost wall to wall action, yet they are imaginatively done enough so it does not get tedious. <BR> <BR>in general, i prefer the tempo of your current story - more spaces, more characterization.  but, as always, there is more than one way to skin the story cat.

 Well, that one I started what, 3 years ago? :P <BR> <BR>Yeah, the story starts off kinda slow and not well written, but it develops into something that actually could hold a candle to the classic Rise of the Master saga.
