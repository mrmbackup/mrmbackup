 Good morning everyone, today&#39;s tablets are purple!&#34;  The babies cheered, and the rest lined up in front of Jadzia, eagerly awaiting today&#39;s food.  In the back of the line stood Churchill, a young Skipper who had just recently been transferred to Beta Team, which took part in both Pull and Leap drills for their training.  Jadzia just stood smiling, looking care-free as she passed out the small, violet tablets among all of the monsters.  Finally, Churchill got his turn to eat, and he quickly grabbed the tablet from the young trainer assistant.  She smiled at him cutely, then turned to everyone else.  &#34;Ok, after breakfast, proceed to your respective training areas.  Bon appetite!&#34;  She then left. <BR>   Churchill eyed his tablet with curiosity.  True, he had been eating them all his life, but he still had no idea what they were.  He turned to Nimo, a 10 year old Mock who was well respected as the eldest monster of them all.  &#34;Nimo, what are tablets made of?&#34; Churchill asked. <BR>&#34;Well little one, tablets are made right here on Klastra ranch, they are packed with nutrients and vitamins which will make you strong.  They are one of the many reasons I&#39;ve lived this lo-,&#34; Nimo hacked loudly &#34;Sorry about that, anyway, they are the reason I&#39;ve lived this long and the reason why every monster on this ranch becomes a champion.&#34;  Churchill nodded, he still had questions as to the strange taste but he understood that he wouldn&#39;t know what pure nutrients tasted like anyway. <BR>     Soon, meal time was over, and Churchill started off towards the pull training area.  It was far behind the huge ranch, so the walk itself was apparently making them stronger as well.  On the way, they passed the windmill like always.  Churchill never figured out what went on in that windmill, but he supposed from the horrible grind of machinery that would go off late at night that it was where the tablets were produced.  Churchill shrugged off his questions and began the day&#39;s training.   <BR>     His companions in Beta team were a healthy mix of mocchis, suezos, assorted others and Nimo.  Nimo had been struggling lately, not being able to pull the huge pile of rocks up the hill like everybody else.  Normally, the drill commander, Wilheim, would just sigh and look away.  But today, something different happened.  Wilheim told us all that Nimo was going to go into &#34;special training&#34;, and to that we were all relieved to hear.  They all went home without Nimo, assuming all was going well. <BR>    Later that night, when they were all put to rest, Churchill looked out the window.  He saw something moving towards the windmill.  It was Wilheim, and he had somebody with him, that largely resembled the outline of a walking tree. <BR> <BR>To Be Continued.....
