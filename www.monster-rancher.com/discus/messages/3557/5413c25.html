 Chapter 3:Shadows of the past  <BR>&#34;Cold, so cold....&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Deep in the ladoran slavemines a young Daina sat huddled in a dark corner alongside her mother. They were imprisioned in a large steel walled cell with several other monsters of various types and subbreeds. There living conditions could be described as horrendous, the walls caked with thick grime, the floor filthy and ladened with dust, and as always it was cold, terribly cold. The little ones mother lay next to her, bruised, pained and exhausted from yesterdays labor. It was the same for every monster traped in those icy walls. They payed little attention to each other for the most part, sticking close only for warmth, each trying to ignore their anguish long enough to get some rest. Little sunlight entered this place of nightmares, the one spot where a few rays of sun hit had been taken over by a large Baku. No other monster could contest his postion, none had the strength.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Mommy, I&#39;m cold.&#34;The little daina asked. Her mother stirred slightly but did not awaken, still too tired from her labors. The little one was about to ask again but thought better of it, knowing well that this was her mothers only chance to rest. Instead the young daina curled into a tight ball and tired to sleep herself. Just as she was dozing something nugged her. Looking up she saw it was the baku.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Are you cold?&#34;He asked and she nodded yes. Then the baku lay his head flat to the ground and told her to get on. After a moments hesitation the daina climbed atop the his head and he shifted position so that the suns rays fell upon her. Sitting there, on the baku&#39;s furry head and enjoying the suns warmth was a moment of pure bliss that hadn&#39;t been experienced for many long years in that place by any monster. Some how the sun reminded her of something she&#39;d long forgotten, something she&#39;d not felt since infancy. The vague distant memory of freedom.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Whats your name?&#34;She asked the baku, stroking his fur gently.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Gobgo,&#34;He replied&#34;Yours?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Shielka,&#34;She said.  <BR>	 <BR>Suddenly the sound of footsteps could be heard approaching the cell and every monster began to awaken as if by impluse. Armed humans opened the foot thick metal door. All the monsters hated them, but the one they hated and feared the most stepped forward. The slave master glared at them in angry disgust as if they&#39;d done somthing wrong.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Get up ya worthless beasts!&#34;He screamed at them&#34;Theres still plenty of discs to be gathered down in the mine. Get over there and get to work!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>The monsters, heads hung low, lined up and filed out one by miserable one. Sure the humans were armed but it wasn&#39;t that which drained the monsters will to fight back against them. After many long, painful years their spirits had been broken, ground into dust and thrown out into the wind. By now many believed that freedom was a lie, merely something they once dreamed. Before leaving the adult Daina turned to her dauther and the baku.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Could you look after her until I finish?&#34;She asked the Baku.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Yes, my shift isn&#39;t until tonight anyway.&#34;He responded.  <BR>	 <BR>Several hours later Shielka waited for her mother to return. It had been only eight hours since the work began which meant it would be anouther hour before she returned. Then, the loud clomping of two pairs of footsteps echoed through the corridors. The door opened and the daina was tossed in like a rag doll. She was hurt badly, clearly brutalized and lay limp on the stone floor. Her duather cried and shook her but she didn&#39;t respond. Finally she opened her eyes.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I-I droped...a disk,&#34;She said weakly before passing out again.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Hey! We need help in here!&#34;Yelled Gobgo&#34;She&#39;s hurt real bad.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Help, her!&#34;Shielka screamed as well.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;So what?&#34;The guard screamed back&#34;That disc she broke was worth alot more then her life! Now shut in there!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;How dare you!&#34;For a moment Gobgo&#39;s rage was beyond the point where he could hold it in and shy away. He charged the door with all his might, shaking the entire prision, the door alas, did not budge.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Hahaha, bet you won&#39;t do that again.&#34;The guard laughed&#34;Stupid freaks of nature think they can- &#34;All guards to the front gate!&#34;Someone screamed&#34;Where under attack! It&#39;s moo! Moo&#39;s forces are here!&#34; The guarded stoped laughing and ran off to join his comrades. Seconds later the sounds of battle exploded around them. Men screaming in pain and horror could be clearly heard, as well as flesh tearing and bones cracking. It didn&#39;t last very long and in fifteen minutes all was quiet. A hare appeared, one that they&#39;ed been imprisoned with and unlocked the door. Using the same key he unlocked the adult daina&#39;s wing clamps that made flight impossible.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;We&#39;re free! Moo has saved us!&#34;He said raising his paws in victory.&#34; Come, a messenger of Moo is speaking to the others.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Outside they found most of the human slavers laying dead and mutilated on the ground. A pure Naga bearing the crest of moo addressed the former prisoners. He talked about the glory of Moo&#39;s conquest of humanity. About a world ruled only by monsters. He went on saying that monsters were the rightful rulers of this world and under the reign of moo it would become a paradise. All this sounded great to shielka but Gobgo looked at the naga with a fair amount of distrust. After winning over all the prisioners who were eager to join moo shielka approached.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;We need help!&#34;She called to the naga&#34;Please help my mom.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>The Naga took one glance at daina&#39;s battered form and scoffed and hissed.&#34;Moo has no time for the weak, only the stronge may join him! Allowing humans to do such a thing, you are a disgrace to your breed.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;No, you are a disgrace to yours.&#34;Daina said, struggling to stand.&#34;Don&#39;t you see Naga? Your a slave yourself.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;What!? You dare insult me??&#34;Naga raged&#34;Do you know who I am?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Yes, your one of his generals.&#34;Daina said forcing herself to stand straight and proud, reflecting her dragon lineage.&#34;Just a pretty word for pawn, servent...slave. But the difference between you and me? You choose to be a slave.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Naga would be insulted no longer and ordered his troops to attack. A small army of slightly smaller naga&#39;s appeared and were attemping to surround them. The huge Baku stepped forward, thrusting his bulk inbetween the naga&#39;s and the two daina&#39;s.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Get the girl out of here!&#34;He cried.  <BR>	 <BR>Daina nodded &#34;Thank you,&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Thank me by saving the little one,&#34;Gobgo said as he faced the naga&#39;s and turned his fury toward moo&#39;s forces. Meanwhile the two daina&#39;s fled, trying to escape through the twisting halls of the prision. Shielka followed her mother who seemed to know where she was going. Finally they came to a back door used in case of emergencies. Suddenly it swung open, four naga&#39;s barred the way but it didn&#39;t matter. Daina scooped up her child and charged passed them, knocking two the monsters back. Once outside she ran and took flight, something she hadn&#39;t done in many years. The Nagas attacked from afar with deadly energy shots, all were avoided and they soon lost sight of their prey. <BR>	 <BR>The daina flew for what seemed like an eternity before coming to a place where molten rock flowed from the earth. Active volcano&#39;s errupted constantly in the distance, filling deep chasms with lava. It was extremely hot, perfect for a daina. At last, her energy spent, Shielka&#39;s mother landed near one of the dormant volcano&#39;s on the edge of the wasteland and collasped.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Mommy! We&#39;re free!&#34;Shielka hugged her mother tightly.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Yes.......Free.....&#34;Those were her mothers final words. Exhausted beyond the point of rest, she closed her eyes and failed to open them again. Shielka, believing that her mother was merely sleeping waited, and waited. After three long days she began to dispair.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Shielka....&#34;Said a strange voice.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Who&#39;s there!?&#34;the daina asked.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Come to me...&#34;The voice sounded like it was coming from the nearby volcano. Before her eyes a section of the volcano shifted and revealed a huge metal door.&#34;This way....&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;But, I have to wait for mom...&#34;She protested.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;She is dead child.&#34;The voice said coldly.  <BR>	&#34;No....&#34;Her eyes welled with tears&#34;No, no no!!!&#34; The voice allowed her to cry for several minutes. When it became clear that she wasn&#39;t stopping anytime soon it made it&#39;s presence known again.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t you want to get them back?&#34;It said&#34;Make them pay?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Make them &#40;sniff&#41; pay?&#34;Shielka said unsurly.&#34;Humans....Moo.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Yes, come to me and you can avenge your mother...&#34;The voice said.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Avenge? What does that mean?&#34;She wondered.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Make them feel your pain,&#34;said the voice&#34;Make them suffer as you have suffered. Make them pay for your loss....&#34;The young daina nodded affirmitivly.&#34;Then come child...and serve your Master.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Shielka awoke suddenly in a cold sweat, startled out of her restless slumber. She was laying in bed, within her room of the volcanic lair of the Master. Wiping a few salty tears from her face she realized she&#39;d cried in her sleep again. The now adult daina got out of bed wondering why she was being tortured with the same dream nearly every evening. Shielka wanted so desperatly to forget the pain of her childhood, why was she being forced to relive it night after night? Ten minutes later a voice called to her from outside.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;We&#39;ve got our next mission,&#34;Said the voice of the salamander, Zarzaas&#34;Open up!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Boneweary, she opened the door, the huge salamander entered carrying a map in his long talons and trying his hardest not to tear it. He proudly wore the symbol of the eye on his forehead. His was slightly different, being lined with silver showing that Zarzaas was high in the Masters favor.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;The master has located the equipment we need.&#34;He said&#34;We are to secure the tech and kill anything that interfers be it Moo&#39;s troops or anyone else. This is an important one, failure is not an option. Get ready and lets go.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Shielka picked up her own crest off the nearby table. It was lined with gold showing her position as the masters favorite of all. For this was the same place where she discovered him years ago. Where she swore loyalty to him....Though he raised her from a child the Master had always remain to distant to be thought of as a father or even a friend. The Master was simply the Master.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Zarzaas...are we slaves?&#34;She blurted out and the salamander gave her a strange look as to say &#39;What the hell are you talkin about??&#39;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Are you nuts? Of course not,&#34;He laughed&#34;We all have our own reasons for doing this, but only the master can make it all happen and crush those who oppress our kind. Be they the humans or moo or anyone else who just happens to piss us off! Driven by this goal we are invincible!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I guess your right...&#34;Shielka said still unsure&#34;Lets go then...&#34;  <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter 4:IMA Interference  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;That was close...&#34;Said the exhausted fairy hare, looking back at the ruined town of golran. The townspeople had finally given up the chase, even the more stubbern of them. Tired from the battle against Moo and the retreat from Golran the three monsters stopped to rest beneth a solitary tree on the roadside. It was late, around midnight, the heavy darkness illuminated slightly by the light of countless stars.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;By the way,&#34;Justice said sticking his blade into the soft earth and turning to the hare&#34;What is your name little one.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Beatdown.&#34;She said. Stone claw burst out laughing, rolling back and forth along the grass as he did so.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Hahahahaha! beatdown?? You&#39;ve got to be kidding me!&#34;Claw said through his insane laughter.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;You don&#39;t have to laugh yourself into a coma over it,&#34;She said crossing her arms.&#34;It&#39;s not a bad name. My master was just alittle...strange.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Strange? More like drunk!&#34;Claw continued to roll with laughter, his stone body flatening the grass.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Thats quite enough,&#34;Justice said to claw before turning back to the fairy hare.&#34;How did you get here?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;My trainer passed away awhile back,&#34;Beatdown said solomly&#34;I&#39;ve been wandering alone ever since...&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I know that feeling all too well...&#34;Justice said, the sight of his masters dead body flashed in his mind.&#34;Did you happen to see a Lorica and an aqua cutter on your way here?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Yeah, they were so rude!&#34;She said&#34;Pushing me down on the road. They were going to Windoa city. Next time I see them I&#39;ll smackem good!&#34;The hare then started to box an imaginary opponent.&#34;This is what I&#39;m gonna do to them!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;This chicks lost it!&#34;Stone claw said to Justice,&#34;We don&#39;t need any head cases hangin around us.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Wait! Can I come with you??&#34;Beatdown said&#34;I&#39;ve got nowhere to go anyway and it&#39;ll be nice to have company. Please!!!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Alright, you can come.&#34;Justice said&#34;We&#39;d better get some sleep, a long road awaits us.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>The next morning they awoke just before sunrise and continued the journey north. It was yet anouther bright day, strangly contrasting the events that had been occuring in the area as of late. The coming of moo&#39;s forces to this land, the murderous thieves, what was going on? Walking along the main road once again the trio headed for Windoa. Justice could see the faint outlines of the city far off, his prey had a sizeable head start and it would be difficult to overtake them. Justice did not care, he would have his revenge or die trying.  <BR>	 <BR>Later that afternoon the city of Windoa could a last be seen clearly in the distance. Justice knew it well, for this was the location of his last official match. He knew now that match would not be his last battle, far from it. The arena could be seen even from where they stood, towering over all else as the cities primier attraction. He noticed Stone claw stareing at it intently. The Trident moved in a daze, recalling his years of glory in the tournaments. Justice sighed, knowing well how the trident felt. Suddenly Claw stopped and became alert again.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;What is it?&#34;Justice asked and Claw motioned silently to his right. At first, the durahan saw only open fields. Patches of fur trees in some places, the snowcapped mountains on the far horizen. Then he spotted them, Detonairs. A pack of about twenty five lay hidden, their green coats and scales blending perfectly with the surrounding grass. They remain low to the ground and crept along like lions hunting a heard of zebra. Then the formost of them howled and the entire pack lept up and raced toward the city.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Moo again??&#34;Beatdown said.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;There&#39;s no time to talk!&#34;Justice said as he took off in pursuit.&#34;Stop them! Beatdown, your the fastest, run up ahead of us.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Why do you always stick you metal nose where it doesn&#39;t belong,&#34; Claw said sliding after them. &#34;We have a mission of our own, this is none of our business.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Moo is everyones business!&#34;The durahan said taking his sword and hurling it through the air. It came down right into the back of the last detonair, slicing it&#39;s spinal cord and slaying it. Claw summoned his dark power and sent energy shots flying. In all, four more detonairs fell but the remainder payed no heed to the lost comrades and we&#39;re quickly approaching the city. Beatdown had caught up with the pack however. She ran along side one and nailed it with a quick jab. Stunned by the blow, the deton fell behind allowing claw to finish it off. Finally one of the deton&#39;s stopped and attacked the fairy hare, pinning her to the ground. Beatdown slipped out from under him, jumped on his back and bashed the deton&#39;s skull in.  <BR>	 <BR>Seven had fallen but the rest of the detonairs charged straight into the city, tearing down a few people on the way. Justice and the others followed as quickly as possible. Entering the city at last the sounds of a battle could be heard from the square. Passing by a shrine and the marketplace the sounds became louder. But who was fighting the forces of moo? Making there way to the square the question was soon answered.  <BR>	 <BR>Several monsters had already engaged the detons. A legion of plated arrowheads were laying them to waste. Fighting along side them were golems, katos and a single pure durahan who seemed to be the commander. Within minutes the battle was over, the bodies of moo troops littered the streets like unwanted playthings. They never stood a chance. At last Justice realized who this durahan was.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Loveless,&#34;Justice said and the two clasped their steel hands together in a show of brotherhood.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Your justice aren&#39;t you?&#34;Loveless spoke&#34;I was sorry to hear of your retirement, I looked forward to facing you....and if it isn&#39;t Stone claw. What happened? You get paroled or something?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Claw sneered at his old rival as a middle aged man bearing the sign of the IMA commitee approached. First he congradulated Loveless and told him and the others to scout the surrounding area to make sure none of moo&#39;s monsters escaped. Then he turned and address Justice.&#34;Can I help you?&#34;He asked.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Just wondering whats going on,&#34;Justice asked.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Thats a fair question,&#34;He said&#34;Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Ivan and I represent the commitee.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;The IMA???&#34;Beatdown gasped&#34;What are you doing here??&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I was getting to that,&#34;Ivan said slightly annoyed by the interruption&#34;As you well know my organization had thus far turned a blind eye to the workings of moo. However with the recent outbreak of attacks it is clear that we can no longer remain in the shadows. Furthermore mysterious evil forces other then moo are coming out of the woodwork. Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know, but the IMA will stand idle no longer. We have access to the strongest monsters in the world as well as many of the very best trainers. Surely we can regain control. At the moment though I&#39;m currently recruiting renegade monsters to aid us in the war effort. Will you join us?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I am sorry,&#34;Justice said&#34;But I have something important to accomplish first. Perhaps anouther time....have you seen any monsters wearing a strange crest. The symbol of an eye.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Yes I have,&#34;Ivan said&#34;They bore right through here and killed several of my monsters. The two went north towards the forest. Very powerful those two, take care if you run into them. By the way, come back if you decide to join us.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Justice nodded and thanked him. Before long they exited the city through the northern gateway. A tremendous forest could be seen in the distance going on for many, many miles. If the thieves did flee into the forest, how in the world would they find them.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;We have to find them in that?&#34;Beatdown complained.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Stop whining,&#34;Justice said.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Why don&#39;t we just eat her?&#34;Claw licked his lips and laughed&#34;Take it from one with personal experence, hare tastes great!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Leave her alone claw,&#34;Justice said, pointing his sword in the direction of the emerald forest.&#34;I don&#39;t care where they go, where they hide. It won&#39;t change whats going to happen to them when I find them...and I will find them.&#34;
