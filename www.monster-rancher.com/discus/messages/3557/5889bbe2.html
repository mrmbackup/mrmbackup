 &#34;Go!&#34; <BR> <BR>The Henger began to sprint around the track, kicking up dust.  The running exercise was designed to build up stamina so it could last longer.  The upcoming events would test the true effectiveness of 0446&#39;s training--if it was failure, or succession.   <BR> <BR>Click.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Hm... 6.1 seconds.  That&#39;s an improvement of .1 over last month; keep it up and you&#39;ll be performing excellently.&#34; <BR> <BR>It lined up with the starting post and went at it again.   <BR> <BR>Ambition was a powerful characteristic, in the hands of good or evil.  Some of the greatest threats to the continent had stemmed from great personal ambition; some of the greatest contributors possessed sincere ambition for the good of others.   <BR> <BR>0446 had strong personal ambition.  It wanted to be the strongest.  It wanted to be what Jorus wanted it to be; no less.  Soon, 0446 would carry out the final points to Jorus&#39;s plans and reveal to him the true nature of the false moon.  But if that assistant, Asmen Ran&#39;Shadda, asked him to divulge his plans, he would have to tell her.  And if she tried to stop him... he&#39;d have to be gentle to avoid a falling-out with FIMBA.   <BR> <BR>He couldn&#39;t break his plans; not now, not ever.  He&#39;d been waiting too long to wait one more year.  Or another. <BR> <BR>The ancient text enscribed on that lodestone, the one that rested beneath the false moon, intrigued him.  Puzzled him.  Perplexed him.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Be one carried below the blood moon, that one be bloody.&#34; <BR> <BR>Or, at least that&#39;s what it translated to.  Nagaese had been a dead language since monsters had been &#34;sealed&#34; away.  Humans thought to rid themselves of the dead tongues of monsters; useless languages.  Even Golems and Mocchi had had their own languages; they, too, had been wiped out with the locking away.   <BR> <BR>But Jorus still remembered.  He had been there. <BR> <BR>He had seen their &#34;god&#34; swallow up every monster that had been and had seen the Disc Stones rain across the world.  He knew where they had landed.  He knew there were even some at the bottom of the sea, if you dug deep enough.  The sand itself could very well be the tiniest pieces of discs.  He knew that many discs had fallen into the ocean.   <BR> <BR>There had been a great flood.   <BR> <BR>And every language of every monster had been erased with it.  Most traces, anyways.  Things like the lodestone still remained.   <BR> <BR>Jorus, too.   <BR> <BR>Click. <BR> <BR>&#34;Working hard, I see.  6.1 again; perhaps you should rest.  I don&#39;t want you overworking yourself.&#34; <BR> <BR>The hiss of what Jorus had read as being &#34;hydraulics&#34; indicated 0446&#39;s willingness to have another go.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, if you insist.  But I won&#39;t time you anymore; I trust you&#39;ll finish of your own accord.  But make sure to call me in case you feel ill; you took a nasty blow to the head at the... grave.  We didn&#39;t think there would be any adverse effects, but...&#34; <BR> <BR>--SSSssss-- <BR> <BR>&#34;Okay, okay.  I&#39;ll be up at the ranch square if you need me.  That assisstant... Asmen, I think, will be here anytime now.  And I -don&#39;t- intend to miss her arrival.  Adieu...&#34; <BR> <BR>Stepping off the podium and watching the Henger&#39;s legs pumping furiously, he watched, smiling, as the Henger began to take a long-winded lapping run.  Depending on the monster, it could take from minutes to hours to finish.  0446 could very well be in the hours range, but Jorus never stood around to find out.   <BR> <BR>Walking through the surrounding forest, he gazed at the clear, blue sky, and listened to the surrounding sounds.  Tittering birds, the brush of wind on leaves, and the misplaced footfall.   <BR> <BR>Curse the footfall.   <BR> <BR>Stepping out of the brush, a figure wearing a cowl--hiding its face--spoke in a disguised voice, to match the disguised speaker.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you Jorus Konath?&#34; <BR> <BR>Cocking his head to one side, he responded, &#34;And what may you need?&#34; <BR> <BR>The shadow replied, &#34;Well you certainly match the description.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;My dear woman, I can assure you that I not only look the part, I play it well, too.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You&#39;re mighty cocky, Jorus.  But are you worthy of FIMBA&#39;s highest rankers?&#34; <BR> <BR>Pointing a finger at him, the accused woman yelled, &#34;Get him, Togara!&#34; <BR> <BR>A Golem came barreling out of the trees like a mountain ape.  Fists crushing the ground beneath, it knuckled its way towards Jorus.   <BR> <BR>Jorus placed his right foot forward and threw a fist towards the sky, yelling, &#34;Hector!  Come to me!&#34; <BR> <BR>As the woman bellowed laughter, Jorus saw brown curls and green eyes under the robe.  &#34;Hector!  What a name!  What is it supposed to do?  Nibble me to death?&#34; <BR> <BR>A thunderous cry erupted from the air.  Trees began to shake violently as fierce winds tore at them.  Leaves scattered everywhere as a shadow darkened the sky.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Wha...?&#34;  The woman stammered as she was forced back, away from the Golem.  The Golem had paused as the heavens grew dark and began to back up as well when it saw the cause of the sudden ecclipse.   <BR> <BR>Two, huge scaled feet hit the ground and made the paved road buckle under the weight of the leathery bulk the legs supported.  Huge, clawed hands extended from a muscled torso, balanced by a long, sinewy tail.  Giant wings blotted out the sun and a long neck, topped by a regal serpentine head, completed what was called by Jorus as &#34;Hector.&#34;   <BR> <BR>The FIMBA knew this monster well.  He only suspected that this woman knew it well, too.   <BR> <BR>They knew it as a Dragon.   <BR> <BR>Stroking his chin, Jorus spoke.  &#34;Dispose of the Golem, but do not kill it.  I do not want a black streak between me and the FIMBA organization.  Leave the poor lady alone; she&#39;s probably never seen a Dragon before.  At least, on a ranch.&#34; <BR> <BR>Shrieking again towards the woman and her golem, the force of the wind blew back the hood and wrapped the robe around the decidedly feminine figure of what Jorus now suspected to be Asmen Ran&#39;Shadda.  The Dragon then extended a foreclaw and gripped Togara by its chest, and began to flap into the sky.  The Golem hacked at the arm and fingers with its powerful limbs, but to no avail.  Triumphantly, Hector tossed the Golem up into the air and brought both fists down in an axehandle grip, spiking the Golem into the ground between Jorus and the woman.  Dust flew up and the shock of the impact nearly knocked Jorus to the ground.   <BR> <BR>As the Dragon settled back down, Togara was in the ground several feet above its bulk, lying on its back.  It was moving, but Jorus suspected that it was intelligent enough to not provoke Hector again.  Holding up his hand, the back of it to his Dragon, Jorus again spoke.   <BR> <BR>&#34;You may return to your tasks, Hector.  No doubt you find this entertaining, but I believe that you have made your point.  My, what big teeth you have.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Dragon took off again, to the sky.  Opening his arms, Jorus said to the speechless woman, &#34;What were you expecting?  A Hare, perhaps?  Or maybe a Tiger; I can&#39;t be sure.  After all, you must know nothing about me if you didn&#39;t know I had a Dragon.&#34; <BR> <BR>She slowly crept down the crater towards her Togara, her Golem.  &#34;He&#39;ll be all right,&#34; Jorus called.  &#34;Asmen Ran&#39;Shadda, I presume?&#34;   <BR> <BR>Turning very slowly to meet his gaze, she replied, &#34;The very same... but who, may I ask, are you?  You don&#39;t look half the age I would expect to accquire that kind of power!&#34; <BR> <BR>Jorus shrugged, and said, &#34;My name is Jorus Konath.  But, before you ask me of my life story, I must tell you it is very long.  May I ask if you and your Golem, Togara, would like to indulge in a peach?&#34;
