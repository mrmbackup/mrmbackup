 I&#39;ll apologize ahead of time. This one, is unbelievably long. So you might want to have some time on your hands before you begin reading ;P <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Well...?&#34; The hooded man asked his captain. who rode opposite of him in their carriage. <BR> <BR>&#34;My Lord, the one wielding the pike is our newest recruit, the one with the sword is a veteran, and the one with the axes....&#34; He didn&#39;t say anything for a brief moment, collecting his thoughts, then sputtered out with a sigh, &#34;...he is one of our best...&#34; <BR> <BR>The Baron chuckled slightly, made apparent by the bouncing of his massive shoulders, &#34;Well, looks like we could use these recruits...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sir, they&#39;re mercenaries, rabble, filth, and have no place in your Doom March.&#34; The captain said defensively. <BR> <BR>&#34;Even so, fool, they bested some of YOUR best. Who is at fault in this situation?&#34; <BR> <BR>The captain stuttered a bit, leaning back slightly. Before he could say a comprehensible word, a massive foot slammed into his throat, catching him off guard and pinning him to the back of the carriage. Baron Perenolde sat motionless, arms crossed, the only thing that had moved was his right leg, extended fully, into his incompetent cohort&#39;s neck. The captain grabbed it desperately, but was no match for the mighty Baron. <BR> <BR>&#34;Failure...you know the rest...&#34; <BR>  <BR> <BR>Meanwhile... <BR> <BR>Clymain sat on the wagon with two of the guards, and was behind the carriage that the Baron was in. Kale was in the lead carriage. Clymain was taking note of the scenery. The trees ran up almost infinitely, converging upward into twisting vines and branches, eventually melding into one giant canopy. The organic ceiling had no sign of light coming through, none at all. Clymain thought he kept seeing darting shadows out of the corners of his eyes, but every time he looked, nothing was there. Maybe paranoia, but it just didn&#39;t seem right. <BR> <BR>His thoughts were scattered when the carriage in front of him jerked, hard. Clymain put one hand on his Gorebaton, and watched intently. Then, the carriage shifted again, but this time, a massive, horizontal foot print appeared in the back of the carriage. Clymain was a bit disturbed, but even more so when the door opened slowly, and a limp person fell to the road with a sickening thud. As they rolled on, the guards seemed to act like nothing happened. Clymain blink incoherently at it all, and stared at the captain&#39;s body as they slowly rode by. His neck was completely flat, like a flap of skin connected his head to his torso, and a thin one at that. He was laying on his stomach, but it sickened Clymain to still be able to look him in the eyes. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, looks like I&#39;m next in line for captain...&#34; One of the guards stated, sounding very grim at the thought of his newest promotion opportunity. <BR>  <BR> <BR>Meanwhile... <BR> <BR>Kale leaned back, utterly alone inside his carriage. There was one driver, with a crossbow man beside him, and two on top of the carriage. Several other troops surrounded his carriage, armed out. He was the decoy, and loved it. He extended his arms across the back of the seat and leaned back slightly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, even if we don&#39;t get any action, at least we get to travel in style and get paid for it.&#34; He said to himself softly, leaning his head back and closing his eyes. <BR> <BR>Then, there was a load crash. The carriage jerked slightly, and the horses almost sounded as if they were screaming. Shouting erupted from every direction. Kale looked out the right window, only to see the blur of two guards being smashed by a flying horse. He glanced to his left to see several guards taking crossbow shots, and a few armed ones going forward. The carriage jerked again, this time enough to bounce Kale off his seat. All this transpired in a matter of seconds, and Kale grabbed his respective weapons, glancing around. Then, a huge dent appeared in the top of the carriage. Kale jerked slightly, staring up at it. He didn&#39;t know what is was, but blood began soaking into the roof, slowly oozing through the cracks. Kale dove out his right window, rolled up and found himself in a crouching position facing the carriage. He slowly rose, his jaw gaped, and his eyes shifted between the beast and the corpse of the driver that lay on the carriage roof. <BR> <BR>&#34;A Caustrodon...&#34; Kale stated half slurred as he watched it rip the intestines out of the other horse. <BR> <BR>Caustrodon are humanoid in form, except that they resemble cats to a similar liking. Roughly 10&#39; tall, this one stood well over the carriage height. Their arms are abnormally long, with razor sharp claws on each hand. Being somewhat intelligent, they also know how to wield simple tools, this one wielded a tree log. Their knees usually remain bent, in a crouching position, mainly to give them a quick boost of speed or a super long jump. They have no tail like most cats would, but like a feline, they have a mouth full of sharpened fangs to rip through the most durable steel. Very muscular, they rarely are phased by anything. This was obvious, as this Caustrodon was riddled with arrows already. A path was cut out behind it through the brush, obviously how it the jump on The Baron&#39;s caravan. It was probably not planned, they&#39;re not that smart. However, still a major problem. <BR> <BR>Kale took about two steps towards the beast, but he didn&#39;t get much further than that. The Caustrodon took its club in both hands, back-handing the carriage into a roll, right to Kale. Kale jumped into the air, bounced off a wheel, ran up the side of the rolling carriage, a small bound off the end, and landed solidly on his feet. Kale never took his eyes off the beast, even as the carriage slammed into a monstrous oak that towered behind him. <BR> <BR>The beast swung wildly at the guards, who for their parts weren&#39;t idiots. Kale was impressed that they were fighting it at all, let alone doing good. With a steady stream of arrows, others were darting in and out, some just running by it slashing. It wailed, swinging at them with a combination of log and claws. Then, out of nowhere, it slung a backward kick, nailing one of the guards square in the chest. The guard didn&#39;t even scream as he flew through the air, maybe in shock or he was already dead, Kale would never know. He watched the man slam into one of the trees at an angle, sending him into a spin off into the woods. <BR> <BR>Kale conquered his fear and decided it was time to attack. He ran strait at the beast, who managed to notice the blackish insect-like pest that charged him. The beast raised his log over his head with his left hand, swinging down with that one hand as hard as he could. Kale bounced to the side at the last second, and the tree slammed into the ground beside him. The force rolled Kale forward, but he fluently bounced over on his feet and charged past the beast&#39;s leg, angling his axe and scythe to where it cut a sizable triangle out of the Caustrodon&#39;s thigh. It wailed again, but came around swinging its log sideways, still only with its left hand. Kale jumped it, barely. The Caustrodon&#39;s momentum was thrown off by this, and grabbed the log with both hands to try and regain control of it. <BR> <BR>Kale slung his scythe at the beast&#39;s right hand with deadly accuracy. It whizzed through the air, finding a solid purchase in the creature&#39;s right wrist. It screamed again and threw its right hand strait into the air, slinging its tree into the canopy overhead. The chain ran out of slack quickly, and jerked Kale strait up and at the beast when it hit its end. Kale capitalized, flipping in mid air and planting a dual footed drop kick into the creature&#39;s throat. It backhanded Kale out of the air with his left hand. Kale landed hard, but rolled up into a crouching position, chain wrapped around his right hand, his left holding a firm grip on the axe. The beast was a tad stronger than he had estimated, and he&#39;d have to be careful. <BR> <BR>The Caustrodon rubbed its throat slightly with both hands coughing a bit, then its log slammed into the ground behind it. It ignored the sound entirely, focusing solely on its newest competition, who&#39;s scythe was still stuck in its wrist. The arrows were still flying, but the guards were giving Kale as much breathing room as possible. The Caustrodon ripped the scythe from his arm, and held the chain firmly with both hands. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh man...&#34; Managed to escape Kale&#39;s mouth as the beast jerked both hands over its head. <BR> <BR>Kale flew violently into the air, and as he got to the Caustrodon, it axe handled him into the ground. Kale, blinked slightly, the pain seemed to rampage through his body, but nothing felt broke. He gazed up a bit stunned, only to see the beast yank its hands to the right. Kale found himself flying only seconds later, this time, he found his footing against the tree he was almost slammed into, and planted his axe into the bark, suspending him there. Kale was standing sideways against the mighty oak, and it infuriated the Caustrodon. It slung the chain over its head again, attempting a similar move to his axe handle one, however, Kale was ready this time. The axe ripped from the wood in a shower of splinters and Kale flew towards the beast again. <BR> <BR>This time, he stayed very level headed. Kale was waiting for the right moment. The beast slung its hands over its head, preparing to axe handle him again, and Kale had found his opening. He slung his axe with all he could. The axe looked like a boomerang, with a wobbling slicing that tore through the air. It planted squarely in the thing&#39;s throat, lodging itself in a messy, crimson haze that seemed to shatter into the surrounding air. The Caustrodon&#39;s eyes grew huge and astonished. Not only this, but before it could do anything else, Kale&#39;s feet slammed into its shoulders, grabbing the axe with both hands. The beast stumbled a bit as it was struck, and stared up at the man straddling his chest in horror. With one swift jerk, Kale ripped the rest of the beast&#39;s throat out, and slipped off the blood. Kale landed flat on his back, starring up at a bloody beast, who stared down at a bloody man with the bloody axe. Kale&#39;s eyes widened as it outstretched its left hand into the air, preparing to make this battle the ultimate draw. <BR> <BR>A whirling, slicing sound was heard, then, Kale&#39;s skin quivered with the sound of parting flesh and snapping bone. The creature&#39;s arm exploded just past the elbow, sending a rain of blood upon Kale. He closed his eyes in this instant, but as he opened them, another sight awaited him. The creature was still alive, and with the exact same intent as before. This time, its right arm wavered into the air as the Caustrodon&#39;s strength faded. This time, a strait, non changing slicing sound cut the air. The Caustrodon&#39;s chest exploded, and huge amounts of gushing blood and assorted organs fell upon Kale. Kale could do nothing but cover his face. As he glanced up, the beast fell to its knees, and toppled over on him. <BR> <BR>&#34;Kale!&#34; Clymain screamed as he ran towards the fallen Caustrodon. <BR> <BR>Clymain watched as a red form emerged from the gaping hole in the creature&#39;s body, it held an axe and a chain, and seemed very disgruntled. <BR> <BR>&#34;You&#39;re alive!&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale said nothing for a moment, stepped out of the bloody body he was standing in, and walked over to Clymain slowly before adding, &#34;Took you long enough.&#34; <BR> <BR>Clymain chuckled and walked past the corpse, picking up his bloodied Gorebaton a few feet away. <BR> <BR>&#34;What happened anyway?&#34; Kale asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, &#34; Clymain spoke as he rubbed some blood off his Gorebaton, &#34;I slung my Gorebaton and severed its arm so it wouldn&#39;t kill you, but it almost did anyway, eh? Shouldn&#39;t get in fights without me there...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;How&#39;d you kill it?&#34; Kale asked as they headed past the smashed carriage. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, I did save you, but I didn&#39;t save you again...&#34; Clymain said as a guard rushed past them both, cradling a green, blood covered sword. <BR> <BR>Kale watched as he ran towards the Baron Perenolde, fell to his knees, and extended the hilt end towards the mammoth man. The Baron slowly grasped the handle, and slid it into its sheath on his back. The whole time, he never quit starring at Kale, and smiling. His gray hair blew calmly in the wind, and it was the first time Kale got to see his chiseled face. The Baron climbed back into his carriage, speaking to some of the guards. As he shut the door, the guards scattered. They began picking up bodies and loading them into the wagon, equipment and all. <BR> <BR>One of them ran up to the duo and said, &#34;Sirs, the Baron insists you ride in his carriage for the remainder of the trip.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale and Clymain looked at each other, and nodded. As they walked towards the carriage, Kale turned to take one final glance at his would be executioner. Several guards were lifting it and dragging it to the wagon. Kale didn&#39;t understand it, nor did he care to. Right now, he wanted paid, and then he wanted a good rest. <BR> <BR>Yet, he knew, they weren&#39;t out of Creador Forest by a long shot, and already exhausted as he was, he refused to even fathom the creations the forest had yet to unveil. <BR>  <BR> <BR>Later that evening.... <BR> <BR>&#34;I must say again, I&#39;m rather impressed by your lack of fear, young Kale. It takes considerably more than a handful of guts to attempt to overthrow a Caustrodon head on.&#34; The Baron made slight motions with his massive hands that were folded over his lap. All the two could see was the mighty chin, the sinister smile, and the majority of his nose. <BR> <BR>&#34;It was nothing.&#34; Kale sputtered, still trying to work the soreness out of his right arm by rotating it in small circles. He was nervous in the presence of the Baron Perenolde, after all, anyone who could be a crack shot with a two-handed sword should easily be considered deadly if anything else. Kale just couldn&#39;t take his eyes off that smile, that curious grin that was meant to be friendly but made the Baron all the more suspicious, like a demon smiling with a friendly gesture, it was impossible to believe. Plus, he was already uncomfortable being covered in dried blood. <BR> <BR>Clymain had sat there, occasionally engaging in the murky bits of the conversation, but for the most part he stared out the window wearily at the tree line. He felt a bit uneasy of not being able to assist Kale in the fight. Yet, in the time it took him to realize they were under attack, jump from the wagon, and throw his Gorebaton, the fight was already almost over. Still, if the Baron hadn&#39;t intervened, Kale would&#39;ve been dead easily. <BR> <BR>The road had been quiet since the Caustrodon incident, but the dangers that possibly lurked in the greenish forest shadows put seemingly everyone on ends for now, except the Baron. He kept a calm, collective cool, as if he was unconquerable, undefeatable, even invincible. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, it was obviously something, young buck, you almost had it. Our ranks could use talent of your caliber, both of yours.&#34; The Baron sounded almost sincere, until that venomous smile erupted on his face, which made Kale shutter. <BR> <BR>&#34;Perhaps, but I still like to travel the roads...&#34; Kale stammered out, in a broken, almost frightened tone. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, with all the political tension, you might find yourself choosing a side eventually. I just hope you recall this offer, as it will still stand.&#34; The Baron Perenolde said slightly motioning his left hand, palm up, over his carriage, as if offering him a seat in his elite. <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank you, Baron Perenolde, it is looked upon in great appreciation.&#34; Kale said with a nod, glancing over at Clymain, who continued to look out the window. <BR> <BR>&#34;It would be my honor.&#34; The vile smirk spoke. What was it about these lips that set Kale so foreign to security? The uncertainty and intimidation that walked up Kale&#39;s spine was enormous. Clymain must&#39;ve sensed this in his childhood friend, as he turned to look at him in this moment, his curious look stared into Kale&#39;s eyes. He said nothing, but after his brief conference with Kale&#39;s gaze, he returned his own toward the window. Kale also said nothing, he briefly looked towards the Baron, the grin was still there. Kale&#39;s head kept on its turn, slowly pulling toward the other window. <BR> <BR>Kale had millions of thoughts as it was, but before he could pick only one to dwell on, a shadow darted behind a tree. Kale blinked a few times, rubbed his eyes once, and stared out the window with a deathly serious stare. <BR> <BR>&#34;I think I saw something.&#34; Kale said slowly, still concentrating on the forest. <BR> <BR>&#34;Me too.&#34; Clymain said slowly in response, staring out the other side. <BR> <BR>The Baron said nothing. Kale looked toward him, as if to reiterate in case he didn&#39;t hear either of them. Before he said anything, he noticed the Baron licking his lips slowly, as if he was tasting something, or preparing to. Kale&#39;s blank stare at this was interrupted by Clymain&#39;s hand patting Kale&#39;s knee. <BR> <BR>&#34;Saw it again, get ready.&#34; Clymain said as he unsheathed his Gorebaton, holding it vertically between his legs. <BR> <BR>Kale grasped his scythe and axe, which were strapped on each side of his waist respectively. The chain was wrapped around each of them an equal length, which he began to unwind and wrap around his right wrist, as he customarily did, grabbing the chain in his right palm along side his axe, and allowed some slack between it and the scythe that resided in his left. Enough to get the maneuverability his fighting style demanded, and also to give his scythe a good throw if necessary. <BR> <BR>The duo eyed the trees intently, scanning each side of the remaining carriage with extreme aggression. The Baron sat motionless, not even grabbing his sword to prepare for battle. All the same, he seemed as if he was expecting it. <BR> <BR>Kale saw another shadow dart behind another tree, then he stated, &#34;They&#39;re leading us. Keeping tabs, these guys are just watching us, ensuring we walk into their trap.&#34; <BR> <BR>Clymain had to concur, as he had noticed this, too. As he turned to speak to Kale, he only saw his feet darting through the window. Clymain glanced up at the roof at the sound of footsteps. <BR> <BR>&#34;Your friend is a rather...&#34; The Baron paused, letting his smile emerge before adding, &#34;Anxious?&#34; <BR> <BR>Clymain said nothing, but opened his door and climbed onto the roof as well. Kale stood, ready for combat, eyeing the trees all around nervously. <BR> <BR>Clymain signaled to the guards to prepare for battle, and they did so accordingly. Loading bows, drawing swords, they&#39;d not be caught off guard again. <BR> <BR>&#34;They&#39;re everywhere, Clymain. I see them everywhere.&#34; Kale said slowly as he turned to face the forest beside the moving carriage. <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t understand why they are so deep in the forest. They must&#39;ve been forced out of the western edge of the forest if they are trying to intercept us this soon.&#34; Clymain said. <BR> <BR>Then, from under them, they heard a massive, booming voice say, &#34;It is my forces in the west they are frightened of. When they attack, kill them all...&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale recalled that the Baron&#39;s region was in the west, the dreaded Doom March army resided there as well. Though no one knew what this army comprised of, everyone feared it for its alleged size. <BR> <BR>Then, a crunching sound rang through the forest. Birds flew in horror, as Clymain and Kale both crouched into a combat stance, as did the rest of the caravan. Then, a massive tree crashed out of the forest and slammed into the path ahead. A great storm of dust and flying foliage came as a wave, engulfing the entire caravan. <BR> <BR>In the debris, Kale heard the whizzing of arrows and screamed, &#34;They&#39;re attacking, prepare yourselves!&#34; <BR> <BR>No sooner had he said this, an unknown form landed on the top of the carriage with Clymain and Kale. The human like shadow was crouched in a ninja stance, and before any of the three could react to another, a second shadowy figure swung in on a rope or vine of some type, kicking Clymain square in the chest. For all the weight his armor held, Clymain still found his feet in front of him, heading off the edge of the carriage. He landed hard, and the shadow flipped over his head, landing flat on its feet above Clymain&#39;s head. Clymain could only stare up at the shape in the flying dust, as it raised something resembling a sword over its head, preparing to impale Clymain. Then, a slicing sound cut out the rest of the noise of battle for only this instant, and a long, slender line slammed into the form, but he couldn&#39;t tell where the line had entered the figure over him. Clymain blink ignorantly as warm drops landed on his cheek, slowly running toward the ground. The line shot back out of the shape, which jerked forward, landing limply beside Clymain. Clymain stood, gripped his Gorebaton, and began to seek revenge on these unknown assailants. <BR> <BR>Kale&#39;s bloody scythe returned to his hand with amazing speed, and he turned from his friend&#39;s predicament to face the shadowy fiend on the carriage. It was still crouched like a ninja. Then, a slicing sound ripped Kale&#39;s ears, and the form began to squirm, screaming. Now he could tell it was a man, one in great pain. Then, he flew into the air, flying up and forward, disappearing into the dusty haze before Kale. Visibility was horrible, and Kale couldn&#39;t see where he landed, nor could he hear it over the sound of battle. He looked down to where the fiend had been. A bloody, dark green sword protruded up through the roof, and beside it was a massive fist that had punched through the top of the carriage. Kale looked on in awe as the fist and sword began ripping through the roof, and the Baron Perenolde emerged. <BR> <BR>&#34;Come Kale, let us wipe this filth from the world!&#34; The Baron exclaimed as he dove off the carriage into the fray. <BR> <BR>Kale didn&#39;t have time to follow, or even process the words as someone tackled him in the back. Kale was accustomed to rolling in this situation, and so attempted it. He was not, however, accustomed to there being a large hole in front of him. He and his unknown opponent tumbled head first into the carriage. <BR> <BR>Kale rolled with the shadow a bit, even the carriage was full of dust. Kale ended up sitting in one of the seats, the attacker was crouched in the floor. Kale didn&#39;t examine anymore of the scenery as the form raised the arm closest to Kale into the air, and its other arm shot under it, equipped with a blade, aiming for Kale&#39;s skull. <BR> <BR>Kale immediately jerked his head to the right, and the blade&#39;s point struck the wood, but didn&#39;t have enough force to penetrate it. The blade retracted and was almost instantly coming at him again. Kale jerked his head to the left this time, and the blade added another notch to the board behind him. This time, the blade didn&#39;t pull back, instead it began a sideways swipe, towards Kale&#39;s titled head. Kale threw his waist out a bit and pulled his head down and, instead of decapitating him, the blade carved a line across the wood that ran over his head. As he pulled his head up, the blade was coming yet again for a stab. This time, Kale had his bearings more than when he had first fallen through the gap. <BR> <BR>He shot his hands up, the chain between them pinned the sword to the roof. Kale planted his foot into his foes stomach. A female voice rang in the coughing sound his foe made. This threw Kale off just enough to let his foe counter again. She pulled the blade strait down, and sparks flew from the chain as it tried to cut it. The chain held true, but the sword was coming down now, right at Kale&#39;s head. Kale reacted quickly, as he spun a complete circle and managed to pin the sword to the seat, in the same manner he had to the roof, with his chain. He was now standing, hunkered down in the carriage right beside his would be killer. Their heads briefly faced each other in stupidity, though they couldn&#39;t see each others faces. Kale bumped her to one door, and he himself threw his back against the other. <BR> <BR>At this point she attempted to stab him again. Kale had gripped each edge of the window, so he couldn&#39;t use his weapons. Thus, he kicked his left foot up and pinned the sword against the roof with his sole. In the very next motion, he slammed his right foot into his opponent&#39;s stomach again. He managed to hit with enough force to knock the door behind her off the hinges, and she tumbled out the door landing on her back. Kale didn&#39;t have any time to react, as the door he was leaning on was knocked off the hinges as well. <BR> <BR>Clymain took another swing at his two opponents. One dodged this horizontal slice with a back flip, the other merely pulled his abdomen out of harms way, bowing his entire body to dodge the attack. Clymain swung again and again, not intending on letting them begin attacking him. They were very nimble bandits. He swung constantly, and they worked their battle to the side of the carriage. Then, he saw one pulling something from behind its back. Clymain realized quickly what it was as the arm raised up and quickly toward Clymain. <BR> <BR>The Gorebaton rose to the cause and slapped the dagger into the woods with the sound of clashing metal. He lowered his weapon, staring at the two opponent&#39;s, who gripped their swords eagerly. The one closest to the carriage was crouched like some black robed assassin, and the other stood with a lazy fighting stance, some four feet away from his partner. Then, the carriage door came off the hinges, with a form on it. The door landed on the crouching shadow, and the second jumped away unsure of this unorthodoxed surprise attack. The figure on the door rolled backward and rolled up in a crouched position, and Clymain noted the chain that danced close to the ground. The second warrior attempted to attack Kale, but before he could follow up his strike, Clymain was there. <BR> <BR>Kale came up staggering, and a shadow was falling on him. Then, another shadow darted in and the attacking shadow jerked hard into the air. It didn&#39;t come back down, but sat there, suspended in the air above the other form. Then, a ripping sound was heard as the body fell to its knees. Kale watched the shape slowly empty its shadowy guts unto the dirt path, then collapsed over them, almost trying to protect them from the dust and battle. Kale recognized the spiny Gorebaton that was dripping shadow drops from its thirsty blades. As Clymain walked over and began stomping on the door that Kale just rolled out of, Kale stared through the empty carriage towards his recent foe. The dust was still too thick, and he could see forms running and dying in the dust, but could make out none in particular. It had all happened in a matter of seconds... <BR> <BR>Later that day... <BR> <BR>Kale and Clymain continued to battle until the bandits had fled, however, most of them had indeed been killed. Or so the evidence would seem. Now the dust had settled, and the sight was a miserable one. The majority of the bandits were wearing crude leather armor, and had nothing more than short swords. Some had better weapons and equipment, which they obviously stole or took from dead victims. Kale walked over beside the other door of the carriage. It was slightly bent, and had a few drops of blood on it. Three guards were dead, and some footprints, obviously too small for a man&#39;s, headed from the door to the woods. Kale worked both of his shoulders and neck forward, the dried blood from the Caustrodon cracked and chipped from the shoulders and the chain mail. Clymain walked up with a curious look on his face, several droplets of dried blood had taken up residence on his cheek. <BR> <BR>&#34;You all right, Kale? Are you injured after all?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No. I&#39;m intrigued by one of my opponents...&#34; Kale said, returning his gaze to the battered door. <BR> <BR>Clymain traced his stare to it, then asked, &#34;You mean the one that kicked you out of the carriage?&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale looked at Clymain with eyes as cold as death. Clymain laughed, knowing all to well Kale wouldn&#39;t have been kicked out. He still liked to pick at him about such things. <BR> <BR>&#34;I know you didn&#39;t get booted out. Relax. At least we won. By the way, have you seen the Baron?&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale shook his head. Indeed, he hadn&#39;t seen the Baron since he tore out of the roof of the carriage. <BR> <BR>&#34;I wonder how many he killed...&#34; Kale muttered lightly. <BR> <BR>&#34;The guards say a lot.&#34; Clymain added, &#34;His kills are almost ripped in half, or are. That&#39;s how you know who he killed.&#34; <BR> <BR>As the pair walked around to were the Baron had jumped off, they saw a horrible sight. <BR> <BR>The Baron was there, his back to the pair, facing a little field of death. Most of the bandits were, indeed, cut in half, or had severed limbs, or exploded chests. A plain of bodies and a swamp of blood, it was almost unreal. As they approached the Baron, he turned and faced them, hood up, and all they could see was a smile with spattered blood around it. <BR> <BR>&#34;Greetings. What a glorious victory, heh?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hardly.&#34; Kale stammered as he stared at the bodies, &#34;These people were desperate, ill trained, and poorly equipped. I must compliment their abilities to even succeed with such.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Indeed.&#34; Clymain chimed in, &#34;This was a slaughter. The only reason they even succeed before now was determination to survive.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Baron Perenolde laughed and added, &#34;Agreed then. Not a glorious battle...&#34; He licked the blood around his lips, chuckled again, then corrected himself with disturbing pleasure, &#34;What a glorious slaughter....&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale blinked uncertainly at the still chuckling Baron. He slowly turned and climbed on top of the carriage, or what was left, and Clymain scurried up beside him, &#34;We&#39;ll ride up here for the remainder Baron.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;So be it. But there is no need to worry now.&#34; The Baron laughed again as he entered his doorless, sunroof carriage adding, &#34;We are in my territory now...&#34; <BR> <BR>Stay Tuned. CHB
