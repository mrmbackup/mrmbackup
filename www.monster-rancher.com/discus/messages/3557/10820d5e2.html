 Hello my readers few and far between! Here is the next part. I hope you like it! <BR> <BR>Now, let me turn my tale from me to my four companions: Thomas, Gavin, Hannah, and Kari. The first is Hannah. <BR>Deep within the heart of the Mandy Desert, there lies a small hut. Inside that small hut is a mat, but there is something under that mat. If you lift it up, there is a door. If you use the right key, the door will open. When you go through the door, flights of stairs are put before you heading down, a very long flight of stairs. At the end of the stairs, you will find a guard and his Diabolos. If the guard let’s you pass, &#40;the keyword is “IF”&#41; you shall find another flight of stairs with four guards, two Diabolos, a Naga, and a Golem. If they let you pass, you will find a Marble Guy and a Gaboo thoroughly chained to the wall. Beyond them is a cell with a young woman in it. She is also chained. She looks to be someone’s prisoner. She seems the age of about twenty. A look of despair and gloom are one of her facial features, but in the eyes, there is a flame of resistance; an eternal gleam of hope.  <BR> <BR>Just then, a man entered the small, dank room deep under the Mandy Desert. He got passed the five guards very smoothly; rather, the guards saluted him. He glided into the room, glanced at the two monsters and sneered at them. He then turned to the cell. <BR> <BR>“Ah, hello there, and how are we today? Hm, still not speaking I see, well, that really wont help your situation, now will it?” The man turned around, about to leave, when a strong and defiant voice rang out from within the cell. <BR> <BR>“Why should I talk to you, scum bucket? I only chat with people of decency.” She spat at him, which caused him to be furious. <BR> <BR>“ARRG! You shall pay for your insolence, you wretch! I tried to be nice, I try to give you a chance at salvation, but you force me to take it away. Alas, what shall I do to persuade you? Oh! I know…” A twisted smile formed on his smooth and calm features. “Let’s see what your Golem has to say, or maybe you’re maybe your nasty glob. What do you think he knows?” <BR> <BR>“NO! Stop! You sick fiend! If you lay a hand on my monsters…I’ll…. I’ll….” She was cut short. <BR> <BR>“You’ll what? You’ll stop me? All you can do is cry for help, but sadly, no one can hear you. Do you know where you are? No? That’s what I thought. So, what kind of fun shall we have with your monsters? Ooh, I know. It gets pretty hot here in the Mandy Desert. I wonder how one of them would feel after a week alone in it? Let’s see, shall we?” <BR> <BR>“NEVER!” She convulsed all over with rage. The once despaired look became tight and contorted. Her eyes burst into a flame. A stare was given to the man that would kill someone. “Jacques! You shall pay for what you have done and will do to me or any of my companions!” <BR> <BR>“You silly girl. This could all be over right now if you would just tell me what you know about the Third Soul. Why do you refuse? Sooner or later, I will find it. I’d just rather have it sooner. I could just kill you right now, and be done with it, but where would be the fun in that?” <BR> <BR>“Why should I tell you? If the Third Soul ever got into filthy hands like yours, the results would be catastrophic! You will never know. I will hold strong!” <BR> <BR>“That’s too bad… that’s too bad. Well, I apologize, miss, but I must take my leave. I have pressing business to attend to with one named Gavin. I believe you two are acquainted. Remember, you don’t have very much time left. Farewll!” <BR> <BR>Jacques left through the door, past the four guards, up a flight of stairs, past the single guard, up the first flight of stairs, into the hut, then out to the desert, and onto the back of Xavier, his Diaboros. The young woman was left in her cell. She still had that fire of defiance in her eyes.
