 My story is 1 of a mocchi and a trainer&#40;namely me&#41;.ok its short. <BR> <BR> <BR>     Just coming from Fimba I came to sign up for a new challenge a fight.Ima was next I thought to myself.Questions were asked and an assistant assigned,colt was her name,anyone would be fine. <BR>     I went to the market and scaned a disk a mocchi I found was not on the fimba continent, not knowing what it was I named it Mocchi. <BR>     Training was easy it was bad at nothing.I fought threw E class easy enough a thrust and a slap was end of E.In D class roll assault was realized and was the end of many.In C class was the longest i learned many moves, roll attack,petal swirl and many others.B class was my next stop Galis and a Jill where hardest there.A class Gotrect dominated.A quick tail assault or a roll and that was the end of mocchi until 1 month on a island errantry the move was learned.Mocchi Ray finished A class for me.5 years 6 months S class was a foot.That Joker cant take me seriously <BR>though.until I gouged my name in his mask with his scythe.Finishing S class my first monster did but upon this my mocchi&#39;s life completed. My first Ima monster was cool but now he gives me strength from where he lies to me and my nagas.A sad tale this was I liked to tell it. So the moral is never underesstimate a mocchi and his friend. <BR> <BR> <BR>How you&#39;d ya like it send comments.

 Once upon a time I met this chick named Holly. &#34;Hi,&#34; I said. &#34;I&#39;m Bill... what&#39;s your name?&#34; <BR>&#34;Holly,&#34; she said. <BR>&#34;That&#39;s a dumb name.&#34; <BR>&#34;I know.&#34; then she sat down and cried. <BR>&#34;I&#39;m sorry... I didn&#39;t mean it,&#34; I told her. &#34;Hey! what&#39;s your favorite food?&#34; <BR>&#34;roast duck.&#34; <BR>&#34;Ok, lets go find a duck.&#34; <BR>So we look all over and we couldn&#39;t find a duck. we searched and searched for almost a year when we finally found a Mocchi. <BR>&#34;Hey! that thing has a duck bill!&#34; I said. <BR>&#34;Cool,&#34; she said &#34;let&#39;s eat it.&#34; <BR>&#34;But what if it&#39;s somebody&#39;s monster?&#34; <BR>&#34;Who cares?!?! We haven&#39;t eaten nearly a year searching for a stupid duck... this thing is close enough.&#34; <BR>So we ate it and we were so hungery we didn&#39;t even cook it. We only ate half of it though, because it tasted funny... but that&#39;s alright, because we were full. Then this wierd old guy came walking up to us. <BR>&#34;Hey, have you seen a mocchi anywhere? I lost him a couple hours ago and I can&#39;t find him anywhere! Oh, I love him so much... I hope he turns up.&#34; <BR>&#34;Sure, you can have the rest, I&#39;m stuffed,&#34; said Holly. <BR>And then the old man looked at the mocchi and cried. <BR>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for your loss,&#34; said Holly. &#34;We tried to help him. But we were too late.&#34; <BR>&#34;And he tasted good,&#34; I said. A year later Holly and I got married, but then we got devorced because she ate my jell. She ate it because we ran out of jello. <BR>                     THE END
