 The mystery of the locked disks <BR> <BR>“Ugh” Jack said groggily as he climbed out of his bed. Jack was a monster trainer in his 12th year of training, and although he wasn’t a bad trainer, he wasn’t a very good one either. You see, all monsters he had trained he never had spent his full potential on them, as he always thought about greater and stronger monsters to train. So he always ended up with monster’s making B and C class, monsters that could have easily gotten A class if given more attention. After he had bathed and dressed he went to his dining room and sat down. He began to daydream of great monsters……..  <BR> <BR> Out from his cozy cabin he walked to his shed where he kept his monsters.  He opened up the two huge wooden doors and walked into the shed. “ good morning” he said half-heartedly to his current monster: a four month old gali which was named Yin. “ come on Yin, were going to town today” Yin simply backed away and whimpered. Jack could sense his monster was afraid, since gali’s were smart and could sense when they were going to be frozen. “Come on Yin! Now!” he yelled, and his gali slowly followed his master out of his shed and into town. Once there Jack and Yin headed straight for the lab.  <BR> <BR>“Hello, can I help you?” said Derrick, the worker at the lab. “Yes, I would like to freeze my gali” said Jack, his gali was now terrified. Derrick guided the gali in a special room, stepped out and hit a black button on his control panel. Immediately the air went sub-zero in the room that held the gali, and in another second the gali was frozen. “Thanks Derrick” said Jack as he walked out of the lab and then to the shrine. “yes!” jack said to himself, as now was his moment to shine. For you see, yesterday while looking threw a ruined building five miles away from his ranch, he found a fully intact white disk with a sword in-grated on it. He thought it was best not to tell his gali about it before he froze him. The shrine was located outside in a corner of the town. It was fairly big, with three different places to put your disk. Jack had been there many times before so he knew where to go.  <BR> <BR>He was greeted with a “hello Jack” from the shrine worker, Diana. “hold on just a sec Jack, I have to help Brant first” she said. Jack suddenly became nervous, he knew who Brant was, then again everyone in that town knew who Brant was. Brant was a master trainer who, as long as anyone could remember had always trained many monsters. Most people believed he was  more then one hundred years old, yet he looked like he was in his mid thirty’s. It was also widely known that his non-aging was because he had eaten many a gold peach. Jack began to sweat, whenever Brant was at the shrine, the whole town would come and watch, and that meant they would see jacks monster unlocked too, he thought that it would be really embarrassing to get just a regular monster in front of Brant and the crowd. <BR> <BR>As Brant walked up, Jack saw the disk he held and nearly screamed with joy. His disk was exactly the same as his! White with the sword, it had to be the same disk. Wow, he thought. He was going to get a great monster. Brant walked up and smiled at the shrine worker, then put his disk on one of the platforms. It began to glow and spin and stopped, then started up again and out popped none other then a durahan! Jack nearly exploded with excitement. Brant got his stats, registered his name as Dura and walked away back to the mansion he called a cabin. Jack then ran up and placed his disk in and stood back with Diana. It began to glow and spin then stop, and then Diana pushed a button and no more glowing and spinning happened. She turned to Jack looking very sorrow and said, “I’m sorry Jack but Your unable to handle this monster yet, come back with this disk after you win more tournaments.” Jack was crushed, he felt sad, mad, and very embarrassed since people were watching and whispering to each other. He walked away with tears in his eyes and ran to his ranch with no monster.  <BR> <BR>Jack cried and cried for a very long time. His sadness turned to jealousy, why was Brant able to get that durahan and not me? Why did Diana stop the disk? I could handle it! He thought these things for a long time and then started to make an evil plan. Oh yes, he would have that durahan, if it was the last thing he did, he would have it! So he dressed  in different clothes and waited for midnight to come, and when it did he grabbed his durahan disk and headed out to town.  <BR> <BR>When Jack got to town, he sneaked past the houses and to the shrine. As he looked at it he thought to himself, no stupid worker to stop me now! So as the town slept he put the disk on the platform in the middle and stood back. It began to glow and spin, then stop and start again, then out came a durahan. Jack looked at it in wonder, its armor shining against the moon. The durahan looked back and then got in charging position, it could tell Jack was a weak trainer, and he was going to make him pay for it, for this durahan was very evil, which is a rarity among durahans. Jack realized this and started to run for his life as the durahan chased him. Jack wanted to yell but was too afraid to. He started to think of a way out of this mess and then remembered about his gali that was frozen. He ran to the lab and began hitting buttons that were similar to the one Derrick had hit earlier. Finally one released his gali just in time, as the durahan was in striking distance. The Gali leaped in front of it and his master, preparing to make a bolt of lightning. But it never happened, before Yin made his attack, the durahan swung his sword and pierced through the gali’s mask, killing him instantly. Its cloak fell to the ground but his mask was still on the sword. “Yin!!!!” screamed Jack, horrified as the durahan wiped the gali’s mask off and strided froward to the trainer. It was then Jack realized he was at the back of the lab, cornered by the evil monster in front of him. “Fool!” growled the durahan, “your stupidity and lack of training skills shall cost you your life!” even as Jack screamed the durahan swung at his head with superior speed, the blade touched and slashed through the trainers neck like paper. <BR> <BR>“Nooooo!!!” screamed jack, he had awoken in the dinning room, covered in sweat. “whew” he said, “I must have fallen asleep while daydreaming” he got out of the chair he was in, relieved at finding himself alive. It was all just a dream, he had no great disk, but he did have a gali and the people in the dream were all real too. Weird, he thought to himself as he walked out of his cabin. “ It seemed way to real”, he said. From that day on he raised his monsters with full interest and attention, and was never jealous about those “greater” monsters again. He never found out however, that the “dream” he had could have been reality, if he did not change his ways.
