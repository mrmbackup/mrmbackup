Long chapter this time, so have a bit of free time before starting. <BR> <BR>--------------- <BR> <BR>Prologue: <BR> <BR>Minutes earlier, a small boy, about eleven or twelve years of age, dashed behind the enormous stands, A dripping iced cone was held in an outstretched hand, and his tiger puppy danced around his heels, eager for a lick of he sweet treat. His mother had given him a few copper coins to get himself something in between bouts, and recalling a colourful sweet stand near the entrance, he leapt at the chance. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, in his haste to get back in time for the next fight he had become lost. The walkways and stairwells were deserted – few people had left their seats after the first titanic struggle. Running up a likely-looking flight of steps, the sight at the top sent him skidding to a halt, his leather sandals kicking up a small cloud of dust and sand in the unswept corridor. <BR> <BR>About fifty yards away, two men wearing strange robes were working on a large metallic device that the boy didn’t recognize. It looked as though someone had taken a number of small round tubes and stuck them together in along line, longer than him if he were lying down. In the middle of the row was a small dial upon which red figures flashed. Instinctively, he backed into the shadows, his tiger sharing his opinion by growling lowly. For reasons beyond him, it looked…menacing. The men hadn’t noticed them yet. <BR> <BR>“Come on Mia. I don’t like them. They look scary.” <BR> <BR>The boy turned to leave, but found his path blocked by a tall figure swathed in dark blue robes. A Blue Death hung in the air next to it, perfectly motionless. <BR> <BR>“Sorry, rugrat, but you’ve seen too much.” <BR> <BR>Suddenly and without warning Mia leapt at the joker, claws outstretched, teeth bared, howling and barking furiously in her quiet, shrill voice. The boy had never seen such panic and fury from his monster before. With a flick of its wrist, the Blue Death all but disembowelled the baby tiger. It fell to the ground at the boy’s feet, dying. He sank to his knees, crying, cradling his fallen monster in his arms. <BR> <BR>“Miss your tiger, kid? Don’t worry, I can fix that.” <BR> <BR>The man drew a small metal object from his robe and pointed it at the boy. A sharp crack echoed around the corridor. Startled, the two men looked up just in time to see the figure walk out of the shadows. They saluted. <BR> <BR>“My lord, what was…?” began the first. <BR> <BR>“Nothing of importance. What is your status?” replied the robed man. <BR> <BR>“We are done here, my lord. The device will detonate in less than five minutes.” said the second. <BR> <BR>“Good. Go to your stations – you have your orders.” <BR> <BR>They saluted again. “Yes sir!” they barked in unison, before turning around and hurrying away from the figure. He watched them go before returning down the steps. <BR> <BR>“That was but an appetiser, Sunder. Your scythe will run red with blood before the day is out.” he muttered to his monster as they went. <BR> <BR>The Joker hissed with pleasure. <BR> <BR>Behind them, the melted ice-cream oozed along the ground, mingled with red. <BR> <BR>End Prologue. <BR> <BR>--------------- <BR> <BR>At the best of times, the resumption of lost consciousness is a jarring, disorientating experience. But at a time like this... <BR> <BR>The thought swam lazily through Cormac’s mind as he slowly opened his eyes. It was swiftly followed by a sharp pain that jolted his stricken senses into full awakening. A low moan escaped his lips. <BR> <BR>“Ah good, you’re awake.” came Lisa’s voice from somewhere to his left. <BR> <BR>“Ugh...unfortunately, yes.” he replied as he slowly sat up from the rough, starchy sheets. Ignoring his throbbing temples, he looked around to the origin of her voice. She was crouched at Cobalt’s feet, who had his arms outstretched, slowly following a faint blue glow that played around his metallic fingers. The same glow flowed and ebbed through the cracks in what was left of the ceiling above them. Lisa was gently unravelling the thick bandages that swathed Thenardi’s body. Cormac was shocked – Thenardi had been badly injured less than half an hour ago. <BR> <BR>“Lisa, what are you...?” he began, rising to his feet in alarm. A wave of nausea and dizziness hit him instantly, forcing him to his knees. He gasped as the world seemed to spin around him, objects stretching and pulling into strange images that wheeled through the air. Lisa and Thenardi scrambled over to him. <BR> <BR>“Oh no, I was afraid of this...Cormac? Cormac, look at me. Follow my finger...no, no good...you’re all over the place...sit back down.” She gently eased him back onto the bed. “Chances are you have a concussion, from that blow to the head that you took. I thought it was just a scratch, but it might be more.” <BR> <BR>“Concussion...blow...?” he said muzzily. Instinctively, he went to feel his forehead. A damp cloth was knotted tightly around his temples. His questing fingers returned stained red. <BR> <BR>“Don’t touch it!” admonished Lisa. She reached behind him to fasten the knot again. “Listen, it looks like you need medical attention ASAP. Cobalt’s bracing the ceiling with his force shield, so we’re in no danger of being crushed. Before he got it up you must’ve been hit by some falling rock or something. Now I need you to rest while I try and find a way out of here – the collapse blocked off the exit.” <BR> <BR>“T’enardi?” mumbled Cormac. <BR> <BR>Lisa glanced at the mew, sitting by his master with an expression of concern across his face. “I’m not sure. Most of his wounds seem to have healed or are healing as we speak. He’s weak at the moment, but seems to be pretty much okay and should be fine with some rest. I don’t know how or why, but right now we have more to worry about than convenient miracles. Now are you going to lie down?” <BR> <BR>Cormac nodded weakly as he slowly lay back on the bed. It sounded as though Lisa’s voice was coming from far away. It took a supreme effort of will to form a coherent thought.  <BR> <BR>He screwed his eyes tightly shut. Dammit, this was his mind, and there was no way he was going to let a nasty scratch disrupt his thoughts. He was stronger than that – he had to be, people could be depending on him. <BR> <BR>“Ok,” he thought to himself groggily, “Let’s go over the basics. My name is Cormac McLaughlin. My monster’s name is Thenardi. He is a mew. My friend over there – <I>There is an exit underneath this bed</I> – is called...huh?” <BR> <BR>His eyes opened in surprise. <BR> <BR>“...Th’ bed...?” <BR> <BR>Slowly, he slid off of the bed.  Thenardi leapt down beside him, as if he could sense his plans. With a heave, the two pulled the old wooden frame away from the wall, scoring a long white mark in the concrete floor. <BR> <BR>“Cormac! Thenardi! What are you two doing? You’re in no condition to...hey, what’s this?” exclaimed Lisa from over Cormac’s shoulder.  <BR> <BR>Peeking out from the edge of the bed was a large metal grille. Lisa clambered over the bed and placed both hands on the gaps between the cold iron. <BR> <BR>“...I can feel a faint breeze. This must lead outside.” <BR> <BR>She eased the grille up, the hinges protesting with a long, drawn-out squeal. She poked her head down and peered along the tunnel. <BR> <BR>“It’s a close fit, but we should all be able to squeeze through. I can’t see too far along though – it may narrow further on.” <BR> <BR>Cormac shook his head. The nausea was beginning to fade, and his head felt clearer. Pure stubbornness won out once again. <BR> <BR>“I think we should try it. We don’t know what’s happened, or if rescue is on the way. Plus, if it was an earthquake or something, then there might be others worse off than us – we might be able to help.” He spoke slowly, easing the words into place with a mind that wasn’t fully alert yet. <BR> <BR>Lisa sucked in her breath. “Right, let’s go. And I’ll ask how you knew about this later, because I get the feeling that you don’t want to discuss it now.” <BR> <BR>Cormac remained silent, because in truth he didn’t know himself. He toyed with the idea of dismissing it as intuition or even luck. But he knew that the information had been secure in his mind – he had no doubts that the grille was there – and it was as if he’d always known, in the same way that he knew that pain was bad and love was good. In the same way that he somehow knew that this passage would not narrow. He shuddered. <BR> <BR>“Come on – something’s giving me the creeps, and I’m hoping it’s the fact that we’re buried under tons of rubble…” <BR> <BR>---------- <BR> <BR>A few minutes later, the group found themselves underneath and old wooden trapdoor. Cobalt was pounding on it, but thanks to the awkward position and the fact that age had turned the timber into something harder than wood, progress was slow. The rest stood in the gloom. Lisa was staring at Cormac carefully. <BR> <BR>“...I take it that you knew the exact route through that maze of passages in the same way as the grille under the bed?” she enquired. The tone wasn’t exactly accusatory, but not jocose either. Lisa knew he was keeping something from her, and Cormac had no idea how to explain the phantom knowledge to her. <BR> <BR>“I...I’ll explain later, okay?” he said. <BR> <BR>“That’s all I ask.” <BR> <BR>A splintering noise and a shaft of dull light indicated that Cobalt’s efforts had been rewarded. Another punch and the shattered frame of the trapdoor finally gave way. Cobalt tossed it through the air to land with a crash a few feet away in a cloud of dust. Cormac peered cautiously outside. Rough stone walls stretched into the distance, a pool of dull light interrupting one. <BR> <BR>“Looks like we’re in one of the corridors around the arena...there’s a door leading out into the stands about a hundred yards away. Here, let me help you up...” <BR> <BR>Cormac pulled Lisa out of the small pit and Cobalt floated after, Thenardi sitting on his metallic body.   <BR> <BR>“Right, let’s find out what’s...” <BR> <BR>Suddenly he was jolted to one side as Thenardi tackled him with surprising force; moments before a bolt of lightning scorched the ground where he had been standing. Winded, he struggled to sit up, the corner of his eye catching a shadow flit around the corridor with amazing speed. It paused, a white glow forming just above it. The light from the lightning bolt between its palms betrayed the Silhouette’s identity, moments before the scorching missile was hurled at him. A green blur flashed before his eyes as Cobalt slashed downwards with his laser sword, deflecting the surge. <BR> <BR>Cormac, still fighting for breath, scrambled away on his hands and knees to give Cobalt more room to manoeuvre, but the Silhouette seemed intent on attacking him. She darted above the upward slash of Cobalt and dived straight at Cormac, somersaulting in mid-air so that she was attacking feet-first. At the last second, Thenardi leapt up and slashed wildly, but in his still weakened state his trademark accuracy failed him. However, his attack forced the dark pixie to swoop away at the last second. Realising that she was at a distinct disadvantage in the narrow corridor, the Silhouette backflipped over Cobalt’s swipe and flew to the portal leading out to the stands, before whirling around and raising both hands above here head.  <BR> <BR>Cobalt imposed himself in front of the others just before gouts of gold-white flame billowed out from the Pixie’s hands. His force shield held, but supporting the ceiling earlier had taken its toll. He could feel it begin to slip... <BR> <BR>Thenardi intervened. He took a deep breath and began running towards the two. In one fluid motion he leapt on top of Cobalt’s head, and again, over the deadly flames. As he soared through the air he drew his claws, hoping that the pixie would be too focused on Cobalt to see him. It almost worked. The Silhouette saw him just before he swiped, preventing a fatal wound, but he still felt his claws drag across her right cheek as she flung herself to one side. She screamed in pain and spun around, firing bolts of pure magic wildly, hatred and fury blazing in her eyes. Thenardi leapt around the corridor, bouncing off of walls and the ceiling, using the confinements of his surroundings as an advantage. <BR> <BR>“Now, Cobalt!” <BR> <BR>Cobalt’s fist smashed into the side of her head with punishing force, sending her headfirst into the wall with a sickening crack. She fell to the ground, unconscious. <BR> <BR>Cormac found his breath. “What the hell was that about?!” he gasped. He strode over to the fallen Silhouette. The only remarkable feature about her was the black headband that she wore. <BR> <BR>“Oh my God...” whispered Lisa, behind him. Cormac turned to see a sight that would surely haunt his dreams for years to come. <BR> <BR>The corridor led all the way around the stadium, about halfway above the stands. This vantage point offered a superb view of the destruction. The arena, so recently restored to its original magnificence, had been torn asunder. Trees and boulders were strewn around as though scattered by a giant, malicious hand. Great chunks of earth had been ripped out of the ground, and the wreckage was illuminated by fierce fires that burnt through the once-lush greenery. Amidst the ruins unrecognised monsters fought viciously, not just against other monsters but also against armed humans. Others lay unmoving and even from this distance Cormac knew that they never would. <BR> <BR>The marble stands were all but deserted. Countless cracks and craters speckled the once-proud tiers. Bodies lay amongst the devastation – dozens, if not hundreds, lay dead or dying. The full extent of the horror yet to be revealed, as a thick, eye-watering blanket of smoke covered the stadium. The sky mirrored the blackness below as thick, malevolent clouds poured into the sky on what had been minutes earlier a glorious summer day.  <BR> <BR>The fiercest of the fighting originated from the opposite end of the stadium – but from this distance it was impossible to distinguish friend from foe. Distant shouts and screams filtered through to them, but the smoke and dust muffled them, giving the scene an eerie, nightmarish quality. A pungent smell like nothing he had ever experienced before filled his nostrils – it was the scent of spilt blood. <BR> <BR>“What happened?” he gasped. <BR> <BR>Lisa looked at him sharply. “Find out later! Right now we’re needed! Go check the stands for survivors and see if you can treat them – you know first aid, right? I’m going to help down there!” She was already running down the damaged steps, Cobalt beside her unfolded and ready to fight. <BR> <BR>“But...” began Cormac. There was a nervous edge to Lisa’s voice he hadn’t noticed before. <BR> <BR>“You’re both too weak right now! You’d only get in the way, so just do as I say!” <BR> <BR>And with that she vaulted over the small wall at the edge of the stands, her henger following suit. <BR> <BR>Cormac stood dumbstruck. Where’d that outburst come from? Lisa was not one to take charge like that. He shook his head. Not now. He turned and jogged along the stands to look for the injured. <BR> <BR>---------- <BR> <BR>Lisa walked quickly but carefully through the wreckage. The worst of the fighting had died down, and a light drizzle was killing the fires, so the arena would soon be clear. But for the moment, without the flickering light, it was darker and murkier than ever. She couldn’t see more than a few yards in front of her. She focused on her surrounding, partially to detect any threats, but also to keep her mind occupied. She had to keep a level head, despite what might have happened. <BR> <BR>“Kid gloves are off. Don’t hold back.” she said to Cobalt. <BR> <BR>The gleaming guardian nodded. Suddenly it paused and raised a metal finger to where its lips would be. Lisa froze, straining her hearing for the faintest sound. Cobalt slowly drew his right arm back... <BR> <BR>His fingers closed around the throat of the onrushing Garu in the same moment that rough arms wrapped across Lisa’s collarbone. Alarmed for his master’s safety, Cobalt took a moment to register the black headband knotted around the attacker’s forehead, before whirling his arm round in a half-arc, pitching the Garu back into the smoke with a brief, despairing howl. It was abruptly cut off moments later, replaced with a muffled crash. <BR> <BR>But he needn’t have worried. Lisa was more than able to defend herself. She reached up and grabbed the entrapping arm, using her unseen assailant’s own momentum to pitch them over her shoulder. They landed heavily on the ground, and Lisa thrust her foot onto their neck, without sufficient force to break but with the threat of doing so obvious. <BR> <BR>“Now,” she hissed between gritted teeth, “You have five seconds to...Arithon?” <BR> <BR>“Lsa?” choked Arithon, for indeed it was he. <BR> <BR>Lisa relinquished her chokehold and helped her rival to his feet. <BR> <BR>“Cobalt, keep an eye out for any threats. Arithon, what happened?” <BR> <BR>“…They came in the middle of the second bout…” said Arithon softly, his voice choked with anguish. “There was...explosions in the stands...I saw people thrown through the air like ragdolls. Panic, and a rush for the exits...those who were too old or too weak or just unlucky were caught in the crush. Then the monsters came from nowhere, flooding into the arena in a great wave ...they attacked the civilians, the guards, their monsters – anything they caught, they killed...We tried to fight, but they took our monsters with that…that hideous noise...” <BR> <BR>Lisa held the old man’s shoulders as tears rolled down his cheeks. “Why are you down here? You could be hurt, especially without...where’s Balkaroth?” <BR> <BR>Another sob erupted from Arithon’s lips. “I...I saw Balkaroth turn away from me...I saw him strike down helpless people...and I saw the confusion and terror on his face as he did so...there was no way I could run and hide while my golem, my friend, did such awful things...” <BR> <BR>Lisa glanced up. The smoke was beginning to disperse, aided by a stiff breeze. The rain was becoming heavier, and a distant roll of thunder promised a storm was near.  <BR>“Look, Arithon, I’m sorry about what’s happened but I need more details. How many monsters? What noise are you talking about?” <BR> <BR>But the trainer was inconsolable. “I’d rather have died before I saw this day...” he moaned. <BR> <BR>“Then die you shall.” growled a voice from the dark. <BR> <BR>Arithon gasped as a black blade sprouted from his chest. His fingers dug into Lisa’s shoulders momentarily before loosening and falling away as he crashed to the ground. His blood-flecked lips whispered a final prayer to the air, before his life slipped away. <BR> <BR>Lisa looked down at the spear shaft emerging from the dead man’s back, aghast. Her horror was swiftly overcome by fury.  <BR> <BR>“Coward!” she screamed. “Striking down a defenceless old man from behind, have you no honour!?”  <BR> <BR>The fog remained silent. Unseen, another spear was drawn and aimed at her heart. <BR> <BR>---------- <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, Cormac leant over another body and checked for a pulse, even though the pale colour of the flesh all but confirmed his fears beforehand. <BR> <BR>“No, she’s gone.” He muttered to himself. He straightened up and dusted his hands off. Thenardi stood nearby, scanning further tiers for any signs of movement. <BR> <BR>Cormac sighed. He had never seen a dead body before today, but didn’t feel afraid, nor was he repelled by the carnage. He felt sorrow for the victims and their kin, as well as fury for the murderers, and that was all. It surprised him. <BR> <BR>“Anything, Thenardi?” he asked. <BR> <BR>Thenardi growled and pointed. Cormac squinted and could just about make out shadowy figures dashing along the tiers, towards the main exit in the north stand of the stadium.  <BR> <BR>“Could they be the ones responsible?” <BR> <BR>He felt his fists clench, both in anger at the figures, and at his own inability to stop them. The anger swiftly passed, and he sighed, offering a silent prayer to any gods that may be listening for deliverance of those whom had lost their lives today. <BR> <BR>His prayers were interrupted by Thenardi, who tugged on his sleeve and pointed frantically with a claw. He looked up, and saw, a couple of hundred yards away, a wooden door shatter underneath a human foot. A man clambered awkwardly out, and turned and gesture for something to follow. Cormac had seen enough. He leapt to his feet and began to run towards the man – this could be his chance to stop at least one of the murderers, and he would not let it pass. <BR> <BR>He was about fifty yards away when the man glanced up and saw him and Thenardi pounding towards him. Cormac skidded to a halt, knowing that Thenardi would be better suited for any battles – his monster was close to full fighting strength again. Whatever had healed his body had restored his vigour with the same incredible speed. <BR> <BR>But he was unprepared for what happened next. The man shouted out a brief command and the brick wall beside the door exploded in a shower of mortar and stone underneath a powerful insectoid fist. Thenardi leapt backwards to avoid the worst of the barrage, executing a three-quarter somersault to land lightly on his feet, prepared to attack again. <BR> <BR>The Centurion clambered out of the hole that it had made for itself, and seeing his foe essentially unharmed, crouched into a fighting stance. Thenardi drew his claws and tensed, ready to leap. <BR> <BR>“Wait!” cried the man. Cormac recognised the reedy, petulant voice. <BR> <BR>“Fitzroy?” he called back. <BR> <BR>The distant figure nodded, and strode towards him. “Yes. You are one of the contestants, are you not? Cormac, wasn’t it?” <BR> <BR>“That’s right.” Cormac realised that the door beside him was the entrance to the presidential suite where the tournament’s organiser had been residing. <BR> <BR>Fitzroy glanced at Thenardi. “Has your monster not been coerced?” <BR> <BR>“What do you mean?” <BR> <BR>“They,” Fitzroy gestured towards the chaos, “Used some manner of device to take control all artificial monsters. All of the combatants, as well as any artificial monsters within the arena, were taken. Why wasn’t yours?” <BR> <BR>“Wait...all of them? Every single one? How non-artificials were left?” asked Cormac hurriedly.  <BR> <BR>“There was some token defence offered by the stadium guards, but they were not prepared for an uprising of this magnitude. I was not able to fully observe the fighting as I escorted Master Ghubs to a place of safekeeping as soon as the explosions started, but we were ambushed in the corridors and he was taken. Myself and Jamuura barely escaped with our lives, something for which I am truly ashamed.” <BR> <BR>“My God...Lisa’s in there by herself, and even if Cobalt hasn’t been taken over she doesn’t stand a chance!” <BR> <BR>“But you can’t save her. If whoever’s responsible for this brings their full forces to bear, then you’re both doomed. The Kanturk militia should be here soon, and they should be able to get the situation under control. It would be prudent to wait before doing anything foolish.” <BR> <BR>“I don’t care. I’d never forgive myself if Lisa got hurt and I did nothing. You can cower back here until things are safer, but I can’t stand idly by and watch someone I care about die.” <BR> <BR>He turned and began to sprint down the steps. Thenardi ran alongside him, sharing his master’s grim resolve. They were sure that the time of their death was at hand. But they knew that there was no one else they would rather die beside. <BR> <BR>Cormac heard footsteps to his left. Fitzroy appeared at his shoulder, the same calm but determined expression on his face.  <BR> <BR>“I have been shamed once today by my actions. I will not allow it a second time. Allow me to lend you my strength.” <BR> <BR>Cormac nodded. Once again, he felt no fear, just a strange sense of resolution, as if though this is the way things should be. <BR> <BR>“ Let’s do it.” <BR> <BR>--------------- <BR> <BR>Leon and Tessa emerged from the shadows of the ruined suite. <BR> <BR>“Dammit, I can’t believe that he’s going back!” groaned Leon. Harlequin stood by him, sharing his trainer’s anxiety. He growled lowly, drawing and sheathing his claws again and again. <BR> <BR>“He’s going to save his best friend. Can you blame him? Would you not do the same thing in his position?” replied Tessa softly. Beside her the vivid eyes of her Plauna glittered in the darkness. <BR> <BR>“Not if I knew the stakes that were involved.” <BR> <BR>“And whose fault is that? I know that you prefer stealth and caution above all else, but there are times when hiding knowledge is more than folly – it can be fatal.” <BR> <BR> Leon sighed. “Come on – though we must avoid battle at all costs, we cannot let him die. Let’s pray that help arrives swiftly, or all may be lost…” <BR> <BR>---------- <BR> <BR>Lisa stood defiant. <BR> <BR>“Well? Do you fear helpless girls as well, murderer?” <BR> <BR>Concentrating, she became aware of a whispered but heated conversation somewhere beyond her. Cobalt stood by her side, ready to ward off any attacks from the haze, but he couldn’t be everywhere at once, and Lisa felt horribly exposed. <BR> <BR>After what seemed like an eternity, an indistinct figure stepped out of the mists. Lisa thought she could hear other footsteps drift away. <BR> <BR>“I’m impressed. You have courage beyond your years.” <BR> <BR>“That, and more besides!” Lisa snarled. “Cobalt, get ready to…” <BR> <BR>The man raised a gloved hand. “Stop. Do not force me to kill you. You have courage, but do not think that you are free from the same fate that befell the old man. Don’t be foolish and you may see another day.” <BR> <BR>“Why you dirty son of a…” <BR> <BR>A sigh. “You are becoming irritating. I should let you know that the only thing that is stopping me from killing you is the fact that your monster still obeys your commands. Although a minor problem today, if others could do the same then I may have a problem in the future. Therefore it would be best to deal with it now.” <BR> <BR>Lisa remained silent, desperately racking her brains for a solution to her predicament. Blind courage had gotten her into this mess, and she hoped that it would get her out again. The cowled figure raised a hand to his left temple. <BR> <BR>“Hm. It seems that the militia will be arriving soon. I could order you struck down where you stand, but I feel a little exercise is in order. So I will give the order to retreat…” - he paused for a moment - “...there. And now I’m free to take care of you myself. Sunder, to my side!” <BR> <BR>As if on cue, an intense gust of wind tore the smoke and fog away from the ground, forcing Lisa to shield her eyes. When she opened them again, the man stood before her in all of his dark glory. Tall and powerfully built, as least as was obvious through the inky-blue robes, which, caught in the gales, whipped and pulled around his body, masking any other details. Any other, save an almost palpable aura of evil that made her shudder. <BR> <BR>Beside him stood a Blue Death, which shared the same powerful poise and malicious spirit as its owner. The mocking face on its mask glinted eerily in the half-light, raindrops running from its eyes like false tears. Any that struck its wicked blade were sliced in two before splashing onto the sodden ground. Slowly it extended its scythe until the tip pointed directly at Cobalt. Lisa recognised the gesture – He would not stop until his quarry was dead. <BR> <BR>Cobalt stepped in front of Lisa. A flash of light illuminated the arena briefly as he willed his laser sword into existence. An answering flash of light burst from the heavens as a bolt of lightning split the sky in two. The rain pounded out of the sky in torrents, stinging any exposed skin. <BR> <BR>“You’ll have to forgive me for the weather, but I must confess of a streak of theatrics in my blood!” shouted the robed man above the wind. “Now, tell me, little girl, do your battle skills match your courage?” <BR> <BR>Lisa flashed a mad grin. “Time for both of us to find out!” <BR> <BR>Cobalt stepped forward, twirling his shining blade around his body in a breathtaking display of skill. With a sudden flourish, he stabbed forward with incredible speed. A flash of sparks was tossed into the inky blackness as Sunder deflected the lunge up and away with the shaft of his scythe before whirling the blade back around in a deadly arc. Cobalt leapt awkwardly, but stomped down as the weapon passed below him, trapping it beneath his foot. He slashed wildly, but Sunder ducked beneath the blow and smashed Cobalt in the chest with his fist, staggering his opponent and freeing his scythe. <BR> <BR>Cobalt, winded slightly, decided to try a different tactic. Raising both fists, he allowed his robotic senses to target his foe, before flinging ruby lasers from the gauntlets around his fists. Unperturbed, Sunder almost seemed to dance around the lasers, flitting his way between them with troubling ease. Lisa, even in this desperate situation, could not help but be impressed by the joker’s economy of movement – he knew exactly when and where to dodge, and moved not a second too soon nor an inch too far. <BR> <BR>Cobalt did not share his master’s admiration. Despite his best efforts, the joker was slowly advancing amidst the maelstrom of missiles. He was forced to retreat, firing all the while, his frustration increasing with every wasted volley. Suddenly, with the swiftness of a snake, Sunder struck out with his scythe, carving the air with a terrible tearing sound. Cobalt ceased firing and hurled himself backwards, but not before a thin slice of metal had been sliced out of his chestplate. <BR> <BR>Fingering the slash, Cobalt glanced upwards. The joker hung in the air, mockingly. Cobalt knew that it was toying with him, testing the limits of his abilities. If so, it was time to show him what he could do. <BR> <BR>In one fluid motion Cobalt stood up and lashed out with a swift left hook. Sunder took the blow on his arm, before countering with a straight punch to the face. Cobalt jerked his head to one side and caught the clenched fist with his free hand. Seizing the advantage, he brought his other arm round in an open handed-chop aimed at Sunder’s neck. Sunder thrust his scythe into the path and relinquished his grip. Cobalt’s hand struck the shaft, which twirled the scythe around like a fan, forcing him back. <BR> <BR>Cobalt leapt forward with a vicious kick as Sunder caught his weapon. Under pressure, the joker managed to deflect the blow, removing most of the force. Pressing his advantage, Cobalt lashed out again with his other leg. This time, lightning reflexes enabled the Blue Death to catch the upturned foot. With a heave, he tossed it into the air, forcing Cobalt into an ungainly somersault. Landing awkwardly, the metal guardian was defenceless as twin bolts of dark energy smashed into face and then chest, pitching him through the darkness before crashing into the mud by the arena wall with punishing force. <BR> <BR>Lisa swore under her breath. <BR> <BR>Cobalt struggled to his feet, using the rough wall for support. The thick, viscous mud clung to his limbs. The joker was slowly advancing towards him, scythe upraised, ready to kill. Cobalt prepared to fire his lasers again, knowing it was useless, not caring that it was. Deciding to try quality over quantity, Cobalt fired a single, powerful beam. With a nonchalant swing of the scythe, Sunder deflected the missile away into the darkness, a distant explosion flaring briefly. Cobalt fired again, and this time the beam was knocked right back at him, forcing him to twist to one side to avoid being struck. Sunder was only a few yards away, and the final shot was accompanied by a whisper of prayer from Lisa in the dark.  <BR> <BR>The wall above Sunder cracked as the laser crashed into it, a shower of dust falling on him. A chilling laughter emanated from the mask.  <BR> <BR>It was cut off as a torrent of water crashed down from the heavens on the surprised joker, blinding and choking it. Stunned, Cobalt looked up and realised the last laser had shattered the low wall that ran around the length of the arena. All of the torrential rain that had landed in the stands flowed down to the wall, building up. Now it had an exit. <BR>  <BR>Leaping up, Cobalt clung to the crumbling wall with one hand and raised his other above the stream. With a mechanical shout, he plunged it into the deluge. As the torrent passed his hand it was turned into scalding steam, enveloping Sunder in a searing blanket of whiteness.  A horrible scream filled the air as he groped blindly through the scorching air, desperately searching for escape. Cobalt hung on grimly, feeling the pain encompass his own hand, tempered by the fact that his opponent was coming off far worse. <BR> <BR>A vice-like grip fastened itself around his ankle. With a sickening lurch he was flung across the arena, his vision blurring as he spun through the air. A tremendous shock of pain coursed through his body as he slammed into the wall on the opposite side of the arena, a full five hundred yards away. He slid through the ground, moaning in agony. Nothing moved, nothing worked – he was utterly helpless. <BR> <BR>Lisa ran to his side, tears welling up inside of her. She knelt next to him and tried to ease him into a sitting position.  <BR> <BR>“Oh, Cobalt…you almost did it, you almost had him…I am so proud of you. Just rest now, okay…? I’ll take care of it from here…I won’t let them take you….” The words were rushed, garbled. <BR> <BR>She took a deep breath and turned. The robed man stood behind her, and Sunder by him, angry burn marks covering his arms and mask.   <BR> <BR>“Impressive…few have lasted so long against Sunder, let alone cause him harm. Impressive, but not enough. Now stand aside.” <BR> <BR>Lisa didn’t move. <BR> <BR>“Unless…I have use for such gifted ranchers as yourself. Would you be interested in joining my cause? You have seen first-hand the power that I possess – it too could be yours.” <BR> <BR>She spat at his feet. “Never.” <BR> <BR>The man sighed. “Such a waste of talent. At least some of the other trainers had more sense. Take Neil, for example – there’s a boy who’s going places.” <BR> <BR>“Neil…agreed to follow you?” <BR> <BR>“Oh, have I touched a nerve? No matter, you won’t care in a moment. Sunder, kill her.” <BR> <BR>“No!” <BR> <BR>The cry erupted from the gloom. Sunder was thrown to one side as a furry golden missile struck him in the face, before flipping backwards to reveal itself as Thenardi. He growled and launched himself forwards straight at Sunder, claws gleaming in the cimmerian light. Cormac appeared next to Lisa. <BR> <BR>“Are you alright?” <BR> <BR>“I may never be ‘all right’ again, but I’m not hurt – now look out for that joker. I’ve never seen a monster like it.” <BR> <BR>Cormac nodded and turned, just in time to see Thenardi hurtling through the air the way he had come. Landing feet first, he skidded through the mud before finally stopping. A vivid blue-black bruise was already forming on his cheek. He growled and prepared to leap again. <BR> <BR>“You?” gasped Cormac and the cowled man in unison as they caught sight of each other properly. Cormac was stunned, and for once the man seemed unsure. <BR> <BR>“Weren’t you…?” began Cormac. <BR> <BR>“In your dream?” he interrupted. “No…because that would be impossible, wouldn’t it? Anyway, your presence here complicates matters – you’re far to valuable to kill, and I don’t have time to deal with you properly. So I guess I’ll have to cut my losses and leave. I’m sure we’ll meet again. But then again, you knew that already, didn’t you? Sunder, we’re leaving!” <BR> <BR>The joker hissed a curse but glided to his master’s side. Cormac struggled through the ankle-deep mud, determined for answers. <BR> <BR>“Wait!” he cried, leaping forwards. The pair shot into the air, leaving him wallowing in the quagmire. Thenardi skidded to a halt next to him. The cowled man laughed spitefully at the Cormac’s futile attempt as he floated serenely about ten feet above the ground. Then he pointed a robed hand at Lisa. <BR> <BR>“See, now, what you have forsaken!” he shouted to her as he and his joker drifted away through the rain. Cormac struggled to his feet, squinting as the dark figures vanished into the murk. <BR> <BR>A frantic buzzing erupted over Cormac’s head. He wheeled around and looked up, blinking through the downpour. Fitzroy balanced on the back of his beaklon, standing against the full force of the wind. <BR> <BR>“I’ll follow him and try to slow him down! You two wait here for the militia to arrive!” he called to Cormac. <BR> <BR>“Alright! Be careful!” Cormac yelled back. <BR> <BR>Fitzroy nodded and turned his attention to his fleeing foe. A whispered command set Jamuura on her way, into the darkness. Cormac and Thenardi trudged back to Cobalt and Lisa. <BR> <BR>“Cobalt’s badly hurt.” Lisa said urgently. “He needs medical help, and soon.” <BR> <BR>Cormac looked around the arena. The rain was finally beginning to ease, and the sun lurked behind the clouds, searching for an escape. <BR> <BR>“He’s probably not the only one.” he replied. <BR> <BR>His body went numb as a thumb was jabbed into his neck. His legs, no longer capable of supporting him, slid away as strong but gentle arms picked him up as easily as a child. Lisa rose to her feet in alarm, but stopped as she caught sight of Cormac’s bearer. <BR> <BR>“Leon?” <BR> <BR>Leon nodded. “We’ve got to go. Now. A lot of questions will be asked, but not all should be answered.” He looked down at Cormac. “Don’t worry, you’re among friends now. Tessa?” <BR> <BR>Cormac felt as though his mind was wrapped in a pleasant fog. He was only vaguely aware of the swift conversation between Lisa and Leon, or the medic from earlier, apparently called Tessa, holding Thenardi carefully in her arms, like he was some kind of delicate object. <BR> <BR>Eventually the talking stopped, and the group congregated around Cobalt, still slumped against the wall. The medic tossed a small marble-like object into the air, where it exploded harmlessly but brightly, plastering the arena with shadows. Leon stepped backwards, into the wall; blackness filled Cormac’s vision as he mercifully passed out. <BR> <BR>--------------- <BR> <BR>Sorry bout delay between chapters, but exams and stuff happened, the usual. With a bit of luck they&#39;ll be a bit more frequent from here on in.

 Heh, I was just reading the series yesterday, and wondering if you had given up or something, since there hadn&#39;t been one for some time. Anyway, I love your writing here and hope you do continue. =D
