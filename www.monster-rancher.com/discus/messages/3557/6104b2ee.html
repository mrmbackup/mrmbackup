 -Without further adue, I bring you the final chapter, I hope you enjoy the last installment of Elements- <BR> <BR> <BR>Roketh stood solemn and unmoving. The only presence of life was the rise and fall of his  <BR>massive shoulders. The Dragon held his scythe rather loosely, breathing very hard. If he was  <BR>tired or full of rage, Kronock couldn&#39;t tell, yet he still guessed both. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hm hm hm...&#34;, Kronock almost mocked him now, as his new-found &#39;hands&#39; felt across the  <BR>ground, begging him to unleash them, &#34;So...enough?&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh merely stood there, as if waiting to die. Kronock was more than a bit puzzled by this  <BR>action. Roketh was strong, not as strong as him, but strong enough and determined enough not to  <BR>surrender so easily. <BR> <BR>&#34;....fool.&#34; Kronock said slowly with a small grunt. His tendrils came to life at these words,  <BR>slicing through the air with anticipation of their soon to be purchase. <BR> <BR>Still. Roketh was utterly stonic, not even flinching at the site. Even his mighty shoulders had  <BR>stopped moving very much, only a faint movement could be detected of him now, his eyes. <BR> <BR>Roketh&#39;s eyes had always given away his mood. This time was no exception. Kronock could not  <BR>peer directly into his foe&#39;s sockets, for his head was limply on his neck, hanging forward. As if  <BR>he could crack the very planet with that stare. Kronock could, however, see a faint, dancing light  <BR>on Roketh&#39;s cheeks. As if a rainbow was galloping across Roketh&#39;s face, yet he still stared  <BR>forever down. <BR> <BR>Kronock was beginning to get a little less confident and a bit more fearful of this stance. Perhaps  <BR>he was thinking over strategies? Maybe last rights for his weakling accomplices? He was a fool  <BR>either way, Kronock was unstoppable now, the Amalgam as he referred to himself. The perfect  <BR>being that assimilated every breed into him, even man. Still, even now, there was one that stood  <BR>against him, one that still, even with all his power, was still poised to send it all crashing back  <BR>to the ground. Kronock wouldn&#39;t have it, not ever! <BR> <BR>With one wicked scream Kronock slung his left arm over his head and behind him. He then slung  <BR>it towards the patient Dragon. Still Roketh stood his ground, forever unimpressed. <BR> <BR>Then, the tentacles struck with all the force they had been building up, and Roketh...shattered?  <BR>Chips and pieces fell to the ground, breaking again and again, like an endless hall of vases  <BR>falling. <BR> <BR>&#34;What?!&#34; Kronock exclaimed. <BR> <BR>He turned to look behind him, ready to fight. Nothing. He turned a complete circle, then  <BR>backtracked half of one, to find nothing. He was gone. Ran away? Not likely, this battle would  <BR>decide the fate of the world, and more. He would not just flee. <BR> <BR>Still nothing. He had utterly vanished. Kronock looked about him and above him frantically. He  <BR>decided to investigate his statue. The feet were about the only thing still intact, other then his  <BR>head a few inches away. Kronock stomped on it with a vengeance, infuriated that his was  <BR>foolish enough to be deceived. In the heel of each foot, resided a small hole. <BR> <BR>&#34;But...how?...and where?&#34; Kronock still asked. <BR> <BR>Then, the ground under those holes exploded, catching Kronock completely off guard. He  <BR>stumbled back, being mere inches from that explosion. He stopped and stared into the dust that  <BR>was falling around him now. He saw a faint, pink glow rising. He was confused by this, had  <BR>something killed Roketh? The pink rose and fell as it bobbed towards him. It rose one final time,  <BR>higher than before. Then, it was speeding at Kronock&#39;s face. Kronock never had time to react as  <BR>a pink endowed fist tore through the debris and slammed into Kronock&#39;s jaw. He was now  <BR>slightly air born, almost hovering, backwards. The ground under him exploded again, this time  <BR>the Dragon did appear, standing beside the horizontal villain. <BR> <BR>Roketh raised his right knee as hard as he could into the small of Kronock&#39;s back, and powered  <BR>his right hand up again. Kronock&#39;s body bowed and his head fell back slightly. Roketh spiked his  <BR>punch into the bottom of Kronock&#39;s chin, sending him one flip off Roketh&#39;s knee and into the  <BR>ground. Roketh grabbed his leg as he laid face down on the harsh, unforgiving earth. With one  <BR>swift toss, Kronock was flying. One could say almost gracefully. Roketh went into his bag of  <BR>tricks and pulled one out he hadn&#39;t used since his first encounter with Nightmare. <BR> <BR>A blue disk materialized into his palm, made of water. On the edge, were small but in quite a  <BR>large number, liquid and ice spikes. Roketh merely glanced at it, then at the floating visage of  <BR>Kronock, and threw it as hard as he could. The disk sped for Kronock, who was still a bit off  <BR>centered. Then, the tendrils lashed out and shattered the disk in mid air. In all actuality, this  <BR>didn&#39;t make his situation any better. <BR> <BR>Kronock was kind of dumbfounded by Roketh&#39;s assault, but felt a little better smashing a  <BR>finishing move. Kronock was as surprised as Roketh, but not quite as pleased, as the shards and  <BR>spikes of the disk still hit him. The volley pierced him indefinitely. Like a bag of needles had  <BR>been thrown at his whole being. Kronock screamed, for even being a super monster, he still felt  <BR>pain. And he had never felt it this strong. Roketh smiled, almost laughing as Kronock landed on  <BR>the ground softly, contrary to his size. <BR> <BR>&#34;...luck. Dumb...luck, everyone...has it.&#34; Kronock spoke slowly as the shards slowly melted and  <BR>ran down his body. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know about your luck part.&#34; roketh said, still smiling. <BR> <BR>&#34;You insult...me? You...would...challenge...my intellect?&#34; Kronock still sound breathless, though  <BR>Roketh knew it wasn&#39;t the case as he said, &#34;I have...devoured&#40;Deep breathe&#41;Undines, Katos,  <BR>Pixies, Suezos, Tigers, Monols, Galis, and the smartest Human alive, and...you would...question  <BR>my...intellegence?&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh sobered instantly at the remembrance of Dadge. This creature will be destroyed and,  <BR>hopefully, set free all his captives. Even if he couldn&#39;t free them, killing them would still be  <BR>saving them. Roketh&#39;s grip could have broken any material now, save the Demon scythe. <BR> <BR>Kronock grew a bit more wary as every second passed. Roketh was a force to be reckoned  <BR>with, but if he could be absorbed...think of his power then! Kronock smiled happily at his new  <BR>plan. Kronock&#39;s appendages shot out at Roketh once more, this time totally affirmed to tasting  <BR>blood, not hardened clay. With one swift slash upwards, they were severed and Roketh was  <BR>crouched, running at his foe. The tendrils rapidly replaced themselves and rained on Roketh. For  <BR>all his speed, he failed to escaped their embrace. <BR> <BR>Two of Kronock&#39;s new weapons wrapped around his feet, another about his waist. The second  <BR>hand tentacles fell on Roketh like whips, gingerly snipping off patches of orange like Dragon  <BR>hide as they fell. They struck three times, then wrapped around his arms, and one around the  <BR>neck. <BR> <BR>Roketh was on one knee, facing his jailer. His scythe had been dropped mere inches from his  <BR>left hand and, for all his might, he could not reach it. Kronock slowly strolled to Roketh  <BR>location, chuckling with utter joy at the fact he had now won. <BR> <BR>&#34;Roketh...you lose...&#34; Kronock said, Roketh&#39;s gaze was down, yet again. &#34;No, no...that trick  <BR>won&#39;t work...again...&#34; <BR> <BR>The tendrils tightened slightly and roketh flinched, so Kronock knew he was still there, head  <BR>down. <BR> <BR>&#34;Poor Roketh...can&#39;t even...look...at his...superior?&#34; Kronock was so happy he could explode. <BR> <BR>Roketh&#39;s eyes were, in fact, closed. Kronock could barely see his eyes, and there was now  <BR>prancing light to be seen. Kronock did note a slight red vapor coming up and around Roketh&#39;s  <BR>jaw and dissipating into the air, but he thought, being a Dragon, this was a sign of defeat. <BR> <BR>&#34;Come...now...&#34; Kronock mocked, &#34;Look upon...your master before...we...become...I.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kronock chuckled slightly at his own joke, but Roketh muttered something, barely audible. <BR> <BR>Kronock nodded slightly and said, &#34;Come...again...?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;If you insist.&#34; Roketh&#39;s voice was very muffled, like his mouth was full. Before Kronock could  <BR>ponder this Roketh&#39;s head shot up and his eyes blazed open. Kronock only managed to draw in  <BR>one breathe as the Dragon&#39;s red, pulsating eyes locked onto him, and the red net that covered  <BR>Roketh&#39;s maw began to expand. <BR> <BR>Roketh&#39;s entire vision was red, as if he was in a sea of blood. The balloon filled up quicker than  <BR>ever, and the Demon Flare attack was well under way. This one was larger than any before it,  <BR>and now it snatched up a speechless Kronock in its hands. The tentacles, luckily, had went limp  <BR>at the shock, and were pulled along beside the fire beast. <BR> <BR>Then, it stopped. It stopped in the air and held Kronock in two hands. The villain fought  <BR>furiously against the grip, to no avail. Roketh&#39;s sight pulled up into view, about five yards in  <BR>front of Kronock&#39;s new cage. <BR> <BR>Kronock&#39;s mouth went slack as he saw the unimaginable. Roketh&#39;s body shook violently as  <BR>several bulges appeared on his form. They broke off and formed monstrous shapes. One turned  <BR>into a Pressure, another turned into a Hercules, another turned into a gold and diamond Durahan,  <BR>and another turned into a very familiar Hydra. <BR> <BR>&#34;The...Eight Lords!&#34; Kronock cried. <BR> <BR>Indeed, the lords were forming, not actually them, but each held their respected powers. They  <BR>slowly encircled the beastly prison of Kronock. Kronock frantically searched the horizon,  <BR>expecting an unknown source of help. None came. He was utterly alone, and outclassed. <BR> <BR>&#34;We will now preside on the Trail of Kronock.&#34; Roketh spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;What!? You mock me!? The mighty Kronock!?&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, he strained for all he was worth, cracking his confines. the Demon Flare lowered his  <BR>head slightly, looking at its captive struggle. Kronock screamed one good time and broke both of  <BR>its hands. He spun and opened one hand towards the monstrosity. A large, black orb, twice as  <BR>big as Kronock appeared. It collided with the fire being with amazing force. It did not explode,  <BR>however, but rather engulfed the beast. The creature attempted to self detonate, and did. It was  <BR>too late. It went off inside a large purple circle now, totally encased. <BR> <BR>Kronock laughed as the neon ball filled with flame. It was actually quite pretty, considering.  <BR>Kronock did, however, underrate the strength of the attack. A crack ran down the ball, fire  <BR>spraying forth like a trapped geyser. Then, small sections blew off, venting the flames. One  <BR>blew and slammed into Kronock, yet to everyone&#39;s amazement, Kronock acted as if nothing had  <BR>hit him, and continued to stand in the fire&#39;s fury. <BR> <BR>It did die down, then the orb disappeared into nothing. Kronock turned to look at Roketh.  <BR>however, unbenounced to him, Roketh was already on his way. A large dragon foot slammed  <BR>into him at an angle. Kronock flew into the ground, but landed on his feet, crouched. The ground  <BR>around him imploded and sunk in with all his force. He was hurting, bad. This battle was taking  <BR>its toll, but he could only hope it was exerting the same to his opposition. <BR> <BR>He looked up, and was horrified. The lords were circling Roketh, who was barreling towards  <BR>Kronock. Each lord was now lit up with their elemental color. The Phoenix was red, the  <BR>Pressure was blue, the Hydra was white, etc. Roketh, now he was a site. He radiated all of  <BR>them, represented them, even evil&#39;s true form. <BR> <BR>Kronock managed to peer directly into Roketh&#39;s eyes. In contrast to Kronock&#39;s now totally  <BR>fearful expression, was the unchanging, unregretting eyes of Roketh. They were like glass now,  <BR>no pupils. They were totally indifferent to Kronock&#39;s presence, seeming to gaze into him and  <BR>through him, through all time. The circling deities got faster, forming a barely viable ball around  <BR>Roketh. <BR> <BR>Kronock knew what was to happen, but couldn&#39;t even scream as the attack came on to him. At  <BR>the last second, he caught its name, as Roketh muttered the instrument of both of their  <BR>destruction&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Roketh&#39;s eyes were now as empty as Kronock&#39;s soul as he slowly said, &#34;Justice Charge.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kronock held up both hands and actually caught the ball. It pressed into him, he pressed into the  <BR>earth, such force they may have well shifted the planet. Kronock felt his feet sinking into the  <BR>solid earthen floor. Kronock could only mutter, &#34;No...&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh gazed into his eyes, it seemed like an eternity, &#34;I am the final weapon of good, and I will  <BR>stop you, even if it takes this.&#34; <BR> <BR>The explosion was unprecedented. A white wave rolled across the land in all directions. Trees  <BR>were uprooted and dissolved into nothing, as did everything else it touched. After a while, the  <BR>light faded, then began to shrink back to its origin. In a large crater, the form of a Dragon lie  <BR>helpless and unconscious, maybe dead. <BR> <BR>Roketh&#39;s eyes barely opened, but he knew he was a dead one anyway. He let his head limply  <BR>roll to his right. A smoldering suit of armor was scattered across the hole, with one almost  <BR>naked human form laying in the center, if any could be named, of the debris. It flinched slightly,  <BR>then rose. Roketh was shocked to see Dadge rise. It was actually him. Then, a thin, white beam  <BR>of pure light shot through his chest. Dadge gasped, then fell back, dead again. <BR> <BR>Roketh half leaned up with a slight, &#34;No...&#34; <BR> <BR>He immediately shot his stared to his left, where and angel stood with one outreached hand, &#34;He  <BR>was not meant to survive.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh staggered to his feet, a struggle to e sure, and one he never achieved for long. He  <BR>collapsed back to one knee and continued to stare at the creature, &#34;You, you saved me in the  <BR>pits?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It wasn&#39;t your time to go...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;And what justifies you to kill or let live?!&#34; Roketh tried to scream, but sounded more like a  <BR>deep whine. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am the overseer. One could say, I am your version of God.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;But why?&#34; Roketh spoke weakly, &#34;Why all the death, and why Dadge? Why not me?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Because you are not finished.&#34; She was very dainty, and articulate, but never seemed to speak  <BR>down to him. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, I am...&#34; Roketh said as he fell back on his left arm, for his right was in a lot of pain. &#34;I&#39;m  <BR>just gonna sit here and die now...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No...You deserve your reward, you can live.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Reward?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, my dear champion of the Realm. I do mean this Realm of the Universe. You saved this  <BR>planet. It would have been either you or Kronock to be my champion, but I&#39;m glad you won.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh was speechless, almost. &#34;A game...&#34;, he muttered. <BR> <BR>&#34;No, not a game. This is quite serious. You saved this realm, for you receive one wish now.  <BR>Anything. Kronock would have wished for power, so I&#39;m glad you were victorious. I&#39;m required  <BR>to give my strongest warrior a place at my side. That&#39;s you, and one wish for you.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh stared at her blankly, &#34;Your the real thing, aren&#39;t you?&#34; <BR> <BR>She smiled, one that almost melted Roketh, &#34;One wish, for you are the new defender of this  <BR>realm.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Bring them back.&#34; Roketh whispered, &#34;Bring them all back.&#34; <BR> <BR>She smiled, brightly this time, as if that was the answer she wanted more than any. There was a  <BR>bright flash of white that engulfed Roketh&#39;s vision. He reappeared into a town, one he  <BR>remembered slightly. They stopped here, him, Vyger, and Jace. <BR> <BR>&#34;Momma?!&#34; A young child screamed. <BR> <BR>Roketh turned to see a mother and child crying in an embrace only found in family. The child  <BR>was sobbing, in-between breathes saying, &#34;I thought...the purple...dragon killed you...&#34; <BR> <BR>The mother could only reply, &#34;So did I...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey champ.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh turned to see them all there, everyone. Moonshadow and Galin stood there, along with  <BR>Dadge, Jace, even War and Slayer&#39;s gang. All the Lords were there, except Dante, Lord of  <BR>Earth. A new, less corruptible guardian would be chosen. <BR> <BR>After a brief bit a reminiscing and thanks, they all went up to the battlefield where Bloodlust and  <BR>Denemaur had battled Nightmare, Dragonnaught, and Galin. When he was still evil, that is. <BR> <BR>A very petite Angel stood on the battlefield. All the corpses were gone. Resurrected by the  <BR>Goddess, or God, whichever. She turned and smiled at Roketh, &#34;Time to go, Guardian.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh stopped, slightly confused and asked, &#34;Will I be dead?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No, no, just immortal. you&#39;ve crafted your own legend now, and it will be spoken for years to  <BR>come.&#34; She smiled slightly. <BR> <BR>Roketh had a single tear in his eye as he waved to  his comrades, his allies, but more  <BR>importantly, his friends. Naturally, the less intelligent monsters wept up a storm, namely War  <BR>and Tiny. They all watched with an odd sense of regret and joy as a slight, white ring appeared  <BR>under Roketh. He and the Angel smiled as the ring started to emit a smoke, or mist of some kind.  <BR>They both began to sparkle a bit, like the godly figures they were. Roketh tossed his scythe to  <BR>Azurian, who watched dumbfounded, and yet still upset. They all had at least one ice tear fall  <BR>down their cheeks to the ground. Roketh&#39;s tear, largest by far, hit the ground harder than the rest.  <BR>In later years, where these tears fell, a massive forest appeared, with one mighty cyprus in the  <BR>center, and the barren wastes were no more. <BR> <BR>Many still believe that the Elements Legend was true, and that Roketh still holds a watchful eye  <BR>over this world. Now, he has a council of warriors, supposedly the strongest beings ever. Even  <BR>now he presides, though never getting directly involved, he more less watches over rather than  <BR>guide those of us who are still here. Even now, people believe it. <BR> <BR>Now, there is a statue on that mountain, overlooking the lush forest below. A Dragon, setting his  <BR>watchful gaze over his last creation. In the evening, when the sun is red as it falls, the light  <BR>strikes the statue just right, and it glows orange, just like the real beast. He holds his scythe  <BR>limply in his right hand, slightly turned, starring left, over his massive forest. Engraved in the  <BR>base is a simple epitaph, in remembrance. <BR> <BR>For our Champion, <BR>savior of all, <BR>this statue of you, <BR>will never fall. <BR> <BR>Indeed it never will. the finest craftsmen and the finest metals were put into it, so it may last  <BR>forever. <BR> <BR> <BR>-End CHB

 I&#39;m glad I got to see this.  For a while I thought I wouldn&#39;t come back.  Anyways great job CHB and congrates on doing as so many chapters.  I feel as if I might continue my story when I have the time, but I&#39;m having too much fun writing Sotsu.  Anyways great story, and I loved the ending.  Take care and c&#39;ya whenever! <BR> <BR>-Nicholas D. Wolfwood-

 Pretty <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> good.  Your writing has improved greatly since the story began.  When it started everything was rushed, but at some point it slowed down and was more like a real novel.

 That is the main reason i refuse to change any of it. Though I want to, it serves as a constant reminder of progression and maturaty. <BR> <BR>and thank you.

 I feel the exact same way about my story, CHB, regardless of how much I want to go back and fix my typos. ;&#41;

 CHB, you should write another story.  I&#39;m sure that many of the members would enjoy it.
