 There was a huge feast held in Dunnellon High School&#39;s cafeteria to celebrate the newly certified trainers and their first monsters.  Justin named his Icy Jell, Chill.  They sat at the table with Brandon &#40;with Brujah, his Joker&#41; and Laura &#40;with Meowzer, her Mew&#41;.  Chill had already engulfed his share of burgers and fries.  Brujah wasn&#39;t hungry and Meowzer only drank milk.  The principal, a wise man and master trainer, Tesca II had an announcement to make. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ladies and gentleman, congratulations for passing your breeding exams.  I look forward in seeing each and every one of you progress to the next level.  More advanced classes are available, but I have a feeling most of you would rather go out in the world and start your career as a champion rancher,&#34; he said.   <BR> <BR>Then, his eyes froze on a young man, rudely talking to his buddies during his announcement.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Excuse me sir, but can you quiet down,&#34; he said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why?  I already have enough to become a master, I don&#39;t need your nonsense,&#34; the student mocked. <BR> <BR>&#34;If you feel so confident, perhaps you&#39;d like to challenge me in a match,&#34; Tesca II replied. <BR> <BR>Everyone in the room gasped.  Even the Jokers and the Mocks turned serious.  Seeing Tesca II and his Orion in action was a wonderous sight indeed.  The kid accepted, dragging his Zuum away before it even finished its food.  The battle was held outside in the courtyard.  A referee announced the battle. <BR> <BR>&#34;The Trainers, Tesca II vs Javier.  The Monsters, Starshot the Orion vs Raptor the Zuum.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll let you make the first move,&#34; Tesca said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Gladly,&#34; Javier replied, &#34;Raptor, claw it up!&#34;  The Zuum looked up at the sky, then to the ground, confused.  &#34;What are you doing you <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>!&#34;  Javier shouted. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ha, your monster is not loyal.  Loyalty is very important.  Without it, you can&#39;t control your monster,&#34; Tesca II explained.  With that said, Starshot focused and lifted Raptor into the air with Telekinesis and swung it in circles, then, gently returned it to the ground.  The Zumm was fazed, but not hurt.  Javier had lost the match even before it started.
