 I&#39;m new at posting in the ficion area, so criticism is welcome. Just don&#39;t be to harsh. This story is based on MR4. I am Phayne. The story is probably the shortest in this area. <BR> <BR>               A Dangerous Mission <BR>     The night was dim, my assistant Rio just finished talking to my sacred tree. There was a soft rumbling to the back of my ranch, but I thought nothing of it. The next week, there was a huge cave opening out back! Rio was stunned. &#34;Phayne, look at the cave, How did this happen?&#34; Suddenly, an old dude stepped out and explained what the cave was and what he wanted us to do. &#34;Hello, whew, what a cave! This looks like a good spot to explore. Can you two check it out?&#34; We were kind of confused about the cave and old man, but we gladly accepted. &#34;Sure, we&#39;ll check it out.&#34; I said. My monsters, Rambo &#40;garu&#41; Rasqual &#40;Dino-Zuum&#43;?&#41; and Soluv &#40;Ant.Yellow&#41; were pretty good, so I thought this would be easy. -First floor- We were at the first floor, pretty easy. We defeated the monsters in 5 sec. -Second floor- Also very easy. Found some toy glasses, junk toys, and amethyist. -Third floor- It was harder. One monster we fought was a Joker, he attacked my monsters with slashes of his scythe. I yelled for my monsters to run, but they stayed firm, The joker came at them. Suddenly, Rambo lunged at the Joker, and started to bite him. The Joker smacked him away. But Rasqual tackled him before he could slash at Rambo. The Joker was knocked out. I thought, yes, my monsters are awesome. -Fourth floor- Fourth floor was great. I found a tablet. not much else. -Fifth floor- The last floor. we were just walking when we entered a mysterious room. It was darker than the other rooms that we have been in. Suddenly Rio saw something. It was huge! A King Shiden! It attacked us immidiatly. He punched Rasqual and instantly knocked him out. &#34;Noooooo. Rasqual!!!&#34; Rambo then attacked him with Fire charge. It took his health down by a fourth. I switched to Soluv. Soluv lunged at The huge bird. He used his legendary &#34;X-Blade twice. This instantly knocked him out. I thought; &#34;Wow, what a big Raiden. Rio talked to him, for a little while.We went back to the ranch, only to be ambushed by the same joker. He slashed at Rambo, slaying his soul in the process. he slayed Soluv as well. Having only Rasqual, I wept at my sacred tree.

 Yes, I know, my story sucked completly. I just read it over and even I thought it sucked. I think my other story, in the completed epics is better.
