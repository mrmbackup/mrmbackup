 Chapter 22:The Black Tower... <BR> <BR>At long last, it stood before them. The huge ebon spire of ancient metal rising high into the darkening sky. The monsters looked upon it with a sense of awe...and dread. For the Tower, it seemed, stared back at them...taunting, calling them forward to die in it&#39;s shadowy chambers. Like a great sentinel guarding the Master within, this black construct represented the final leg of this long journey. A journey that began as a simple quest for revenge, and while that thought still played on Justice&#39;s mind he also realized that it had become something greater. The world was at stake, for if the master didn&#39;t scorch the land with his deadly weapon the mysterious Zyoth would do the job. Incredibly...the worlds fate lay in the hands, and claws of this small group of monsters. <BR> <BR>Drawing closer still, an image appeared above the massive black doors. The symbol of the Master...the open Eye. However before anyone could attempt to pry the doors open Shielka stepped forward. The Daina clasped the symbol around her neck and held it up to the eye. The emblem blinked once and the doors opened. Inside it was almost totally dark, a few dim lights overhead providing barely enough to see by. Cautiously the group walked in...They now stood in a circular chamber, empty except for a huge depiction of the Master&#39;s symbol which was painted on the floor. Three dark corridors led out of this chamber, none had markings to tell where they would lead.... <BR> <BR>&#34;Old man...I don&#39;t like this.&#34;Stone Claw hissed quietly as he slid around the chamber, his eyes darting about.&#34;It was too easy gettin in here...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It seems this Master has no fear of assault...&#34;Moo snarled, &#34;I will show him fear....No one stands against Moo and lives.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I agree...this reeks of an ambush.&#34;Justice said, rubbing his fingers against the cold blade of his sword. He turned his gaze to the daina who was walking around the room, as if searching for something. He wasn&#39;t entirely sure he could trust her...&#34;Well, you know this place better then we shielka. What say you?&#34; <BR> <BR>The daina paused for a moment before speaking, at last sure she knew where they were...&#34;Alright...this place is very different in stationary mode but I think I&#39;ve got my bearings...Straight ahead leads to the Masters chamber. However, it&#39;s too heavily defended to just run down there, you&#39;ll be dead in seconds. First we have to shut down the internal defense systems to the left and even then, they&#39;ll only be down for a few minutes before going to backup power.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey, what about that big gun thats gonna fry the land!&#34;Ganthor said,&#34;We gotta take that out too. What if they fire before the Masters dead?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Alright...here&#39;s the plan.&#34;Justice said.&#34;Me, Claw and Moo will wait here. Shielka and Ganthor, take the left passage and deactivate the security. We&#39;ll make a run for it and hopefully bypass most before it reactivates.... As for the weapon, Celine, Beatdown...I leave that to you.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll get it done.&#34;Celine said as she took flight. The Dryad and the fairyhare quickly descended into the right passage...Justice watched shielka and Ganthor rush into the left corridor and wished them luck...now they needed only wait and spring forward when the defenses dropped. Moo tensed up, eagerly awaiting his confrontation with the master. Stone Claw, strangely enough, didn&#39;t seem his usual bloodthirsty self. The Trident continually glanced into the left passage with a look of great concern.... <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you alright Claw?&#34;Justice said, putting his steel gauntlet on his shoulder only for the Trident to pull away with a hiss...Moo looked down at them and almost laughed. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;d suggest you both stay focused. Unless you want to die here...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;  <BR>Shielka and Ganthor traversed the corridors, on route to their goal. To deactivate the internal defenses they&#39;d have to find the control room, the nerve center of the place. The path began to climb upward sharply, though it was easy to follow. The empty halls were quite errie as their footsteps were the only sound that could be heard, except for the occasional energy surges as the weapon prepared to fire. At least most of the minions were outside or had been destroyed in the battle with Moo&#39;s fortress. After a time the huge stronghorn beside her began to grow fidgety... <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey, this is gonna be an easy job right?&#34;Ganthor said as he stomped along, &#34;I mean we&#39;re just gonna flip a coupla switches and thats that right?&#34; <BR> <BR>Shielka looked up at the monster questioningly. &#34;Not really, the master may be nearly out of troops but the command center will be protected...what are you worried about? I&#39;d think you&#39;d be able to handle any enemy that comes at us, your big enough...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s just that...I don&#39;t always got the will, ya know?&#34;Ganthor said, glancing almost nervously through the silent corridors...&#34;Don&#39;t matter how big ya are. If ya don&#39;t got the will, how can you attack?&#34; <BR> <BR>The daina stopped in her tracks and turned to the stronghorn with a look of annoyance..&#34;So what your telling me is...your pretty much useless? Come on, how difficult is it to just ball up your fist and hit something really hard?&#34; She began walking again, at an even faster pace this time.... <BR> <BR>&#34;Hard enough...see it&#39;s like there&#39;s this little percent gauge an-&#34;He stopped speaking as Shielka raised her hand to silence him. Before them stood the smooth metal doors to the command center. Once again the Daina was forced to show her symbol to gain entry and the door opened.... <BR> <BR>Upon entering the duo found themselves on a sort of balcony overlooking the nerve center of the entire ship...An oval shaped chamber filled with monitors and systems, blinking lights and terminals. In the exact center of the great chamber stood the master computer in the shape of a large column. A single stair led down into the room from where they stood. The area seemed utterly abandoned, not a single living thing in sight. Shielka was shocked by this fact, knowing that the master would not leave this place undefended...had he indeed grown too overconfident? <BR> <BR>&#34;Welcome!&#34;A voice sounded loudly overhead, a voice the daina remembered... &#34;How nice of you to drop in...&#34;  At those words the balcony collapsed and the two monsters tumbled to the floor. Granthor hit first followed closely by Shielka... <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey! Who is that?? The master?&#34;Ganthor wondered aloud as he picked himself up.... <BR> <BR>&#34;No...just one of his henchmen.&#34;Shielka replied, bitterness in her voice. &#34;Show yourself Talus! You coward!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You see me now, hahahaha.&#34;Talus&#39;s voice laughed.&#34;Don&#39;t understand? I had myself integrated into the ship that I&#39;ve labored so long in rebuilding. This command center is my home, indeed my very body...Now prepare to die traitor.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dozens of sentry guns appeared from the floor, walls and ceiling and began to open fire on the pair. Ganthor ran for cover as Shielka took to the air, nimbly dodging the laser blasts coming from nearly every direction. She turned in mid-air, destroying three with a single flame attack only to find more guns training on her from above and another from below. She wondered where Ganthor was as the light of a mega-ray escaped her hand, destroying another gun. Two remaining opened fire, nearly hitting the Daina as the beams grased her arms and wings. Shielka responded, thrusting both palms forward, a crimson ray firing from each. With those destroyed she turned around only to find that Ganthor had returned and smashed the ground turrets. Of course Talus was less then pleased with this.... <BR> <BR>&#34;No! No! No! Do you have any idea how long it took me to install those!?&#34; Talus screamed as loud as his audio would allow...&#34;Your just like the rest of them! No one appreciates my hard work....Fine, you want to play rough? I can play your game! Take this...&#34; <BR> <BR>Without warning metallic cables lashed out of the walls and floor compartments, ensnaring both monsters. The cables wrapped around their limbs with frightening speed and were powerful enough to keep even Ganthor entangled. As they struggled against the binds small machines equipped with deadly buzzsaws emerged from the ceiling and sped towards them. Shielka strained against her bonds but found it useless, she couldn&#39;t even reach her symbol to activate her master attack. But as the flesh shearing machines drew closer Ganthor lunged forward, ripping the cables right out of the wall and backhanding the small robots. The cables holding shielka released her in an attempt to regain control over the stronghorn. That turned into a critical mistake as Shielka blasted the surrounding consoles with fire and energy. <BR> <BR>&#34;Stop that! It took me years to rebuild those!!&#34;Talus screamed in rage as the cables pulled back...&#34;I thought you at least understood....&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I did, up until you betrayed me!&#34;Shielka yelled back, the fire of anger and hatred in her eyes...&#34;You were willing to watch me die. Just because you were to much of a coward to say something on my behalf!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes and I don&#39;t regret it ether!&#34;Talus responded as a hidden chamber revealed itself from behind the daina, the wall splitting apart.&#34;For the Master should have killed you the moment you appeared on our doorstep years ago...Now, it ends....&#34; <BR> <BR>A huge metal arm reached out from the shadows of the newly revealed chamber and grabbed Shielka before she could escape. Ganthor rushed forward but stopped in fear as a thing he&#39;d never seen emerged from the darkness...It was Talus himself, in a new form. His body was slightly larger then Ganthor&#39;s and covered with thick ebony platting. It had four arms, the bottom two were gattling guns while the upper right was a laser. The remaining limb formed a hand which held Shielka tightly. Cables and wires sprung from it&#39;s back, connecting it to the ship always. The head was the same, greatly disproportioned now but it was Talus&#39;s orginal head....Ganthor tried to attack but stopped once again as Talus trained his guns on him... <BR> <BR>&#34;Halt, remain still or be destroyed.&#34;Talus said in an amused voice.&#34;Yes, you see that it is futile to resist....now watch as I crush the life from this miserable insect!!&#34; Shielka screamed as he tightened his grip, but only for a moment as her lungs were allowed no room to take another breath. She gasped for air, clawing at his mechanical hands in vain. The daina felt her chest tighten, her lungs ached, her vision narrowed...She looked up at Ganthor with pleading eyes, as if asking him to escape while he could... <BR> <BR>&#34;Let her go!&#34;Ganthor roared as he charged forward, Talus let loose his gattling guns and arm laser but the stronghorns shell weathered the hail of bullets and heat. With a single punch Talus was send backward, smashing into several terminals. Shielka was released from his grasp and lay on the floor gasping for breath. Ganthor rocked Talus with one mighty blow after another, finishing with a devastating uppercut that took his head clean off...However the body still functioned... <BR> <BR>&#34;Ganthor....&#34;Shielka said as she stood up, her left hand holding her side as she probably had fractured ribs...&#34;Thank you....but let me finish this. Get out of the chamber.....&#34; Ganthor looked at her questioningly but obeyed, climbing back up to the door and making his way through. After he&#39;d gone Shielka turned her gaze to Talus, gripping her symbol.... <BR> <BR>&#34;Dark Fyre!!&#34;She called and her body erupted into pure flame. Talus opened fire and his attacks passed through her flaming form harmlessly. Suddenly more fire erupted from the floor and began to swirl around her, incinerating everything in it&#39;s path...Talus backed away in fear as he realized there was no escape...Columns of flame filled the entire chamber as the stench of burnt electronics clouded the air. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m sorry! Shielka I was wrong! We can be friends again! Yeah, thats it...what do you say? Friends???&#34;Talus said in a pathetic attempt to save his metalic hide...Shielka&#39;s response was simple and direct... <BR> <BR>&#34;Omega flare!&#34;Was the last thing his receptors picked up before Talus&#39;s body was swiftly incinerated. The entire chamber exploded into a sea of cleansing fire. The flame devoured all within seconds, plunging the hallway that Ganthor waited in into utter darkness...A few minutes passed...He waited but the daina did not return. The lights had been snuffed out by the command centers destruction and it would be a few more minutes before they returned....Finally he spotted a small shape approaching. <BR> <BR>&#34;Shielka!?&#34;He spoke and a moment later found that it was indeed her. &#34;Hey, I thought you was done for, ya know?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Aside from a serious head ache...I&#39;m ok.&#34;She said, leaning against the wall to rest. &#34;It&#39;s up to the others now.....I hope he&#39;ll be alright......&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Who?&#34;Ganthor asked inquisitively but got no response. He shrugged and sat down, awaiting the return of the lights....
