 Note:To anyone who&#39;s read this before. Chapter five is the same, minus a few errors. Chapter 6 however has been edited alittle and a new fight scene added. I hope you enjoy my improvements. <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter 5:Forest of the Dryads  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Hurry up you two.&#34;Said Justice, tapping his sword impatiently on his armored shoulder. On the journey towards the north the trio happened upon a sparkling river that flowed from the forest. His two companions, Stone claw and beatdown insisted on sampling it&#39;s waters. It had grown hot again this day, the afternoon sun glinting strongly off the durahan&#39;s metalic body. So strongly in fact that a traveler might be blinded by the reflecting rays. At last the two monsters had there fill.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;It&#39;s good,&#34;Beatdown said&#34;The best water I&#39;ve ever tasted. Wonder where it comes from....&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;The forest,&#34;Claw said, impaling a fish with his talons and gulping it down whole.&#34;Any idiot could see that.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t start argueing again,&#34;Justice commanded&#34;We must go on, we&#39;re far enough behind as it is.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>It wasn&#39;t long before they came to the outskirts of the forest. The main road had branched off, a dirt path went northwest and continued into the forest. Justice went first, stepping into the shadowy woods. Suddenly he felt a great weight upon him. It forced the durahan to one knee. There was nothing visable pushing him, but something was there, exerting great force from above. Justice, using all his considerable strength fought against the invisable force. Standing erect once again the weight lifted.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Whats wrong? Beatdown asked.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34;Justice replied&#34;Something clearly does not want us here....But I must keep going, if our enemies passed through here then so must we.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>The forest was a strange place indeed. The air was thick and oppressive, the heat was stifling. It was dark except for a few golden rays of sunlight flitering down through the canopy. No sound was heard, not even a single solitary bird singing in the treetops. Yet the forest was teeming with life, they couldn&#39;t hear it, but rather they felt it. Countless times justice would stop and turned to a disturbance in the unnaturally still forest. The slight russle of a plant, a shade darting from one tree to the other. At one point a twig snaped, justice turned and raised his sword to it&#39;s origin. A minute passed, then two, nothing revealed itself amongst the countless trees. Claw suggested it was nothing and they moved on.  <BR>	 <BR>Time passed and nearly three hours later the trio were still wandering. Justice himself was begining to despise this place, unable to shake the feeling they were being followed. Every living tree seemed to watch them, well aware of the intruders in the forest. One had to wonder if they were mocks despite their sheer size. Every tree was huge, some truely ancient ones measuring several meters across and climbed hundreds of feet. Following the beaten path was difficult as thick plantlife had grown over some sections. What made this so unusual was that this only occured in places where the road made a shape turn. Then, a shadow darted passed them through the foliage moving to quickly to tell just what it was.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I knew it,&#34;The durahan clutched his blade.&#34;Whoever you are! Show yourself!&#34;His voice seemed to echo through the forest. No other sound could be heard.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Why&#39;d you stop? Whats wrong?&#34;Claw asked&#34;I didn&#39;t see anything.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I saw something!&#34;The fairy hare wispered&#34;It ducked into those trees. Lets go over there and check it out.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Your both crazy! Just a few animals, most forests have them.&#34;Said Stone claw before turning away, beatdown jumped in front of him.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I&#39;ve had enough of you!&#34;She said putting up her fists.&#34;I can take you! Come on! Bring it!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Hahaha, you&#39;ve got guts at least, or are you just really stupid?&#34;Claw laughed&#34;Don&#39;t you know I eat hares for breakfast, litterally.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Shut up, both of you!!&#34;The voice of Justice rose above their arguement.  <BR>	 <BR>At that moment the forest began to tremble, they watched as several of the surrounding trees revealed themselves as wood golems. The wicked looking creatures held their sadistic grins as they surrounded the trio. They closed in, tightening the circle, cutting off all escape. Justice searched for a way out. Fighting was his first instinct but that plan was quickly dashed as legion upon legion of golems appeared from the woods. However he noticed only one of them stood on the path.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Attack that one!&#34;Justice pointed his sword at the target golem. Beatdown nailed the wood golem with a highkick that knocked the bark off it&#39;s massive trunk. Stone claw tore into it with his talons, finally Justice ran forward and sliced the beast down the center. It split in two and, still smiling, fell dead. The three of them sprinted over his corpse and escaped. The other wooden golems pursued but moved about as slowly as moss grows on a log.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Nice work old man!&#34;Claw said from the rear of the group. Justice nodded but soon spoted their next problem. A dense fog was rising from the forest floor seemingly out of nowhere. Within a few moments it had completly engulfed them and nothing else could be seen with the exception of the grey fog.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Stay together!&#34;Justice said&#34;Stay close or we&#39;ll get seperated!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Damn, I can&#39;t see anything!&#34;Claw asked as justice lost sight of him.&#34; I can&#39;t s-.....&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Claw? Claw!?&#34;The durahan searched the fog but could see nothing. The trident didn&#39;t respond.&#34;Beatdown? Where are they?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Suddenly a bright light pierced the fog and hit him square in the chest. The attack made him staggered but he did not fall to the mega ray. Before he could act a surge of flame reached out from the fog to reduce his steel body ashes. Justice raised his shield, realizing he was facing some breed of pixie. He pushed on, walking straight to the source of the fire as the crimson flames licked his armor. Ignoring the pain he kept the shield outstretched, protecting his head and torso. At last he&#39;d escaped the fog and found himself face to face with a Dryad who was shocked by the power of the durahan. Before she could launch anouther attack he grabbed her wrists.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Why are you attacking us?? Where are the others??&#34;He screamed not noticing anouther dryad behind him. Justice was blasted from behind and knew no more...  <BR>	 <BR>Justice awoke later in an iron barred cell. Striped of his weapons he wondered what had happened, his entire body hurt. Stone claw and beatdown were also nearby, each in cells according to their respective sizes. The place they were in looked like a storeroom. It&#39;s gold colored walls held a great many crates and boxes. Ample sunlight came in through the open window. Then he noticed Claw acting rather strangly, the trident was curled up and shaking violently.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Claw? You alright?&#34;He asked, the trident didn&#39;t respond. He only continued to tremble, making pathetic wimpering noises. Justice could only sumise claw couldn&#39;t stand being caged again and was currently breaking down, he had to figure a way out of this. A moment later a Dryad guard came into to check on them.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;It almost time,&#34;She smiled&#34;For your execution. Of course the followers of Moo deserve no less.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Do I look evil to you!?&#34;Beatdown yelled&#34;Let us go! We haven&#39;t done anything wrong.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Whatever,&#34;The dryad paid her no heed&#34;Trying to lie your way out won&#39;t work with us.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Please...,&#34;Claw wimpered like a small frightened child&#34;I can&#39;t be like this, let me go...mercy....mercy...&#34; The Dryad looked truely sorry for him at the moment and came alittle closer. She was about to speak when the Tridents claw shot out from behind the bars and wrapped his talons around her neck.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I can&#39;t believe you fell for that!&#34;Claw darkly, tightening his visegrip &#34;How dare you cage me! Think you can attack me from behind and live?&#34; The dryad struggled for her life.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Let go claw!&#34;Justice called out to him but claw only tightened his grip, a crazed look in the tridents eyes. The dryad stopped struggling and her body went limp but still claw held on. It looked as though he would&#39;nt stop until she was dead.&#34;Damn it claw! Let go!!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>He did and the dryad collasped to the floor, unconscious but still alive and breathing. Claw then smashed his way free and tore the cell apart in his raged before doing the same of Justice. Just as he&#39;d torn the roof off beatdown&#39;s cage yet anouther dryad walked in, through the open door they could see several wood golems waiting outside.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;We have this place surrounded,&#34;She said&#34;There is no escape agents of moo.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;For the last time...&#34;Justice said&#34;We are not agents of moo! Notice we don&#39;t bear his symbol. We were only looking for a way through the forest.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;That is for our leader to decide, explain yourselves to him.&#34;She said, before glancing at the fallen guard&#34;But if it was up to me you&#39;d be killed on the spot for harming one of us.&#34;Two more dryads swept in to aid the injured one.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;We will come quietly,&#34;Justice said&#34;I shall speak to your leader myself and convice him.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>The trio followed the dryad outside and were surrounded by a dozen wood golem escorts. Here, just had his first look at the city. Built in a huge clearing in the heart of the forest, it&#39;s golden spires were like nothing he&#39;d ever seen. The highest of these towers reached up toward the heavens, just shy of the tallest trees. The city was littered with trees and parks, a bubbling natural spring had been converted into a large ivory colored fountain. It&#39;s crystal waters were channeled throughout the city in a series of small streams. In the cities heart stood an immense structure that reminded justice of a thick tree trunk for some reason. Six woodknights protected this place and a statue of a mock stood in the in a small garden. They were led inside, the wood knights as there escorts. The hallway was overgrown with plants and flowers, the walls covered with a thick layer of vines. The sound of running water could be heard below. Futher down the hall they came to a large room, the floor cover with water, it had a narrow raised section to walk on. At the summit of several stair was a white mock. He was very old, his narled bark more grey then white now. However he still had the same sadistic grin of all mocks.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I am white birch,&#34;The mock said&#34;I already know what your going to say. That you merely wanted a way through the forest, but explain to me why you killed one of my golems and attacked a dryad?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;But we were attacked first!&#34;Beatdown protested.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Silence!&#34;White birch thundered&#34;You are agents of moo sent to spy on us.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;No, not only do we not serve moo,&#34;Justice began&#34;But we have encontered and battled his forces twice now. I know you only want to protect this place, it&#39;s worth protecting indeed. But let us prove ourselves at least.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;And what if your request was refused?&#34;White birch chuckled under his breath.&#34;What will you do then?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Then I will fight my way out of here if I must!&#34;Said Justice&#34;For we have been delayed here far to long already. I would rather not raise my hand against those who oppose moo, but I must avenge my master. You may well kill me and my comrades in the end but I promise you white birch, your own losses will be great.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>The mock thought for a moment before a panicked woodknight rusehed in screaming.&#34;Moo&#39;s forces are outside the city, looks like there waiting for nightfall to attack.&#34;A few seconds later anouther dryad arrived, she looked alittle older then the ones they seen thus far, slightly taller and with longer hair.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Ah Celine, perfect timing.&#34;White birch said&#34;You say your not one of moo&#39;s warriors then prove it. Kill those who threaten this city, do so and I may believe you and only then will your weapons be returned. This dryad will accompany you, she is my strongest. Celine, don&#39;t hesitate to incinerate them if they get out of hand.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Ha! I&#39;d like to see you try.&#34;Claw said and celine shot him a cold stare. Exiting the building they followed the her through the city. The activity level of the place was high, wood golems were in the process of building stone walls around the area. Watch towers had already been construted with dryads working lookout. Woodknights were performing training manuevers in the square.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;What does moo want here?&#34;Justice asked thier dryad escort.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Since when does moo need an excuse to destroy anything.&#34;Celine relied.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;You seem to be protecting something other then your lives,&#34;The durahan pointed east to a building that was being totally sealed up.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;That none of your concern...&#34;Celine said but then added&#34;...When I&#39;m sure I can trust you, you&#39;ll know more.&#34; They left the city and headed into the forest once again, following the woodknight who&#39;d first brought news of moo. They went deeper in, the city quickly disappearing behind the trees. The sun was just begining to set at this time. Ten minutes later a group of Gaboos jumped out of the surrounding bushes, each with the symbol of moo. Justice attack barefisted, but the moment his steel gauntlet connected with the gaboo it vanished. Then they all did so. A moment later the woodknight returned.&#34;Hey! Over here.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;They followed him to a small clearing and found the gaboo. They were dead, each one horribliy mutilated. Some had been splattered all over the trees. The others were only an illusion, question was who killed them? Suddenly an explosion came from the direction of the city that rocked the forest. They took off toward the city, the faint sounds of battle raging on. Half way they found an injured dryad nearly dead on the ground. 	 <BR>	 <BR>&#34;We are...under attack,&#34;She said weakly. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Who did this??&#34;Celine asked.&#34;Moo.&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;No.......&#34;The dryad said with her dieing breaths&#34;Someone else.... <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter 6:The Warriors of the Master  <BR> <BR>&#34;My god...&#34;Justice said as he and the others stood on the edge of the forest, the desimated city before them. The wall meant to ward of invaders had crumbled. The shining gold towers shined no longer and toppled to the earth. The gardens burned, homes were reduced to dust. The great fountain, once the centerpiece of the city, stood in utter ruin. The home of white birch had not been spared, destroyed by a massive explosion. A fire now raged throughout the city. The flame seemed alive, burning through solid stone with ease and constantly seeking something else to devour. The monsters who once populated the city had all been slain. Many were burned to death, still others had been hacked to pieces. In a matter of minutes that which took so many years to build had been obliterated.  <BR> <BR>Justice shook his head disbelievingly, wondering how all this could happen so quickly. He looked to celine who&#39;d turned ghostly pale, tears rolling down her cheek she watched helplessly as her home burned. It was totally silent now, except for the crackling of the many fires. Who or whatever had attacked seemed to have gone. Beatdown walked over to a fallen woodknight and gave a slight nudge. His head silently rolled away, now nothing more then a poor suit of armor.  <BR> <BR>The durahan approached the fountain which had been totally destroyed. He droped his gaze and looked down at his reflection in the still water. His stare was answered by a pair of cold eyes, eyes he remembered. Then the fountain erupted as a large aqua cutter surfaced and attempted to stab justice. The durahan fell back, barely avoiding the deadly attack. The Cutter laughed, water casscading off his transparent body. He bore the crest of the eye.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Liqua...&#34;Justice said remembering the night of his trainers death and feeling his hatred for the cutter anew. At last the chase was over, his prey had come to him. But in his lust for vengence he&#39;d forgoten he was unarmed. He was quickly struck down by liqua who then laughed again at his failure. The cutter then desended upon the fallen knight, egar to rend him limb from limb. This never came to pass as liqua was struck by an enegy shot followed by a mega ray. He fell backward, splashing into the fountain.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I will finish him off!&#34;Cried the woodknight who lead them into the forest to battle moo.&#34;For revenge!&#34; The knight leaped into the air and pointed his blade downward before desending on the aqua cutter. Suddenly there was a flash of light, a ball of energy struck him before he could impale the cutter and exploded, killing him. As the dead woodknights charred form fell to the earth a wicked laughter could be heard. It sounded very much like a joker, but the voice was a womens. She appeared a moment later, seemingly out of thin air. A Lilim, the dreaded cross between a pixie and a joker, she desended and landed next to liqua. She too wore the symbol of the eye. Before anyone could attack this new threat she was joined by yet anouther. The lorica Vor appeared, taking a quick glance at justice and his companions.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Are these the ones who&#39;ve been following you?&#34;The lilim asked Vor. The lorica nodded silently.  <BR> <BR>&#34;So, your all together.&#34;Claw hissed,&#34;Just who the hell are you guys anyway?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;We are the warriors of the Master,&#34;Vor said, with great dignity and pride, relishing the words as he spoke.&#34;We serve him in all things. We give action to his thought, meaning to his word. We strike down any who would oppose him. We are the living extensions of his will! And when the Master takes this world, we will enforce his law.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Who&#39;s the master??&#34;Beatdown wondered.  <BR> <BR>&#34;You will know him soon enough,&#34;The lilim said&#34;And so the entire world will know the Master as well. Hahahahahahaha!&#34;Her laugh was truely horrible, worse then a jokers, like the tormented crys of a thousand tortured souls.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Shut up!&#34;Celine ran forward, her depression boiled over into rage.&#34;I don&#39;t care who you are or who you serve! I&#39;ll kill you for what you did to my city, my home.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;My city, my home.&#34;Vor mocked and his comrades laughed,&#34;You pathetic tree coddler! You will be the first to sample my steel!&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Leave her out of this!&#34;Justice pushed celine aside&#34;Your battle is with me. I&#39;ll kill you with my own hands if I must!!&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Calm down old timer,&#34;Vor said&#34;I&#39;d like to kill you myself today, I really would. But I have to aid my fellow warriors with our prize.&#34; He turned his back and justice became enraged. He charged Vor from behind, but the lorica heard him coming. Vor turned and slashed justice across the chest leaving a deep scar in his armor.&#34;Take that wound as a gift from me. To add to your shame of failing to protect your own trainer! Suffer this in your last moments of life! Liqua! Jakira! Kill these dogs in the Masters name!&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;As you wish,&#34;Jakira said&#34;I&#39;m so glad he made it a direct order. I do love mixing business with pleasure.&#34; The lilim flew into the sky and began raining bolts of energy upon the burning city. The four monsters were forced to take cover amongst the ruins. Justice wanted to wait until she tired, until she had not the will to continue the relentless bombardment. That never happened and Jakira continued to turn the already destroyed city into a large crater.  <BR> <BR>&#34;This is pointless!&#34;Celine said stareing hatefully at the lilim.&#34;I&#39;m going up there, somebody has to shut that witch up.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Alright, becareful. I&#39;ll take care of liqua.&#34;Justice motioned to Claw and Beatdown&#34;Backme up.&#34;  <BR> <BR> <BR>Celine took to the air tossing a lightening bolt at Jakira to get her attention. The lilim laughed once again and responded with a bolt of her own. The dryad dodged the attack as the others ran to confront liqua. Celine looked up and gasped, several balls of energy were screeming toward her. Once again she barely avoided death as they sailed passed. They impacted with the ground behind her and the resulting explosion sent the dryad hurtling out of control. Celine beat her wings furiously, finally able to regain her balance. Dazed by the shock of the explosion, celine seemed an easy target and Jakira swooped in for the kill. However, though her vison was blured and her head ached celine could still hear the sound of that horrible laughter well enough. The dryad shot a mega ray at her enemy, jakira rolled in the air, the ray grazing her left arm. <BR> <BR>&#34;Damn it!&#34;The lilim screamed, holding her bleeding arm.&#34;Damn this hurts! You&#39;ll pay for that, with your very soul!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Whats the matter?&#34;Celine asked&#34;You can dish it out but you can&#39;t take it!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Is that corny line the best you can think of!?&#34;Jakira seemed to forget her pain and began to laugh.&#34;Allow me to demonstrate just how much I can dish out.&#34; <BR> <BR>With those words Jakira flew straight at Celine with such speed the dryad didn&#39;t have time to react. They collided, each abandoning all high powered techniqes for an old fashioned brual. What had begun as an battle of magic had disintergrated into an airal catfight. The lilim wrapped her hands around celine&#39;s neck and began to strangle her, claws sinking painfully into her flesh. As the life was being choaked from the dryads body she noticed they were both falling to the earth. A fall from this height would kill them both, but jakira held on, determined not to release her death grip. In a moment of desperation celine struck jakira in the stomach, forcing her enemy to release her. She then followed up with a bang attack, the blast sent jakira flying backward. As celine saved herself from impacting with the ground she looked for her opponent. Jakira was still alive, hovering over a cluster of burning trees. <BR> <BR>&#34;Your tougher then you look,&#34;Jakira said, she was breathing heavily but relatively unhurt.&#34;You&#39;d be a good ally....if you weren&#39;t so weak.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What do you mean weak!?&#34;Celine screamed and jakira proceeded to torch a nearby tree.&#34;No! Stop now!!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;See what I mean? Weak.&#34;The lilim laughed once more.&#34;Getting so emotional over a bunch of worthless plants. I can&#39;t stand you dryads.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Worthless huh?&#34;And as Celine spoke those words the forest responded. The trees below jakira trembled and they reached up, branches outstretched like fingers. They grabed the lilim, tightly binding jakira as celine looked on. She began to summon the power for a final blow and end this struggle. A golden ord of light began to grow in her palm.&#34;Now you&#39;ll pay for your crimes against my people!&#34; <BR> <BR>Suddenly Jakira burst free of the trees grasp and retaliated with flame. The evil fire began to devour the trees instantly, but still their branches came. A huge scythe materialized in the lilim&#39;s hands and with it she cut down the plants feeble atempts to capture her again. Seeing this, Celine wasted no time in throwing her orb of light, which might spell death for her nemesis. Jakira laughed and batted the orb away with a swing of her scythe. Celine was nearly hit with her own power, she dodged and the golden orb blasted into the scorched earth. But as she turned to face her enemy again celine found jakira hovering a mere six feet away. <BR> <BR>&#34;Lets see you dodge this!&#34;Jakira screamed&#34;Death energy!!&#34;  <BR> <BR> <BR>Justice made his way toward Liqua who was still in the fountain. The cutter was in an almost relaxed position.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I likes water,&#34;He said in a classic display of naga stupidity.&#34;You oppose master? Liqua will kill! You are lucky, Liqua will use Master attack!&#34;The aqua cutter put his hand on the symbol of the eye and it glowed deep blue.&#34;Aqua command!&#34; The spring behind him exploded, pillars of water surged to the surface and aimed at justice with errie accuracy. He tried to run, avoiding the first stream but was nailed by the second. The force push him into a section of wall still standing, his steel frame leaving a deep imprint. Anouther surge attempted to pulverize him but claw pulled the durahan to safety.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Gettin slow old man,&#34;He said with some concern&#34;Your not gonna let him do that to you are ya??&#34; Before justice could respond several balls of energy rained down from above. The two monster quickly took cover and the blasts left many deep craters in the ground. <BR> <BR>Justice pulled his battered form up.&#34;Attack! For Vengence!&#34; They charged, beatdown tried to attack with a her hand to hand combat moves. A wall of water errupted from the ground and knocked the fairy hare back. Claw came in with a deadly pierce but he too was hit with a powerful stream of H2O. Justice was about to attack head on as well but stopped, Liqua wasn&#39;t going to let them get close enough to even land a punch. Instead he pulled beatdown aside.&#34;I have an idea. Find my sword.&#34; She nodded and ran off to accomplish the task. Stone claw was still trying desperatly to get close enough to harm the cutter.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Claw? Think you can pull off a drill attack?&#34;Justice asked. Meanwhile Celine and Jakira continued to light up the sky with there battle.  <BR> <BR>&#34;You nuts?&#34;He panted&#34;I&#39;m exhausted, I&#39;ll need five minutes.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;We don&#39;t have that long....look out!&#34;Anouther blast of icy water came at them. They both avoided it.&#34;How is he doing that?? Could it be the crest?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Last time I checked the power to control water wasn&#39;t on the naga list of attacks.&#34;Claw said dodging anouther surge.&#34;Just use your air slash or something!&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;d need my sword...&#34;Justice said as beatdown appeared carrying his blade. She tossed it over to him and justice caught it, feeling whole once more.&#34;Now we&#39;re ready! Distract him while I kill that murdering freak!&#34; Beatdown and claw attacked once again and liqua, still in the fountain, turned his full attention on them. Meanwhile the ageing durahan used a trick he&#39;d learned during his many years in the tournaments. Summoning the power of lightening into his sword he took aim and hurled the blade at his target. But his target wasn&#39;t liqua, it was the fountain itself. The charged sword landed in the fountains waters, the liqua began to shake involentarily as he was eletricuted. Finally his chared body fell forward, unmoving.  <BR> <BR>Before he could check the body justice heard celine cry out in pain. He turned and saw her fall out of the sky, hitting the ground with a sickening thud. She didn&#39;t move as Jakira flew over to liqua who amazingly, still lived.  <BR> <BR>&#34;How dare you,&#34;She said&#34;You dare to strike a warrior of the master? This will not be forgotten durahan! You and your friends will die along with the rest of the masters enemies. We will not underestimate you again...&#34; Suddenly a building in the distance exploded. Justice realized it was the same one the dryads were guarding so heavily. A large dragon like creature appeared and took to the skys carrying a huge metalic object. A smaller figure followed close behind.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Ah, Shielka and Grapper have claimed the masters prize.&#34;Jakira said&#34;Until we meet again...&#34;The lilim weaved some sort of spell and the two disappeared before there eyes. Justice ran over to celine who was badly injured, bleeding from multiple cuts, and took her up in his arms.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Justice!&#34;Beatdown said&#34;White birch is still alive! He told me where to find your sword. He&#39;s hurt bad though, he doesn&#39;t have much time left...&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m going to get some answers,&#34;Justice said carefully giving the dryad to Claw.&#34;Hold her, be gentle.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Gentle?? I&#39;m a trident if you haven&#39;t noticed!&#34;Claw said&#34;Being gentles not in my blood.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Just don&#39;t hurt her anymore then she already is,&#34;Justice said and followed beatdown to whitebirch. He recovered his trusted shield along the way. They found the old mock in what was left of his house. He was nearly dead already and had begun to breath his last breaths.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Did you...stop them?&#34;He said painfully.  <BR> <BR>&#34;No, what is it they stole?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;A machine from the ancient times,&#34;The mock replied.&#34;It radiated a strange energy. I knew moo would want it so I had it locked up. I Didn&#39;t know of a way to destroy it safely....is celine alright?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Still alive for the moment,&#34;Justice said.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Take her with you, she is the last of this city.&#34;He said weakly,&#34;I am afraid to think of what those lunatics will do with what they stole.&#34; Justice looked up at the destroyed ceiling, night had fallen, and once again no stars shone in the sky. He didn&#39;t know what this &#39;Master&#39; intended...but he knew they&#39;ed find out soon enough.
