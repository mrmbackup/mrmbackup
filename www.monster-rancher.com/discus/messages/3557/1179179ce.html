 No offense man, but that was not so great. You need longer chapters. This was too short to be considered a short fiction. And when was moo a phoenix? wasnt he classified as a ???/dragon? oh well, it really doesn&#39;t matter. Nice try though. U did good good with the descriptions, but length is essential. Keep trying though.

 Double spaced like this is hard to follow. You don&#39;t really have an issue directly involved in your writing ability and word usage, but it seems that a plot or even a sink hook are lacking. <BR> <BR>I would ask you start with something more original, from your own mind. Know this, I look forward not to what you accomplish next, but what you continue to accomplish and evolve as you progress your ability more and more. <BR> <BR>Also realize, as long as you post, I shall read, and give what assistance and comments I can. Keep up the good work.

 I just noticed something I said in my comment about the first chapter. I told you to double space between paragraphs, not the whole thing. U c, fer some reason the board won&#39;t post a tabbed paragraph. So, we space each section of words to signify a paragraph. I&#39;m sorry if I confused you DM.
