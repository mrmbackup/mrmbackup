While searching my old floppy disks, I came across a few threads that started a lot of contraversy and imaginations to bloom &#40;These spawned the creations of Rys, Talon, fanfiction on this site as a whole, and even the MR poll of opinions category&#41;. It all started as something to do in the middle of the night, as a couple particular ranchers had gotten bored.  I DID edit pieces of it that were just innane chatter and insults.  Also, I was unable to obtain a copy of &#34;Creative Session 1,&#34; but it was 90% the exact same as Creative Session 2 &#34;Now Then! Time to really create! Let&#39;s GO people!&#34; Overall it&#39;s kept in full tact.  I hope everybody enjoys this playful trip back through time as much as I have. <BR> <BR> <BR>Now Then! Time to really create!

When the tornado dies away, the double is gone and the enemy has slash marks all over it.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll come up with more later. My carpal tunnel in my right arm is acting up, so I can only type w/ left, so I type slower. Gotta let it rest. Do more tomorrow. Laters!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>you know just reading the first 2 lines everybody could tell exactly who wrote this. I have an affection for eagles myself tigers and wolves are cool too but, never really got soo fascinated in them like you seem about lions.  <BR> <BR>-- tjmax &#40;<A HREF="mailto:tjmax@tnweb.com">tjmax@tnweb.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Hey, tjmax, can the sarcasm and CREATE!

LIVE WITH IT!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000. <BR> <BR>Sorry, tjmax. Hope that didn&#39;t seem too rude. Just reading my reply right now seems more mean than sarcastic, which is what I was going for. Sorry, ok? ^_^  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Ok, sounds fun! Here&#39;s my main breed/moves &#40;help me with cross- breeds&#41;: <BR> <BR>The monster is a VORTECH. He&#39;s an animal with the head of a mule and a broad, stocky body resembling a man. He&#39;s based on the main character from the comic book VORTECH:THE WONDER MULE, which I wrote and illustrated several years ago and still love. The main breed is grey-furred and green-eyed, with large hooves for feet, but human hands with three fingers. Character is fast and powerful, but willful and stubborn.  <BR> <BR>The moves:  <BR>Head Butt-self explanatory  <BR>Hard Charge-more forceful Head Butt-can be learned only after using Head Butt 25 or more times.  <BR>Yaw-Mule scream-saps guts.  <BR>Kick-self explanatory  <BR>Double Kick-He leaps in the air and delivers a two-footed slam  <BR>Thunder Combo-Uses a head-butt, punch and kick combo for S level damage!  <BR> <BR>Finally, a SUPER-SPECIAL MOVE: STUBBORN-takes 50 guts points-If used successfully any time BEFORE you get KO&#39;d, you will get back up with 100% life restored!  <BR> <BR>There you go, folks!!  <BR> <BR>-- Mike H. &#40;<A HREF="mailto:BlackPeke@webtv.net">BlackPeke@webtv.net</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Ghost - Demonic possession &#40;bad tech&#41;: Ghost takes control of opponent for a limited time. After this effect, the opponents guts will be reduced by 50-80.  <BR>Guts cost = 45  <BR>Probability = A  <BR>Withering = S&#43;  <BR>Sharpness = N/A  <BR> <BR>Phoenix - Rebirth &#40;good tech.&#41;:  <BR>Phoenix will regenerate its self when KO&#39;ed. It will be restored to full HP, but will lose 10-20 guts in the process.  <BR>Guts cost = 58  <BR>Recover = S&#43;  <BR>Probablility = S  <BR>Withering = N/A  <BR>Sharpness = N/A  <BR> <BR>Hade&#39;s Ashes - &#40;bad tech.&#41;:  <BR>Before being KO&#39;ed, Phoenix will scatter black embers at the opponent. These embers slowly burn at the opponent, and wither away 48 guts.  <BR>Guts cost = 35  <BR>Force = B  <BR>Probability = S  <BR>Withering = A  <BR>Sharpness = S&#43;  <BR> <BR>Nova Dive - &#40;no nature required&#41;:  <BR>The Phoenix species TRUE upgrade of Heat Beam! Phoenix flies into the air, and draws enegy from the sun. It then lets loose a massive display of gamma radiation upon the opponent.  <BR>Guts cost = 45  <BR>Force = S&#43;  <BR>Hit% = C  <BR>Withering = D  <BR>Sharpness = A  <BR> <BR>Wing Cutter - &#40;no nature required&#41;:  <BR>The Phoenix species upgrade from Rapid Beaks and Beak. Phoenix slashes the opponent with its wing, leaving a trail of flames on the body that is similar to the Centaur technique &#34;Cross Slash.&#34;  <BR>Guts cost = 28  <BR>Force = C  <BR>Hit% = A  <BR>Withering = B  <BR>Sharpness = D  <BR> <BR>Truthful Glare - &#40;good tech&#41;:  <BR>Phoenix eyes turn a bright neon green, and the opponent looses 45 guts and the chance to use attributes &#40;such as Grit, Power, Anger, etc.&#41;  <BR>Guts cost = 35  <BR>Force = N/A  <BR>Hit% = C  <BR>Withering = S  <BR>Sharpness = E  <BR> <BR>Beak Spear - &#40;no nature required&#41;:  <BR>Upgrade to Beak. Phoenix uses its speed to force its way through the opponent, using its Beak like a blunt object to burrow through.  <BR>Guts cost = 25  <BR>Force = A  <BR>Hit% = D  <BR>Withering = E  <BR>Sharpness = B  <BR> <BR>Ravaging Raptor - Super Combo:  <BR>Phoenix begins with Rapid Beaks, Talons, and Wing Cutter, moves to Nova Dive, and finishes the opponent with Beak Spear.  <BR>Guts cost = 99  <BR>Probability = A  <BR>Force = S&#43;  <BR>Hit% = B  <BR>Withering = A  <BR>Sharpness = S  <BR> <BR>Pixie - Mystic Barrier - &#40;no nature required&#41;:  <BR>All damage done to Pixie by intelligence attacks is reduced to 50%. Consqeuntly, all damage done to Pixie by power attacks is reduced by 1/3. This is a temporary effect.  <BR>Guts cost = 19  <BR>Probability = S  <BR> <BR>Pixie - Shield - &#40;good tech.&#41;:  <BR>Pixie is immune from damage for a short period of time. During this time, Pixie cannot generate guts, but is capable of using techniques.  <BR>Guts cost = 25  <BR>Probability = A  <BR> <BR>Pixie - Renewing Aura - &#40;good tech.&#41;  <BR>Upgrade from Shield. With this Pixie may generate guts, as well as attack. However, it lasts for a shorter period than Shield.  <BR>Guts cost = 38  <BR>Probability = S  <BR> <BR>Lightning Strike - &#40;bad tech.&#41;:  <BR>Pixie floats into the air, and is struck by lightning. This serves to regenerate partial HP, as well as increase the overall effectiveness of her electrical techniques.  <BR>Guts cost = 45  <BR>Probability = C  <BR>Recover = A  <BR> <BR>Electrocute - &#40;bad tech.&#41;:  <BR>Upgraded from Lightning Strike. Pixie gains less HP, but her electrical techniques all inflict the eveivalent of a 99 guts electrical technique of the same type.  <BR>Guts cost = 58  <BR>Probability = B  <BR>Force = S&#43;  <BR>Recover = C  <BR> <BR>Pointed tips - &#40;no nature required&#41;:  <BR>Upgrade from Slap. Pixie headbutts her opponent with her sharp horns, then stabs them with her tail.  <BR> <BR>Spiritual Charge - &#40;no nature required&#41;:  <BR>Pixie breaks the speed of light, and produces a doppleganger of its self that charges the opponent, sucking 80 guts away and causing minor damage. All damage caused by intelligence attacks to Pixie, after Spirtual Charge, is reduced to 1/4.  <BR>Guts cost = 25  <BR>Force = C  <BR>Hit% = B  <BR>Withering = S&#43;  <BR>Sharpness = A  <BR> <BR>Minion&#39;s Disposition - Super Combo:  <BR>Pixie begins with Flame and Lightning, moves to Spiritual Charge and Bang, continues with Heel Raid and Pointed Tips, and finshes the opponent off with Electrocute &#40;if bad natured&#41; or Renewing Aura, Spiritual Charge, and GigaRay &#40;if good natured&#41;.  <BR>Guts cost = 99  <BR>Probability = C  <BR>Force = S&#43;  <BR>Hit% = A  <BR>Withering = S&#43;  <BR>Sharpness = S  <BR> <BR>Joker - Paranoia - &#40;bad tech.&#41;:  <BR>Joker will swing his sythe, and the opponent will turn black. Guts will slowly be consumed, and probability of hit% is dramatically decreased &#40;-75%&#41;. Once paranoid, the opponent may use bad techs. that are the equivalent to the ones that it had, until the battle is complete.  <BR>Guts cost = 55  <BR>Probability = S&#43;  <BR>Force = E  <BR>Withering = S  <BR>Sharpness = D  <BR> <BR>Death Harvest - Super Combo:  <BR>Joker will start with Death Energy, move to Death Cutter, strike with Paranoia, and Finsh with Death Slash.  <BR>Guts cost = 80  <BR>Probability = C  <BR>Force = S&#43;  <BR>Hit% = B  <BR>Withering = S&#43;  <BR>Sharpness = C  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s all that I have time for, at this time. If you like these then I&#39;ll post more later. I&#39;m looking for opinions.  <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>To Eagle and Mike: Great ideas! Keep &#39;em coming. And the rest of you, c&#39;mon! Once you get into it, it&#39;s entertaining to see what you can come up with. And to Eagle &amp; Mike again: You two have great imaginations. Hope you two are in some sort of Creative Writing classes at school, because you can come up with great ideas. Mike, I&#39;ll try to come up with sub-types later. And try to come up with card descriptions like I did, although my card descriptions aren&#39;t that great, give your characters some depth! I&#39;m looking forward to what you two and everyone else comes up with! Laters!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s pretty cool. A friend and I created a new monster type as well: Spidron. Spidron is pretty much an oversized spider with a dull violet coat. We figured it would specialize in Speed, Skill and Defense, but not do well in Power and Life. The simplicity of its design make it easy to design crossbreeds too.  <BR>Spidron &#40;Spidron/Spidron&#41;- Although it is creepy looking, it earns its keep well.  <BR> <BR>Pink Widow &#40;Spidron/Pixie&#41;- Male breeders often have difficulty with this creature&#39;s appetite.  <BR> <BR>Speetle &#40;Spidron/Beaclon&#41;- Some people&#39;s urge to smash this one is overwhelming.  <BR> <BR>War Spidron &#40;Spidron/Durahan&#41;- Prefers to go find its prey instead of waiting patiently.  <BR> <BR>Spidrolith &#40;Spidron/Monol&#41;- The webs it creates are near indestructible.  <BR> <BR>Wolf Spidron &#40;Spidron/Tiger&#41;- Its gentle, protective attitude make it a good pet for children.  <BR> <BR>Spiker &#40;Spidron/Joker&#41;- Death comes quickly to those who invade its web.  <BR> <BR>Eyedron &#40;Spidron/Suezo&#41;- It&#39;s 8 eyes never lose sight of its target once they are locked.  <BR> <BR>Arachner &#40;Spidron/Metalner&#41;- Plenty of horror movies have featured this fearsome guy.  <BR>Crab Spidron &#40;Spidron/Arrow Head&#41;- Tacticians have long sought after this creature&#39;s impervious shell.  <BR> <BR>Tuxedron &#40;Spidron/Wracky&#41;- Many find this creature comical and keep it for amusement.  <BR> <BR>Spigon &#40;Spidron/Dragon&#41;- Cooks its prey over a slow flame before devouring it.  <BR> <BR>Rock Spidron &#40;Spidron/Golem&#41;- Bravery allows this monster to tackle even the largest foes.  <BR> <BR>Serpent Spidron &#40;Spidron/Naga&#41;- It&#39;s venom is often used to coat the tips of arrows.  <BR> <BR>Wood Spidron &#40;Spidron/Mock&#41;- This one blends in so well it never needs to build a web.  <BR> <BR>Natural &#40;Spidron/Plant&#41;- Although it lives longer than most Spidrons, it is considered weak.  <BR> <BR>Discodron &#40;Spidron/???&#41;- With its many legs and quick speed, it&#39;s a wonder on the dance floor.  <BR> <BR>Phobia &#40;Spidron/???&#41;- The bizarre markings on its abdomen give many reason to fear it.  <BR>Well those are all we came up with, but you should get the idea.  <BR> <BR>We had several other breeds with Spidron subs as well, like the Succubus&#40;Pixie/Spidron&#41; which has extra arms and fangs and the Venom Head &#40;Arrow Head/Spidron&#41; which has a big abdomen instead of a tail. You get the picture. What do you all think?  <BR> <BR>-- RoccoGibraltar &#40;<A HREF="mailto:crash_landon@hotmail.com">crash_landon@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>This is most interesting. Just to make this thread longer.... New Monster: Myn Myn&#40;myn/myn&#41;: Believed to be in some way related to the pixies, but more masculine, taller, and wingless. Nomad&#40;myn/tiger&#41;: This monster lkives in cold, arctic climates where it hunts a pack of reindeer. Pansy &#40;myn/plant&#41;: This monster is quite courageous despite its name. Neanderthal&#40;myn/ape&#41;: This monster is beleived to have been a failed attempt at cloning man kind. Knight in Shining Armor &#40;myn/durahan&#41;: This monster was essential in the cavaly of the war. Sage &#40;myn/mock&#41;: This s perhaps among the most learned of monsters. Perhaps the moves at a later date?  <BR> <BR>-- BJones &#40;<A HREF="mailto:emmanuel_kant@hotmail.com">emmanuel_kant@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Dude! Those Rule! Here is just a list of mine:  <BR>Goliath Goliath/Goliath: A mighty monster with Heavy power, and lightning speed. Supersonic Goliath/Hengar: This monster can be very slow, but if it is outraged it will chase you for days.  <BR>Brawn Goliath/Golem This monster has the most power out of any monster, and could crush a mountain in one blow.  <BR> <BR>-- Bloodshed &#40;<A HREF="mailto:sswenson3@uswest.net">sswenson3@uswest.net</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I put a few in the last thing, but unlike Eagle Fierce, I won&#39;t copy and paste mine into this one as well. Anyway...  <BR> <BR>Harley- Monster that resembles a tricked-out motorcycle.  <BR> <BR>Harley/Harley: Believed to carry on the rebel soul of its deceased rider.  <BR> <BR>Headlight &#40;Harley/Suezo&#41;: Staring this one in the eye will leave you blinded.  <BR> <BR>Silver Steed &#40;Harley/Metalner&#41;: A levitating bike from the future.  <BR> <BR>Stone Rider &#40;Harley/Golem&#41;: A poorly-made statue of a motorcycle.  <BR> <BR>Hell&#39;s Angel &#40;Harley/Joker&#41;: Never listens to anyone.  <BR> <BR>Plunderer &#40;Harley/Leo&#41;: The ride of a ruthless poacher.  <BR>Moves:  <BR> <BR>Rush/Basic/Power-Based: Shoots forward for a direct strike.  <BR> <BR>Pop-Up/Basic/Power-Based: Pops a wheelie and brings it down on an opponent.  <BR> <BR>Wheelie Saw/Sharp/Power-Based: Developed from Pop-Up: Revs front wheel while striking opponent.  <BR> <BR>Buzzsaw/Sharp/Power-Based: Holds the Wheelie Saw against opponent longer.  <BR> <BR>Exhaust Blast/Withering/Intelligence-Based: Much like Hare&#39;s Gas  <BR> <BR>Circling/Withering/Int-Based: Psychs opponent out by running around and around them.  <BR> <BR>Stunt Flip/Heavy/Pow-Based: Shoots forward into the air while backflipping down on opponent.  <BR> <BR>Light Beam/Hit/Int-Based: Headlight shoots a damaging beam.  <BR> <BR>Fierce Light/Hit/Int-Based: Enhanced Light Beam.  <BR>Hmm....does anyone care about any more of my ideas?  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Very GOOD!

It would have very little defense or power, but HIGH speed, skill, and intelligence. It could also cocoon in the middle of a fight and regain life.  <BR> <BR>-- Bill Mick &#40;<A HREF="mailto:otterzero@hotmail.com">otterzero@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Well, here&#39;s my two cents... or maybe it&#39;s a buck and a quarter.  <BR>My monster is the Cowl. It wears a long robe that usually hides its face and arms. It&#39;s an intelligent creature, and it&#39;s good at defense, but it&#39;s not a very strong monster. It has a neutral nature and a slim body. Its standard color is blue-grey. Most of its moves are designed to distract the enemy from being able to hurt it, rather than to hurt its enemies.  <BR>Its subtypes:  <BR>Cowl - Cowl/Cowl: Some say it hides its face because it is shy.  <BR>Justice - Cowl/Durahan: Though it is blind, it can easily find the truth.  <BR>Humble - Cowl/Gali: It is very beautiful if you peek under its hood.  <BR>Sculpture - Cowl/Golem: Many wonder how a robe made of stone moves so freely.  <BR>Shiver - Cowl/Tiger: A chill eminates from within its hood.  <BR>Temper - Cowl/Dragon: When it shows its face, smart folk run.  <BR>Shrubbery - Cowl/Plant: Durahans use its cloth as a sign of prowess. &#40;Sorry... couldn&#39;t resist&#41;  <BR>Black Robes - Cowl/Monol: They were responsible for much death in the ancient war.  <BR>Flighty - Cowl/Pixie: A pixie put on these robes and couldn&#39;t take them off.  <BR>Stalker - Cowl/Wracky: Nobody knows what it&#39;s thinking, so it isn&#39;t trustworthy.  <BR>Ringo - Cowl/Beaclon: It likes to listen to drums.  <BR>Pride - Cowl/Leo: A fierce and noble magician.  <BR>Hurricane - Cowl/Undine: A small storm cloud follows it no matter where it goes.  <BR>Ripple - Cowl/Niton: Its robe is lined with seashells and starfish.  <BR>Hooves - Cowl/Centaur: You can see its feet, so people assume it has a body, too.  <BR>Playful - Cowl/Hare: It would rather play in the dirt than battle or work.  <BR>Samhain - Cowl/Joker: Once a year it takes off its robe and nobody recognizes it.  <BR>Tallow - Cowl/???: A ball of flame hovers over the head of this waxy monster.  <BR>Mirage - Cowl/???: It is invisible to anybody it doesn&#39;t want to see.  <BR>Moves:  <BR>Claw, Kick, Ray, a few other basics.  <BR>Engulf: Withering. Pulls opponent into its robes and gains a small amount of the guts they lose.  <BR>Vanish: Disappears for a moment, then appears beside its opponent and does damage. Like Suezo move &#39;Teleport.&#39;  <BR>Flipside: Its robe turns inside out for a short time, and any damage dealt to it heals it instead. It cannot attack in this mode.  <BR>Dream State: Hypnotizes its opponent for a short time. Like Ducken move &#39;Ducken Dance.&#39;  <BR>Darkness: Withering. Decreases opponents hit percent for a short time and does a small amount of damage.  <BR>Mirror: Becomes a duplicate of its opponent for a short time. Player can not control Cowl in this state. It mimics its opponents moves at the same time, so any damage done to Cowl is also done to its opponent.  <BR>That&#39;s about all I can think of now... It&#39;s 4:30 in the morning, so if this sucks, forgive me.
