 Galin stood beside Roketh and stared grimly into the darkness. The cloaked figure stood there, almost mockingly. He was quite confident indeed, and right to feel so. A small storm had moved in now, the whips of lightning rampaged across the sky. The lightning illuminated the beast&#39;s face. His smile was seen even without the lightning, bobbing eerily in the darkness. The grin was smeared with the blood of a thousand brave warriors, all of which were destroied by him. Roketh knew this. He knew he and Galin were strong, but could they possibly overcome this fiend? <BR> <BR>Roketh gazed at the shadowed form of Kingston. Roketh&#39;s head shifted slowly to his right. The head of Nightmare was facing away from him, his body not far away. He turned his head a bit more and gazed at the corpse of Dragonaught. Powerful and merciless monsters they were, but he had killed them. He then realized how many lives were being lost in this war. Jace and Vyger had both been destroied, and the other lord&#39;s who made the ultimate sacrifices. Denemaur, Bloodlust, and Azurian, all gone. They gave Roketh their power, their life force. He then glanced to his left, where Galin stood poised for combat. All four arms were up, all four hands in fists. His face was one of extreme hate and contempt. Roketh gazed into his eyes, curious about how he was raised. He then had horrible thoughts of the three of them being raised under the harsh hand of this cruel master. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ve...&#34;Galin said as he glanced over to Roketh, who looked back a little stunned. <BR> <BR>&#34;...yes? You can say it, you may not have a chance to shortly.&#34; Roketh said with a small grin.&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin stared at the ground before saying, &#34;I&#39;ve never known friendship, are we...&#34; He stopped and his eyes moved across the ground frantically. Almost as if he was searching for a place to center his eyes, as if he could not look him in the eyes. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes. If you wish, I&#39;d like to be your friend.&#34; Roketh said as he put his heavy hand on Galin&#39;s shoulder. <BR> <BR>Galin looked up and something very rare hapened. He smiled, but he wasn&#39;t killing anyone or harming anything. A new sensation came over him, he felt like never before, like his life was begining again. He then looked over at the powerful creature in the darkness, Roketh did the same.  <BR> <BR>Then, a gut-wrenching laugh errupted from the darkness. As he stepped out, Roketh was awe struck. Four arms, such as Galin. Some kind of armor was on him, yet he was so swift. Not to mention huge, Roketh was up to his chest. The dragon was human like in most aspects. His wings were like a cape as a soft wind lifted them slightly. The monster was huge, and Roketh felt an un-wolrdly power that seemed to errupt from this beast. As Roketh looked at Galin again, he saw his new ally shaking slightly. His hands were fists again, and his wings out stretched. His long head was vibrating and pulsing to a degree. <BR> <BR> <BR>Then, the dragon began to scream. A blue ball appeared in front of him. He put all four palms around the blueish ball, that seemed to pulse and turned at its own will. Small sparks began to skip off Galin&#39;s hands, and soon small streams of lightning blazed over his hands. Lightning shot out of each hand, electrocuting the ball, or charging it. Galin&#39;s eyes began to glow a light shade of blue. Small, whip-like beams came out of his sockets a short ways. They waved somewhat as his head moved. <BR> <BR>Roketh looked at Kingston. The giant dragon had a strange look on his face. One that seemed to mix awe and curiosity with fear. His son now had changed, simply because he made a friend? How could that be? The power seemed to surge about Galin, as the air seemed to distort around himself in a sphereical manner. Like a hot day, when you can see the heat coming off the road. Kingston took a step back, he was now sensing an un-believable power. Roketh was forced to step away, the heat was intense. It was like standing near a volcano, one that was about to errupt with the force and anger of a lonely and hurt soul. Kingston and Roketh sensed it, all of Galin&#39;s angers and fears were being condensed and materialized. Galin was purging himself of all those bad feelings and memories, and was attempting to bestow them upon his former master. <BR> <BR>Kingston took a step back as the ground seemed to rumble. Indeed, cracks ran forth from where Galin was charging. The ground cracked and peeled like an overripe fruit. Roketh wasn&#39;t sure if Galin could pull it off. Kingston regained his balance and stood erect. He seemed to think of himself as the most powerful being, and did not fear Galin now. What could he possibly muster up, he had already killed him once...almost. Roketh interfered with that one, and restored Glin after words. Now, Roketh had helped Galin to reach a new level of power. <BR> <BR>Galin&#39;s body began to sink into the ground, literally melting the ground under him. The rock disappeared as it came in contact with the light blue orb that surronded the dragon. <BR> <BR>Galin put all his hands behind the bal, still charging it. Each palm was put inward, forming a X with his hands, fingures out. His fingures then bent slightly, and now the orb was glowing brightly. Galin screamed as a mighty surge of energy left his palms, prepelling the sphere towards its target. Kingston raised one hand, palm forward. He shot one blast of yellow energy towards the ball. When they hit, the explosion was massive. Kingston found himself quite shocked to see the blue orb still hurteling towards him as it errupted from the dust cloud. Kingston raised boths hands and fired again, this time in a constant stream of energy. Galin shot a blast into the back of his orb as well. The two beast began pushing against each other&#39;s blast. Galin screamed horribly as more power shot from his hands, pushing into the orb. Kingston saw his yellow beam begin to shatter. Where it conected with the orb, it was reflected in all kinds of directions. The ball cut through his beam slowly but steadily. Kingston began pushing with all his might against it, but it came still. Kingston heard something and looked to his left. Roketh slapped up his hands. Kingston&#39;s beam now shot into the sky. As he glanced back down, Galin put all the force he could into his beam. The orb hit Kingston in the stomache. Kingston flew backwards, his beam faded, and a massive explosion rang forth. Roketh was close enough to be hurled away from the blast. Galin was thrown away, as well. The force of the blast ran up his beam and sent him flying. <BR> <BR>As the dust settled, Roketh and Galin found each other. They went over to the newly made crator and peered in. Kingston was laying there alright. Both of his bottom arms were wrapped around his gut. He was leened over, propping himself up on his top two arms. <BR> <BR>&#34;Master....give...me...strength...&#34; Kingston said as he fell on his back. His arms relaxed and his chest stopped rising. <BR> <BR>&#34;I can&#39;t believe it was you who killed him.&#34; Roketh said smiling, &#34;The other amazing thing was the entire battle was won in one shot. It is not over. That was too easy for the major villin.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Galin spoke confused, &#34;How is it odd that I killed him?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, according to legend...&#34; Roketh said slowly, &#34;I was to get all of the Eight Lord&#39;s powers and destroy the evil. I only have the power of three...&#34; He stopped for a while, then said, &#34;...and I didn&#39;t kill him.&#34; <BR> <BR>They stared at the corpse for a few more seconds before Galin said, &#34;What does that mean?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It means...&#34; Roketh said grimly, &#34;...it ain&#39;t over.&#34; <BR> <BR>As if these words were a chime, a giant whirl appeared in the storm clouds. Lightning rang out and tickled the earth in constant streams. Three bolts ran across the ground. One hit Dragonaught&#39;s corpse with a bang. However, there as no explosion. Roketh and Galin whatched as the body was lifted into the air, and carried over to Nightmare&#39;s corpse. Another bolt hit Nightmare&#39;s body and head, then they hovered as well. Both limp figures were carried over to the crator, were the last bolt hit Kingston. Kingston&#39;s body had one, large hole through it. The three bolts had become on huge one, its base being the portal like apperation in the swirling clouds. Then, a dark shape began to come down the bolt, slowly riding it down. What seemed like a demonic spirit of sorts floated into the body of Kingston. The two others then fell into Kingston. All three bodies began to spin. They seemed to wreslte as their limbs limply clobbered each other. When the spining stopped, there was one form. It had the combined attributes of all of the dragons, with a demonic trait added. Then, one major surge hit the body. Its eyes lit up a brillant red as it fell out of the sky and landed in front of Galin and Roketh. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am the eternal. You destroied my pawns, now I must do this myself.&#34; He stood and dwarfed both dragons. &#34;I am Kronock, fear me and flee before my wrath.&#34; <BR> <BR>The massive beast disappeared into thin air. Nothing was there. Galin looked at Roketh and, with a dry sense of humor, said, &#34;You had to say something didn&#39;t you?&#34;
