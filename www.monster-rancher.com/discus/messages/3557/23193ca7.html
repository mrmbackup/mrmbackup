 &#40;I&#39;m baaaaaaaack, now lets see if I still got it. To comemorate this, I made a special long chapter. Enjoy.&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;You can&#39;t possibly be serious.&#34; taunted Dragonaught. The mere sight of the weaker beings made him laugh. <BR> <BR>&#34;Lord...we have one chance.&#34; Azurian looked at the massive dragon, &#34;You must go and find the others.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll never flee. Your men are brave, or foolish. Either way, I fight to the end.&#34; Roketh said as he looked at Dragonaught, &#34;He killed my friend...and Nightmare killed two.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;As you wish, my lord.&#34; Azurian said as he turned to Jace, &#34;Did my followers treat you well?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Errmm....this really isn&#39;t a time for that.&#34; Jace said as he gripped the staff. <BR> <BR>Roketh watched as the three dragons got closer, and as Dragonaught snickered still more. He turned and saw all the Elves and their beasts. Then, Azurian darted towards Dragonaught. Dragonaught raised his right hand and launched an all out assault with all the weapons on that arm, which was quite a few. Gun fire, beam weapons, and missle fire riddled the demonic being, but still he charged. He spun his scythe around his body several times before attempting a shot at the Dragon. When he swung, a load clank was heard along with a bright light blinding all present. When Roketh regained his sight, he saw the immpossible. Azurian was holding his scythe, pushing down hard agaist something. When Roketh finally regained all of his sight, he saw what was blocking it. Dragonaught had his left arm over his head, pushing back against the massive scythe and the monster that was attempting to drive it in him. Azurian had the foothold for now. Dragonaught was forced to a knee. Then, his other knee opened, and a small missle shot out and nailed Azurian in the chest. Startled, he stumbled back more surprised than hurt. Dragonaught wasted no time capitolizing on this. From his kneeled position, he fired himself into Azurian&#39;s gut, causing him to bend over in shock and pain. The Dragon raised his head quickly, nailing Azurian in the jaw. Azurian stumbled back as blood ran down his chin. Dragonaught pounced way into the air, looking at the Demon. <BR> <BR>&#34;Time to die, fool&#34; Dragonaught said as he stared down on the Demon, &#34;OMEGA MAX!&#34; <BR> <BR>As he said this, every compartment on his body opened. Then, a griffen rider hit him in mid-air with a thunderbolt. Startled, he leened back. Unfortunatly, all his weapons still fired. Now, they were pointing towards the Elves. Missles and gun fire sliced through the griffens, and still more rained upon the beetle calvery. <BR> <BR>&#34;NO!&#34; Azurian said as he watched hundereds of the elves die, &#34;It was to be me! You monster!&#34; <BR> <BR>Azurian jumped into the air, knocking the startled Dragon out of the air. His metel frame hit the ground with a load thud. Azurian fell upon him with a vengence. The Dragon looked up and saw the beast falling upon him, he then raised both hands up towards the plummeting demon. He prepared to unload on him, but he wasn&#39;t fast enough. Azurian scythe crashed into his shoulder. Roketh thought it was over. However, when he looked again, he finally realized the power of this fiend. Azurian&#39;s scythe had indeed hit home, but that got him no where. He did not count on the dragon&#39;s armor to be enough to deflect his darkness scythe. The blade had hit on the shoulder, but made little more than a small scratch. Dragonaught punched Azurian in the stomache with both fists. Azurian let out a gasping sound as the air was knocked out of him. Dragonaught smiled as he spoke, &#34;....my turn.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, the sound of a sword being unsheathed rang in time with the sound of parting meat. Azurian flenched and atempted to scream, but this came out more of a gargle as blood began coming out of his mouth. Then, a load boom was heard and Azurian was sent flying accross the battlefield. He landed some thirty yards behind Roketh, near Jace. As Roketh looked at his fallen ally, he turned as if to take his shots at the beast. Dragonaught stood, one hand had a sizable, single barrel that was smoking. The other had four, long, silver talons coming off the back of his hand, each soaked in blood. As his blades retracted and his gun disappeared into his forearm, he grined at Roketh. His teeth were circular, always spinning. Like a mouth of can-openers, like a maw of death. <BR> <BR>&#34;Three down,&#34; He taunted, &#34;Four including you little, tri-headed friend.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh took one step towards Dragonaught, when he heard a sickening laugh. He turned only to catch a clawed foot in the mouth. He backflipped and landed on his feet. He turned and true terror grasped his heart. For it was non other than Nightmare who had laid in the attack. The other two were with him as well. <BR> <BR>&#34;Master....My lord...I failed you...&#34; Azurian&#39;s voice mumbled. Roketh ran to his fallen comrade. <BR> <BR>&#34;No you didn&#39;t. You put up a tremendous fight.&#34; Roketh said as he glanced back over at the foursome of dragons, each standing and waiting patiently. <BR> <BR>&#34;My turn.&#34; Roketh mumbled as he began to stand. Then, a hand shot out and grasped his. Roketh quickly looked down to see a blackish red aura surrond Azurian. <BR> <BR>&#34;No, you can&#39;t!&#34; Roketh pleeded as he tried to pry his hand free from the demon&#39;s, &#34;You need your strength.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m already dead, master. I failed you once, I shall not fail you again.&#34; Azurian&#39;s glow bagan to fade. <BR> <BR>Roketh looked down at his wounds. A large hole was in his right side, in his left where four, large stab wounds. Blood was pouring out of both. Azurian&#39;s grip loosened and his hand fell out of Roketh&#39;s. Azurian&#39;s head fell back, hitting the ground with a sickening thud. His scythe began to glow bright red. It then seemed to condense into a small red ball. The ball hovered for a few seconds before slamming into Roketh&#39;s chest. Roketh was knocked on his back, the power surging into him. Then the red light faded. Roketh arose, feeling stronger than ever. He looked down on his fallen servent. He knew what must be done, just as Azurian knew what had to be done. <BR> <BR>His gaze rose to meet that of the dark masters. His eyes narrowed as he took a step towards them. <BR> <BR>&#34;Master, allow me please.&#34; Nightmare hissed as he prepared to attack. <BR> <BR>&#34;No.&#34; A voice rang. One of the other dragons stepped out, he was the second to largest. &#34;I am Galin, Lord of Destruction and the leader of the Vile Lords. I say it be Dragonaught whom shall slay you.&#34; This Dragon was a wicked chatactor to say the least. He was blue, with a long, narrow head. His ears were also pointed. He had two sets of arms. On each resided a solitary claw protruding off of the wrist. Natural, non-retractable claws. This dragon was a bit smaller than Nightmare, now that Nightmare had evolved. He stared on as the largest dragon spoke, the one Roketh could not see. He was the largest by far, but in thanks to the darkened skies and the shadows of the forest, he lay in the darkness as he spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now now son, I think that Nightmare had a score to settle with this fiend was it not?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Y-yes father. You are correct. Nightmare, you are to destroy them all, then the surronding countryside. Incinerate it all or perish at my hands.&#34; Galin said as he shot a quick gaze at Nightmare. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, sir. The pleasure is all mine.&#34; Nightmare said with his trademark grin. <BR> <BR>Then, Nightmare dove at Roketh. Roketh stood there, not moving. Nightmare swung with all his might. With blinding speed Roketh&#39;s hand shot up and caught the fist in mid-air. Nightmare attempted to get free from the titanic dragon&#39;s grasp. It was now that Nightmare sensed the considerable power increase. Nightmare&#39;s other hand grabbed his own wrist, still attempting to get free. Nightmare became enraged, bellowing an un-earthly roar. The ground around them began to quake. Roketh kept the same face, the same stance. Purple lightning struck all around them from the skies. Rock shoot up and smashed about them as Nightmare began to un-leash his true powers. A small, clear, purlpe dome appeared around them. Nightmare still struggled. Then, Roketh released his grasp. Nightmare darted back and stared in dis-belief. None could match his power save the other lords. How had he grown so strong? Roketh returned his hand to his side and stared at the purple beast. <BR> <BR>&#34;Bloodlust....Denemaur...I barely knew them when you slayed them. However, they were my brethern. I made a promise over their graves to avenge their deaths. Your day has come, Nightmare.&#34; <BR> <BR>Nightmare&#39;s hands filled with some form of purple lightning balls. Bolts begun to ricochet off the insides of the orbs. <BR> <BR>&#34;Not likely, fool. You believe you stand a chance? Ha. Even if you beat me, you&#39;ll never beat us. Plus you&#39;ll have quite the time accomplishing the first of those.&#34; Nightmare smiled. <BR> <BR>Nightmare&#39;s hands slammed together. The orbs melted into each other instantly and formed a large, purple ball of pure energy. Nightmare grasped it with both hands. He held it over his head and threw it with all his might. As the ball hurtled towards Roketh, he instantly had a flash of Denemour and Bloodlust, giving their lives for the world. Then Azurian had to do the same. He became enraged and felt a power like never before. He shot his gaze to the orb as it was about to connect. He reached down with his left hand and backhanded the orb strait into the air. It exploded in mid-air. The ensuing explosion was massive. The ground shook as ripples ran through the tops of the trees. Nightmare couldn&#39;t believe it. As Nightmare was looking up, he suddenly arched over as Roketh appeared from nowhere and planted a fist into his gut. When the smoke cleared, the other lords saw nightmare hunched over the fist of Roketh. Roketh then picked him up on his fist and hurled him towards the other lords. Nightmare lay still. Then, he shot up and charged at Roketh. A flurry of punches and kicks were then thrown at Roketh, who began dodgeing at an incredible speed. In the blur of fists and dodgeing, Jace pointed his staff at the purple fiends back. Jace fired off a shot into his back. Nightmare arched forward as the burning hit between his wings. He turned and saw Jace. He then cracked his trademark grin. Roketh stood there waiting for the next punch. Nightmare spun and shot a stream of fire towards the hapless human. Jace tried to jump to his left to aviod the flame. Roketh watched in terror as the shodowed form of Jace disappeared in the stream of fire. Nightmare grinned and spun, punching Roketh in the gut. His smile quickly faded as the massive dragon gave none. The fist hit, but didn&#39;t move. Like punching a rock, cept the rock would&#39;ve cracked. He glanced up only to see the elbow of Roketh reared in the air. <BR> <BR>&#34;MURDERER!&#34; He screamed as he dropped the elbow into the head of Nightmare. Nightmare fell flat on his stomache. He spun over on his back and swung both of his tails as hard as he could in an attepmt to trip Roketh. His tails hit, but they got resistance only hitting the earth itself could match. Roketh grabbed both of his tails and picked the massive dragon into the air. <BR> <BR>&#34;FIEND!&#34; He screamed with tears in his eyes. He jerked both hands in opposite direction in an attempt the rip him in half. Sadly, he only ripped one tail off. Nightmare&#39;s wail was a horrible sound to hear. His body was slung to the earth by the force of the opposing dragon. He looked up at the other lords, his eyes almost begging for aid. Before any could react, Roketh stomped on Nightmare&#39;s back. He placed one foot on his shoulder as blood ran out of his mouth. Nightmare half-cocked his head to look into the eyes of the victor. Roketh placed a foot on each shoulder and grabbed the massive dragon by the mane. <BR> <BR>&#34;For all my friends, and especially for Jace.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, Roketh twisted his head with blinding speed. The snap was the loadest one ever to be heard as it echoed off the cliffs and through the woods. He then pulled with all his might and ripped off the head of the purple beast. He then stood, faceing the Vile Lords. He threw the head towards Dragonaught, almost as a taunt. It bounced off the beast&#39;s chest and landed on the ground. Its blank eyes were staring up, still begging blankly. Dragonaught became enraged and charged at Roketh. He swung with his right hand as hard as he could. Roketh charged as well. He ducked and punched into Dragonaught&#39;s gut as hard as he could. A load crunching noise was heard, then both creatures stopped and dust flew. When it settled, Galin was in shock. They were both in the same position as when they stopped. However, the look of surprise on Dragonaught&#39;s face was only the begining. As his gaze fell to Roketh, he saw Roketh&#39;s fist next to his own head. Then he saw it. Roketh&#39;s fist had went through Dragonaught. <BR> <BR>&#34;....for Vyger.&#34; Roketh muttered as he pulled his hand free. Dragonaught fell limply to his left, never more to terrorize or kill. <BR> <BR>&#34;Dragonaught...Nightmare....my practical brothers. They were so...&#34; Galin made a few motions with his hands, &#34;...so weak. No room for weakness in this world.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh stared at the remaing two. The one in the shadows was almost getting delight from this. Then, with blinding speed, Galin nailed Roketh in the mouth with an uppercut type kick, conecting with his ankle. Roketh stumbled back, more shocked than hurt. This was would be trouble he knew. <BR> <BR>&#34;Let&#39;s just see how you do against some real compition.&#34; Galin grined as he got in a comfortable stance. Roketh knew this one...would not be easy. <BR> <BR> <BR>The Lord of Illusions and the Lord of Chaos have been slain. But even with his new power and knowledge, can Roketh hold his own against the strongest of the Knights of Darkness, The Lord of Destrustion, Galin?? Stay tuned.
