 The universe is pretty big, millennia pass away and time slips through it.  The ever-expanding universe has baffled nearly every race of it since it began.  Few know even a slight percentage of its secrets.  The few are the primals.  Human looking but with monster blood running through their veins.  In their day they had been the only creatures in a small universe.  They created monsters in their forms and then changed to humans.  Detan was one, the primal Durahan.  There were thirty-seven others.  They were the building blocks of the universe.  All by the same name, Detanracnier.  All monsters and humans alike are run by instinct.     Some monsters are naturally bad and some are naturally good.  There are also neutral monsters that are not torn either way.  In an unnamed corner of the universe a Kato sits drinking a thick red drink from a metal chalice.  It is sitting in the woods by a campfire and the moon is only just sticking through the trees.  Around it there are whispers but it is not worried.  A tree branch snaps underfoot but it just sits there sipping its ale.  Slowly three shapes slide through the darkness and into the light pool.  The Kato does not look up.  The shapes look at each other then one growled.  The Kato turns around to face a trio of lizards.  The growling one is black with longer legs and   deep yellow eyes.  The other two are green and longer from tip to tail.  The Kato laughs and carefully places down his drink.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Money, food, now!&#34; The black zuum hisses. <BR> <BR>The Kato just stares at them and lights a cigarette it has held in its hand.  The black kato smirks slightly then nods to the others.  They advance slowly on the furry cat. It extends its claws and waits.  Then there is a flash.  Blood sprays from a deep flash wound on one of the green lizards face.  The other turns and sees the cat flash past him leaving a similar mark.  They both get angry and charge, claws open, teeth showing.  The Kato calmly sips from a jug on the floor.  There is a flash of light and a sudden excess of heat.  Two singed bodies fall to the floor.  The black zuum hissed louder and spat green saliva from the back of his throat.  The Kato laughs slowly as the dark figuire jumps ready to pounce.  The kato suddenly melds shape, hair retreats into pail skin and claws turn into fingers.  There is a blast and the Kato falls to the ground.  The man holding the gun smiles lightly then drags the three bodies.   <BR> <BR>There is a black market on dead monsters.  Few know where they turn up but it is said some are made into resin, fur coats and the like.  A man wearing a long apron walked forward from the shadows.  His face was still obscured by darkness but he was holding a meat cleaver in his hands and there was blood on the apron.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Who is it?&#34;  His voice was cold and stunk of smoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;It’s me, got three zuum here.  What you paying?&#34;  Detanarcnier said slowly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well I spose they&#39;re all right in size but I dunno, they&#39;re not very ra…&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Shut it, I know that business is rough at this time so I can pretty much name my price, trust me it will be higher than yours.&#34;   <BR> <BR>&#34;4000 G.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;4500.&#34; <BR> <BR>The man nodded in the shadows and grabbed the tails of the dead creatures.  His stall opened and he pulled the limp bodies into its depths.  The man was no where to be seen but a Kato was rummaging through the trash cans of a nearby hotel.   <BR> <BR>&#34;This looks bad.&#34;  Shouted Kain. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh really? You don&#39;t say.&#34; Shouted a tired Zack. <BR> <BR>Kain tilted his sword and swung it powerfully, a trident fell to the ground lifeless but more were advancing.  Fierce was trying to fend off several of them but each time he hit something he was left vulnerable to three hits.  Detan was in his Durahan form and slaying creatures with speed.  There wer just to many.  The tridents had been attacking a village on a small planet and the group had arrived there only an hour ago.  Already the whole hive was at war with them.    <BR> <BR>&#34;Air shot!&#34;  The primal shouted. <BR> <BR>His palm was open and aimed at the oncoming tridents.  Slowly a ball of air formed in his hand like a mini tornado, the air was compressed so it was hard.  It fired off and exploded sending three tridents flying.  Villagers were helping them and doing an ok job.  A few had monsters and Kain saw a solid rock wall totally flatten a trident.  When it turned upright the creature was just a shiny ball.  Slowly the tridents died down and eventually they were all gone.  Kain helped a man walk back to the village he had been stabbed.  When unarmed people went up against monsters was when people got hurt.  The rock hard skin of the nagas had been hard to penetrate with the blunt pitchfork the man had been carrying but his skin was like butter to the monsters claws. The village was pretty much normal by the time they got back.  Villagers who had not been fighting had rebuilt most of the destroyed buildings.   <BR> <BR>On another planet a thick long line was traveling through the mountains.  It was a huge colony of creatures.  They half bounced, half slithered along on their tails following the leader.  The suezos were desperately following their primeval instincts and going to the suezos paradise-The suezo breeding grounds.  On some planets the monsters were still breeding naturally. The suezo traveled for a little longer until they reached the passageway leading to the paradise.  They knew what was going to happen next.  The lead suezo stopped, turned to face them, and jumped out of their way. A barrage of scrambling creatures ran through the cave towards the garden that would hold their eggs.  The leader slowly changed form and smiled lightly.  He was of medium height with an eye patch and a long brown coat.  He walked back in the direction of the small town and fumbled around with a gun in his hand.  <BR> <BR>The ship did what it had done so often and sped through space.  Detan and the others were in a large room that was totally empty bar a large wooden crate.  It was coffin shaped and had metal bars across the girth of it.   <BR> <BR>&#34;What is it?&#34;  Asked Lisa. <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t know, the metalners gave it to me when we left.  I forgot to open it.&#34;  Detan mumbled. <BR> <BR>He looked the coffin up and down then whistled in awe.  His arms moved like lightning and his sword was in his hands.  Kain jumped back a little then relaxed as Detan forced the thin blade into a gap in the coffin.  It took a while but the box gave way and its front fell away.  Inside was a glow of silver.  Kain stared at it.  The object inside the box clicked and a hologram shone out.  A metalner was dancing strangely and talking.  It was how the metalners did hologram messages.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank you Lancelot.  We are forever in your debt.  May we offer you this warrior as an object of our happiness and respect.&#34;  It said in a electronic voice.     <BR> <BR>The hologram stopped and retreated back into the box.  Inside the coffin was what looked like a giant space suite.  It was a giant, silver man shape, but to big for a man and had an air pack on the back.  Its face was hidden in a flashing helmet on its head.  Huge hands and feet were held by thinner arms and legs and the machine looked amazing.  Then its finger slowly shook.  Its neck turned very slightly.  The suite was alive itself.  It slowly climbed from the coffin and knelt down to Detans level.  It seemed to be inspecting him.  Slowly it nodded and stood up to full height again.  It clicked again and the dancing metalner holographically appeared again. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am a strong monster sent to be Lancelot&#39;s.  Please raise me as your own to help you fight the evils of the universe.&#34;   <BR> <BR>The metalner beeped and was gone inside the silver giant.   <BR> <BR>&#34;I think it&#39;s an astro, some type of golem monster.&#34;  Lisa said observantly. <BR> <BR>The shiny golem nodded and punched the air as to say yes.  Detan smiled and rubbed the back of its metal leg. <BR> <BR>&#34;Looks strong enough, yeah I&#39;ll raise it.&#34;  He said happily. <BR> <BR>The golem looked from side to side and then walked out of the room.  He was heading for the ranch where a group of baku were training. <BR> <BR>The air was dark and grey over the gypsy caravans.  There was a crash and a sudden burst of speed.  Two creatures ran through the rows of caravans with a man on their tails.  Both of the creatures were fairly small.  One was fatter with long floppy ears and long feet, the other had shorter ears but larger eyes.  They ran together through the night.  There was a growl ahead of them and the hopper ran straight into something.  He fell back and landed on his tail.  From the shadows came a pack of growling. A pack of jaggd hound was waiting there.  The hopper turned to see the man chasing them laughing.   <BR> <BR>&#34;You dirty little thieves aint gonna be taking no more of our food, nows hand it over!&#34;  The man chuckled menacingly. <BR> <BR>The hare was thinking, he turned to the hopper. <BR> <BR>&#34;There&#39;s five of them, think we can take them?&#34;       <BR> <BR>The man looked shocked. <BR> <BR>&#34;You little thieves can talk?&#34;  He said. <BR> <BR>&#34;In that case your worth a lot more than I thought,  Try to get the varmints alive guys.&#34;  He said. <BR> <BR>The pack decnded on the two little critters.  The hare sighed a little. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh well.&#34; He said. <BR> <BR>Then there was a flash of fur and the nearest tigers face was knocked away.  The hopper flicked viciously at another creatures snout sending blood all over his hands.  One of the jaggd hounds went to bite the hare, the fluffy eared critter jumped over him and sent him flying forwards with a swift kick.  Three of the hounds were knocked unconscious before the man and the other ran back to their caravan.   <BR> <BR>The two monsters walked calmly a little further until they were a good distance from the caravan site.   <BR> <BR>&#34;What you get?&#34;  Asked the hopper. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fish, shirts, base ball bat, some good stuff.&#34;  The hare said from inside a bag.   <BR> <BR>Slowly the pair turned into humans.  One was male with a pair of large sunglasses the other was female with a small crown.  The peaks of the crown made the hares ears.  They walked a little further towards a shop and came out with some money.  The primals all had lives, yet they all knew what was coming. <BR> <BR>Kain knocked on the door, the doors was silver as was pretty much the whole ship.  Detan was inside mumbling to himself inside.  Kain knocked again but it was obvious Detan couldn&#39;t hear him.  He slowly opened the door and slid in.  Detan was inside in his primal form.  He was talking to the wall. As Kain walked around he saw the wall had a strange floating portal on its surface.  He listened intently. <BR> <BR>&#34;WE CANNOT DO IT!&#34;  A voice called from inside the portal. <BR> <BR>&#34;We have to, we were brought to this universe to do it.&#34;  Another screamed. <BR> <BR>The voices went on.  Kain was shocked into silence.  They spoke of events occurring before the beginning of time, the y spoke of dead hero&#39;s and villains but what scared Kain was something terrible.  They were the protectors of the universe and yet what they spoke of.  Kain ran from the room but Detan heard him.  He turned and gasped. Kain ran and ran through the ship, past different training creatures.  He was heading for the house. He had to tell them.  There was a crash and he fell to the floor, his face in great pain.    He looked up, the astro stood before him.  On his shoulder stood Detan.  The astro stamped just next to Kain.  If it had landed on him it would have been fatal.      <BR> <BR>&#34;Why would you spy on me?  Why?&#34;  Detan shouted. <BR> <BR>&#34;I cannot believe you, I thought you were good.&#34;  Kain spat the words out. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am.  Sometimes we must make sacrifices.&#34; Detan looked like he meant it, Kain was still angry. <BR> <BR>&#34;I have to tell them, we had a right to…&#34; Kain began. <BR> <BR>&#34;Then I am sorry.&#34;  He bowed his head and tried not to look at Kain.  <BR> <BR>Detan waved his hand vaguely at Kain and the creature lumbered forward.  He forced his foot at Kain.  It had not been a powerful kick but his leg was massive, it was like being hit by a brick wall.  Kain&#39;s face dripped blood and he could not stand up.  He heard a beep by his head and turned to see Bolt.  That’s what he needed. Bolt turned and evilly stared at the golem.  It had no face but just gave out a blank expression.   Bolt turned to face the sad Detan and hissed.  Bolt was really angry.  He opened his pinsirs and lunged forward at the golem.  It was a hard attack and the golems leg gave way slightly.  He stumbled a little and looked angry.  Its huge hand swung out at Bolt who dodged it easily.  Detan was still not looking at Kain.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Whats going on?  Kain are you ok?&#34;  Zack and Lisa were standing with their monsters.   <BR> <BR>&#34;The…Detan…other primals all have the….stop him, help Bolt.&#34;  Kain spluttered. <BR> <BR>Zack turned and pointed at the golem.  Fierce leapt forward and fired a huge green missile from his beak.  It exploded in the golems face and Detan was sent flying off.  Lisa drew her sword and pointed it at Detans throat.  She was shaking.  Her eyes were watering.  Detan looked worried. <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t do it.  Let me explain, I know I should have but it is inevitable.&#34;  He said.  <BR> <BR>Meanwhile destiny and the giant golem were trading punches.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Call him off you <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>!&#34;  Lisa screamed and mumbled at the same time.  She sounded very unsure. <BR> <BR>Detan clicked his fingers and the golem stopped.   <BR> <BR>Lisa withdrew her sword and helped him up.  Kain was standing mopping at his face with his sleeve.  Detan looked like he was going to melt.  He looked sadly at Kain and then to the others.   <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m sorry I did not tell you but it&#39;s difficult.&#34;  He said again. <BR> <BR>&#34;Tell them you <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>!&#34; Kain said bitterly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok Kain I&#39;m sorry.  There are others like me, thirty-seven others.  Each breed has a primal.  We are the creators and such.  We were made to look after the universe.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah we already knew that, what&#39;s the problem.&#34;  Lisa said solemnly.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Well we were made to look after the universe, not the people or creatures in it.  We made a decision along time ago, before we made the universe.  If it came to a point where the universe would be better off without residence then we would compress it.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Compress it?  What the hell does that mean?&#34;  Zack shook the old mans jacket with both hands. <BR> <BR>&#34;Compressing is making the universe smaller.  Taking out all the unnecessary data, all the space will be taken away.  Only core things will be left.  It will be like rewriting the universe or wiping it clean.  We would be able to monitor and look after it much more easily.&#34; <BR> <BR>Zack let go of his jacket and dropped him to the floor.  Kain was walking backwards and forwards.  Lisa was hugging Destiny&#39;s waist and had her eyes closed. <BR> <BR>&#34;So in a very shirt time we shall leave the universe.  It is a trick only the primals can do.  We shall leave and restart the universe like a computer.  All life inside it will be destroyed, humans and monsters alike.  There is a point we must go to in the universe, the ship is heading there now.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Why do you have to do this Detan?&#34;  Lisa said slightly more composed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Even if I don&#39;t they will!  I am just one thirty eighth of the equation.  They can do it without me.  It only takes half of the primals to do it.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Then we will talk to half of the primals.  You know that you cannot do it.&#34;  Kain said. <BR> <BR>Detan went to object then thought.  Humans and monsters were what made the universe.  They expanded it they helped it move along.  Their life force kept it going.  Wheather it was from a tiny yellow mew bursting from an egg in front of its parents or a family of tigers howling at the moon when a leader died.  The universe needed them. He stood up silently and headed for the room.  The portal was till open and all the primals were there.   <BR> <BR>&#34;We cannot do it.&#34;  Detan said loudly without shouting. <BR> <BR>The ships were all heading for the point where they could leave.  The one Kain was already waiting there.  Detan explained that it was the center of the universe.  There were no stars or planets in eyes distance.  It was just thick darkness.  Total space.   Slowly the other ships arrived.  Most arrived solo whilst a few arrived in twos and threes.  Eventually there were a convoy of thirty-eight ships.  The center of the universe had a strange gravity about it.  The ships were wing to wing, all in a circuit around the very center.  It was amazing to watch.  Kain looked out of a bay window into space.  In one direction there was nothing, in the other was a huge ring of ships hovering.   <BR> <BR>Detan stared at the wall, the portal was still open but there was just one person there.  This meant it showed his face and top half of his body.  He had a thin face and sharp teeth for a human.  His hair was slick and greased back into two spikes.   <BR> <BR>&#34;The others are ready to start the process.  Come to the point and talk to them, not that it will help your case at all.  Then we shall begin the process.  If you want to join us again then feel free.&#34;  His voice was quiet and angry.   <BR> <BR>Kain was watching the center of the universe when it happened.  He jumped back.  One of the ships had a glowing ball of white light on its wings.  Others were slowly gathering the balls elsewhere.  Suddenly a bolt of lightning fired from one of the lights.  It gathered with others at the center of the universe.  He felt the ship judder as it fired its beam.  The lightning was forming a platform of somekind.  Detan walked over to Kain.   <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m sorry Kain, whatever happens I am sorry.&#34;  Detan said with his hand on Kain&#39;s shoulder. <BR> <BR>Kain smiled. <BR> <BR>&#34;I know you will try your hardest.&#34;  He smiled.   <BR> <BR>Detan flashed and turned into the duruhan.  He nodded at Kain and opened a door. It lead onto an air lock.  Kain pressed the button and the duruhan walked out of the ship, down the stairway and onto the platform.   Gravity did not seem to affect them.  Kain returned to the window with Lisa and Zack.  There were thirty-eight creatures out there.  The black face of a monol extended from its wall body.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Who is here?  Say your name and type.&#34;  His voice was extremely hollow like it was being shouted from along way off.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Lilliam, pixie.&#34;   <BR> <BR>&#34;Bizzaro, dragon.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Blade, centaur.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Segme, color Pandora.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Naught, beaclon.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Digit, hengar.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Charles, wracky.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Rocky, golem.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Thistle, zuum.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Lancelot, Durahan.&#34;  Detan said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ruby, Arrow head.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Pezzy, tiger&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Flip, hopper&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Fluffy, hare&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Giga, baku&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Gold face, Gali&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Haga, Kato&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Monstro, Zilla&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Jinn, Bajaarl&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Mopsy, Mew&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Flame, Phoenix&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sprite, Ghost&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Shock, Metalner&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yetis, Jill&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Cyclops, Suezo&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Pink, Moochi&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Scythe,  Joker&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Clay, Gaboo&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Aqua, Jell&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Nymph, Undine&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sheller, Niton&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Oak, Mock&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Panic, Ducken&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;chloro, Plant&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Blake, Monol&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Mage, Ape&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sting, Worm&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Venom, Naga&#34; <BR> <BR>The list of names sounded off.  The naga slithered up in front of the mass of creatures and cleared its throat. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now my friendssss, Lancelot has something to explain.  He does not think we shoul rewrite the universe, he wants to continue as we started.&#34;  As the words hissed from his mouth all the monsters whispered hurriedly. <BR> <BR>&#34;We cannot get rid of the cretures who live here.  You have forgotten what the universe.  To creatures like Venom it is just our project.  To the creatures it is a home.  You cannot evict them from existnence just becuase you feel like it.  They have a right to this earth.&#34;  Lancelot pleaded. <BR> <BR>There was silence and then a clap.  One creature was clapping.  It was a hengar.  Slowly both flip and fluffy began to clap.  Half the creatures joined the clap with cries and shouting.  The others just scowled at Lancelot.   <BR> <BR>&#34;You cannot abort the plan, it has been inforced as a law for millions of years.&#34;   <BR> <BR>&#34;We don&#39;t want to destroy them and the teams are split down the middle.  You lose i&#39;m afraid.  With only nineteen creatures on your side you cannot exit the universe.&#34;  Lancelot smiled. <BR> <BR>&#34;Then we sahll force you!&#34;  The naga spat. <BR> <BR>Some of his followers seemed uneasy, they were above fighting.  Venom turned to them and shouted. <BR> <BR>&#34;They cannot change their minds after so long!&#34;  <BR> <BR>This settled it.  The two teams charged at each other.  Kain coul hardly tell what was happening.  He tried to focus on creatures.  <BR> <BR>The hare that had agreed with Lancelot was jumping over tongues of flame spat from the katos mouth.  Fluffy leapt over a red hot wave and punched the kato, sending him flying.   <BR> <BR>Elsewhere a golem was swinging at an evil suezo.  Though his hands were big, they were slow and the suezo was avoiding the hits easily.  It fired a blast of light from its eye and the golem fell to the floor.  <BR> <BR>A galent tiger was blasting a blue, freezing bolt of ice at a zuum whos flame was holding the beam back.  The two attacks combined and formed an explosion that sent both creatures flying.   <BR> <BR>Lancelot was swinging his sword at a nasty looking tree.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Leaf gatling.&#34; It cried as hundreds of leafs went flying at Lancelot. <BR> <BR>He blocked them off with his shield then opened his palm. <BR> <BR>&#34;Blast shot!&#34; A ball of electric air formed in his hand and went flying at the mock.  Bark went flying as it connected and the mock screamed. <BR> <BR>Kain felt sick.  The creatures would battle until there was just one left.  They would continue killing each other and the ones left at the end would do what they wanted.  Kain wasn&#39;t the only one to notice this.  Venom had Flip the hopper upside down by his tail. <BR> <BR>&#34;No body move!&#34; he hissed. <BR> <BR>The battle stopped.  Fluffy looked hopelessly at his best friend.   <BR> <BR>&#34;So, are you willing to sacrafice this hoppers life in order of your cause.  I will kill him now and then take them one by one until they are all dead.  Do the project.&#34; <BR> <BR>Lancelot looked around desperately.  There did not seem to be any way out of it.  He placed his sword on to the floor and Kain closed his eyes.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Good, now do it!&#34;  The naga cried. <BR> <BR>Slowly each creature closed their eyes.  They slowly seemed to be splitting in two.  Like bacteria.  A spirit came from each creature and flew into a ball.  The balls gathered togethor and collected at the center of the universe.  There was a tiny bang.  A hole appeared there.  It was tiny but sucking in space.  As it sucked in more space it got bigger.  IT got larger and larger.  The universe was swallowed.  It was gone. <BR> <BR> <BR>The the hole universe was spat back out.  The naga hissed angrily. <BR> <BR>&#34;What went wrong!!!&#34; He screamed.  Green, blue and purple lights were dancing in the air.  Kain looked around in awe.  The lights were slowly fading into the background.   <BR> <BR>Lancelot was smiling.  He held out his arms and several lights were absorbed into him. <BR> <BR>&#34;You cannot win Venom.  The unuiverse has too much life force.  It wont let you.&#34;  He was laughing. <BR> <BR>Venom swore loudly and slithered into his ship.  It flashed and it was gone.  All around the monsters were apoligising to each other.  Kain watched and smiled.  Bolt looked scared.  Eventually they all returned to their ships and left the center of the universe.  The universe was infinite.  It would never be destroyed by the primals.   <BR> <BR>I like this story.  It leads off nicely fro jokers are wild &#40;The previos episode for those who have not read it yet&#41;.

 It must be said... <BR> <BR>Nearly every aspiring author suffers from one universal flaw when they start writing, even me.  <BR>Length. I must admire your long-windedness. It must also be said that this pleases me. It says a lot for your abilities. <BR> <BR>Now don&#39;t go thinking you&#39;re perfect, I still see alot of room for improvment in your writings, mainly flow. However, your diction is becoming increasingly better as this story continues. Keep&#39;em rollin&#39; buddy.
