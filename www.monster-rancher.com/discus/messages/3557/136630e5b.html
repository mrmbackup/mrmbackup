 As the two objects hurtled toward Earth, the Zans began to panic. But up in the sky, a piece of history began to replay. The two objects were masks of some sort. One was pale, with a red nose and a sadistic grin. Maybe it was some form of the supernatural, but the pale mask became surrounded by a viel of darkness. But this viel was more than it seemed, a kind of entity of sorts, for it began to speak. <BR> <BR>&#34;So it begins again.&#34; the darkness said.&#34;And this time I will be the victor.&#34; As if summoned, a shining light engulfed the sun-shaped mask. It replied. <BR> <BR>&#34;You are wrong.&#34; it said.&#34;I shall not allow you to continue your evil, even if it costs my life.&#34; The darkness began to laugh. It wasn&#39;t any normal laugh, it was a dark laugh, an evil twisted laugh, a laugh that seemed to reach into your very soul and turn it to solid ice. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll be sure to make that happen.&#34; it hackled. <BR> <BR>&#34;Listen,&#34; the light began.&#34;if this fight must happen, let us take it elsewhere. Leave the planet and its people out of it.&#34; The darkness let loose another soul shattering laugh. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh on the contrary my friend. I see this planet only as an arena, a field for our battle to transpire upon. When it&#39;s gone, we&#39;ll move to another until I reign supreme.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;How can you say that?!&#34; the light began.&#34;If-&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh justice, oh unity, oh peace, oh BLAH...BLAH...BLAH! You&#39;d save a flower before you saved your own skin! As far as I&#39;m concerned, the more blood that&#39;s shed, the more fun I have. Once I find a host, I intened to lett all hell break loose down there!&#34; Suddenly, a strong gust of wind began to blow. Both entities dissapeared. The golden mask was hit with a full blast of the wind and was blown off course. The pale mask stayed on its previous course, heading straight for the panicing village below, who were completely oblivious to what had just took place. All that concerned them was the doom heading their way.

 Cool, but it could have been a lot longer. These masks, you&#39;re talking about Joker and Gali, right? Like I said, it could have been longer. But it does give you a little info on what is coming up.

 Have you read the prouloge? It helps to explain a lot. Yes I am talking about Joker and Gali. I use the MR2 Joker mask because I think it seems more maniacle and menacing, ya know just plain insane. It&#39;s short because I origionally intended it to be in CH1, but I accidentally clicked the post button instead of the down arrow.

 The MR2 Joker does look the most menacing. I also thought of Mahjor as an MR2 Joker, but having a cooler looking mask.
