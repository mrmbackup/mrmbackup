 Here&#39;s Part VII <BR> <BR>“First off, you came here by way of teleportation. You can thank Ice Queen, my Ripper, for that. You look puzzled. Oh, my monsters? Yeah, no one has ever seen them before. I get that a lot. Ice Queen is a Ripper. That’s what the “experts” call her, and that big bloke over there is my Madillo, Percy. He’s a bit slow, but comes through in a pinch, eh?” Percy just smiled back. All I could do was sit there and listen to her gab on, and on. I looked around the room, seeing Ice Queen and Percy. The Ripper was a sleek weasel like thing that stood about to my shoulders. She was sleek with very sharp claws, and couldn’t seem to stand still for more than two minutes. Percy, on the other hand, was cool and collected. When standing -I hadn’t seen him stand yet- he would’ve been to my waist, but just because he was a bit short, doesn’t mean he was small. Not in the least was he small. He was very chunky, but in the burly way, with green plating over parts of his brownish skin. Lifting large objects were probably of the simplest tasks for him. Unlike Ice Queen, he didn’t seem to be overly bright, but he was wise, with eyes that just sparkled no matter what light they were in.  <BR> <BR>These monsters were very peculiar indeed, almost as strange as my two. Kari was a bit shorter than I. She had long, brown curly hair with maroon streak running down it to near the left ear. I thought I had a few freckles, but she had many more, many many more. She had a slight English accent, but you could notice it when she spoke. Also, she was dolled up, like she was going somewhere important. Pondering these new surroundings, I remembered all that had happened that night before. That is, if it only was the night before. <BR> <BR>“What day is it?” I asked her <BR> <BR>“Well, let’s see. Uh, it’s the 26 of October. Yeah, that’s right. You’ve been asleep for five days. Teleportation of that magnitude usually takes it out on the one who was teleported, unless they’re used to it like me ‘n Percy.” <BR> <BR>“But,” I was more confused than ever, “what happened at the match? Did that madman, Jacques, get away? Did he take anyone else?” <BR> <BR>“You probably have many questions, so just sit down, and let me explain.” She looked as if I asking so many questions at once peeved her. “When Xavier was about to attack, I had Ice Queen teleport you here. I was on orders from Thomas.” <BR> <BR>“Wait, you know Thomas, Thomas Marcus?” <BR> <BR>“Yes! Now, let me finish!” I had annoyed her further. “Jacques also took one named Hannah Wagonblast. She is the Soul Master of Golem and Gaboo.” <BR> <BR>“Hannah’s one of those Soulful Mastery Thingys? Isn’t that what Jacques said I was? I wonder what he has to do with them…” <BR> <BR>“AHEM! If you don’t want to know why you’re here, or what to do next, then just keep on interrupting, if not, sit down, get comfortable, and SHUT YOU MOUTH!” She was thoroughly ticked off now. I had really done it. <BR> <BR>“I’m sorry I’m sorry. Please continue.”  <BR> <BR>“As I was saying before so rudely disturbed,” she looked straight in my direction, “he has taken her and Gavin to separate areas, same as he has done with the others, so they cannot plot together. You and I are the only two remaining Soul Masters. Jacques usually makes a capture quick and cleanly, but no this time. You see, you were not expected. The supposed Soul Master of the Gitan and the Ogyo has already been captured. Kirsten, her name, has kept silence about it so that the true Master will hopefully not be captured. Jacques was at the match to catch Gavin and Hannah, but when he saw you execute a Soul Attack, everything changed. He realized that he had the wrong person. I shudder to think what he has done with Kirsten. I grew up with her, you know. Ok, NOW, is the time for your questions.” <BR> <BR>“You said that you and I are the last, but I have been told that Thomas is a Soul Master as well? What, do you think he is captured or something?” All Kari did was hang her head in a sad yes. “OK, ok, this sucks. So, what exactly is Jacques purpose?” <BR> <BR>“I don’t know for sure, but I do know that he has been hired by someone else. There is something quite sinister about this, you have probably noticed it too, am I right?” I nodded my head in agreement. <BR> <BR>“Then, what do we do now?” <BR> <BR>“There are rumors of something called the Third Soul. It is a monster that a pair of Soul Monsters can combine with, giving it both of their powers. The interesting part, however, is that the monsters can be uncombined. This is called the Tri-Combination. This monster has never been found. No one even knows what species it is. Your only hop of finding it is freeing these three Soul Masters: Hannah, Gavin, and Thomas; Hannah, because of the extensive research she has done on the Third Soul, Gavin, because of his grand battle knowledge, and Thomas, because, well… don’t you want to rescue your friend? I would try finding them in the order I said, because it is in that order that they are guarded. Hannah shall be the easiest to get. Find her first. <BR> <BR>When she had said Thomas, something changed in her voice, which made me uneasy. “Alright. Devlin, Stefioni, are you guys up to the challenge?” Devlin cackled joyously and Stefioni whistled happily and did flips in the air. They were obviously ready to follow me anywhere. “Good, where do I go first?” <BR> <BR>“You must go to the town of Hyander. You will find mercenaries who will help you.” <BR> <BR>“I haven’t any money, how can I pay for mercenaries.” <BR> <BR>“They are already paid for” <BR> <BR>“Oh, cool. You know what? It seems like just yesterday I had found Thomas’s disc.” <BR> <BR>“Yeah, well, it seems like that for all of us; just yesterday, I mean. Anyway, I must take my leave, for I have very pressing business to attend to. You’re welcome for saving you. Now, farewell!” Just like that, Ice Queen teleported Kari and Percy, along with herself. They were gone in an instant.  <BR> <BR>“Huh,” I said to Devlin and Stefioni, “Look at what a fine mess we’ve gotten ourselves into. We’d better go.” I chuckled, left the inn, and we were on our way to Hyander, not knowing what would befall us.
