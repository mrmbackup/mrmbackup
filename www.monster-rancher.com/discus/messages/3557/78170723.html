 &#40;Take note: this is not the story, merely a classic legend of the time and location. I&#39;m merely adding depth to a lore that I have created, part of a culture I also created, that I will later define.&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>    In the history of Jenko Minito, the tale of the Devil&#39;s Tower was always said to be a legend, only a legend. The tower stands tall, fortified on its position on Mount Remacto. On top of the known world. <BR> <BR>    In an ancient time, there was a golden titan, named Cladius Antimicus. He was not actually golden, say for pigment, but he was the most kind and loved of all the supernatural beings that existed at the time. During the war of Cladius and Klymain, Cladius was the one that lead the human, dwarf, and elvish armies against the hordes of monstrosities camped on Mount Remacto. Now, for the most part, Orcs, Goblins, Ogres, Yeti types, and even the feared Crognus breeds were relatively peaceful. They traded on occasion with humans or other groups of the like, and most often preferred drunken brawls with each other than open warfare. Nay, not their fault in this instance. <BR> <BR>    It was their deity that had corrupted them, all of them, and called them to arms. They had destroyed much, but now they had returned to the great mountain. In this grand tower, the arch mage Remacto was summoning the spirit into living flesh. To guide them to victory, to scorch the land, the same old diabolical scheme most villains concocted. However, unlike most scenarios, this one almost succeeded. Remacto did in fact bring this fiend to life, but within his own self. The beast was called Klymain. It grew from the human shell. In the highest recess of the tower it grew larger. The top of the great spire shattered before the gazing armies of evil. The whole tower was not destroyed, as the thing grew rapidly. Soon, it was standing well over than Remacto&#39;s home. The remaining 75% of the tower was roughly the size of Klymain&#39;s leg. He was the size of a titan now, if one would say he himself was not a titan. Klymain lead his troops well, and himself was a deadly advisory. By the end of his first year, he had slain every titan in the known world. Cladius rose an army to combat his, and eventually Klymain was pushed back to the tower&#39;s location. <BR> <BR>    The demon&#39;s description was sketchy, but it was said when he saw Cladius, the last titan, leading the final army of good, his lips pulled back in a full snarl. He barely sounded a charge as he dove towards Cladius, taking huge demonic strides. His claws barred and ready to find another bloody purchase. As many titans as he&#39;d killed, this one should be no problem. It was also  <BR>reported similarly on the side of good. That, when seeing the visage of Klymain, Cladius howled a charge and barreled toward the rampaging fiend. Cladius drew his massive sword, known as Bladeburn, and proceeded to combat the monster almost dead in front of Devil&#39;s Tower. The battle was said to be so fierce, that neither army made it past the titans. Everyone on all sides of the battle stopped and stared in astonishment and their gods slugged it out. <BR> <BR>    How the victory was won is not known, as very few people found themselves able to take notes during the fray. What we do know is that Cladius won, barely. He slammed Klymain&#39;s body into the mountain. Cladius then proceeded to stomp Klymain deep into the earth. He buried Klymain there, and then he grasped the remaining part of the tower, uprooted it, and impaled it into the ground on top of Klymain. They said that the mountain seemed to bleed. Blood ran from under the tower, yet the structure held still. After that day, Cladius retreated because of his wounds, and was never seen again. It was said he was disgusted with the nature of the world, and now he was the only titan left, maybe the planet would be better off without  <BR>any of them. <BR> <BR>    After many years, the ground of Mount Remacto is still red. The dust seems to be from Mars itself. It is barren, all seeds that have been planted there have been drained before their first sprout, and none dare travel to the Devil&#39;s Tower. there have never been accounts of people going and returning, but several speculations have been made. Some say it leads to Klymain&#39;s heart, which is now a city inhabited by demons. Others say it will wake Klymain, and he would ravage the world once again. Some still say his spirit would inhabit you, and you would be the beast&#39;s new host. Others say you&#39;d become a god. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#40;Feedback please, Just trying new things. and I know I&#39;m a bit rusty.&#41; CHB

 Also, the name Cladius is pronounced similair to Gladiator. <BR> <BR>Clad-ius &#40;Just for referrance&#41;
