 Chapter 2: Plans laid forth <BR> <BR>Much of the week was spent in preparation for what would be the most daring heist the raiders had ever attempted. Well, perhaps &#39;daring&#39; wasn&#39;t quite the right word. It was more like suicidal... <BR> <BR>Eclipse had waited eagerly for the day of the mission, but now that it was here, it seemed to come all too soon. He was nervous... the others were putting so much faith in him, trusting his instincts so completely that they&#39;d risk their lives on a dream. What if he was wrong? What if they found nothing truly worthwhile aboard that transport? Or worse...if something went wrong they&#39;d be captured and thrown into prison. No doubt to be publicly executed not long afterward, that was the fate of any who defied the Powers rule. As he packed up the equipment and tools needed Eclipse struggled to bury these doubts. If he allowed himself to be distracted and wasn&#39;t at his best for this job, then they&#39;d surely fail. There was just too much at stake. <BR> <BR>The sun wasn&#39;t even finished rising by the time Eclipse and Stinger set out into the barrens. The wasteland was never a beautiful sight, but at least in the morning it was a peaceful one. The winds were gentle, leaving no threat of the violent sandstorms that plagued the area. Only this early could one see into the distance and spot the ominous towers of the nearest monster city, or the errie ruins of human settlements closer by. The sky remained it&#39;s usual dull grey color. Eclipse had not seen a clear blue sky since he was a child. Strange clouds hung over the wasteland like a curse, and even when it rained, nothing grew... because the rains were poisonous. The two of them moved quickly, not wanting to be caught in another storm. They&#39;d be safer in the swamps... and that&#39;s where the mission would truly begin. Perhaps if - <BR> <BR>&#34;Eclipse!&#34; A certain loud Renocraft jarred the young man from his thoughts.  <BR> <BR>&#34;What?!? Don&#39;t startle me like that.&#34; He replied. Sometimes he wished that Stinger took more after his Henger side. Maybe he wouldn&#39;t be running his mouth-parts every second. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, ok? You just looked all serious.&#34; Stinger skittered along, leaving odd tracks in the sand. &#34;Your probably worried about the mission, don&#39;t be. This&#39;ll be pathetically easy. We&#39;ll be living large with our new score in no time.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;....Your crazy.&#34; That was all Eclipse could really say. This mission, easy? One wrong move and he&#39;d be some monsters new slave... and Stinger would be melted down into silverware. <BR> <BR>The rest of the trip was painfully uneventful, and finally they had reached the edge of the swamps. It was no natural quagmire, but a mist covered sewage dump. Somehow tree&#39;s had managed to grow here. Disgusting things really, with huge black trunks covered with sickly brown growths. Their roots seemed far more interested in reaching out and strangling the unwary then anything else. The raiders had long mapped out a route through this place, so they&#39;d be safe from those mutant tree&#39;s so long as they were careful. Eclipse still had to wear a face mask that covered his mouth and nose. The air was especially toxic to human beings. <BR> <BR>As for the plan, it was simple... and risky. A series of large pipes regularly dumped waste into swamp, which was how it was formed in the first place. Eclipse and Stinger would have to use the pipes to enter the city, slip into the slums without getting caught, get to a safe house that was waiting for them, disguise themselves, infiltrate the armored transport.... OK, perhaps it wasn&#39;t that simple, in fact it bordered on insane, but the raiders had actually pulled off a stunt like this once before. Everything depended on Eclipse and Stinger getting on board before the transport finished refueling. Then, once it had gotten far enough from the city, the raiders would attack. Eclipse and Stinger, working from the inside, in conjunction with the other raiders should make the cargo&#39;s takeover quick and efficient. That is, assuming everything went as planned... <BR> <BR>&#34;Do you hear something?&#34; Stinger inquired, whisking his companion from his private thought&#39;s once more. Eclipse listened, but actually couldn&#39;t hear a thing. More then once he&#39;d wished to have the same acute senses his friends possessed. The two of them were making good time, despite how cautious they had to be in the swamp, and it was another thirty minutes before Eclipse even began to hear the noise Stinger spoke of. <BR> <BR>&#34;Sounds like a gathering....best stay on your guard.&#34; He watched as Stinger nodded and shifted his tail into an attack position. For a split second he feared the sound was from a death squad. About a year ago the raiders first discovered the pipes that lead into the city, and took advantage of them often. Eventually the Powers caught on, and stationed packs of crazed jokers in these swamps. Suffice it to say, a lot of raiders lost their lives and this place had been designated off limits. Only in the last couple of months had the Joker patrols stopped, no doubt they were needed elsewhere because of the war. <BR> <BR>&#34;We&#39;re a little ahead of schedule, I&#39;m sure we can afford a peak at whatever&#39;s going on.&#34; Stinger went off in that direction before Eclipse could stop him. Truth be told, he was more then a little curious, but this was hardly the time to be nosy.  <BR> <BR>It wasn&#39;t long before they found the gathering, in a clearing where the air wasn&#39;t quite so foul and the ground firmer then the usual slush they were forced to walk on. Several monsters of various breeds stood before what looked like a pure Naga. Behind the Naga were three cages, each holding a filthly, sick looking human, two men and one woman in fact. They wore masks to protect them from the poisoned air, but that was just to keep them alive. Each wore several nasty bruises and claw marks... who knows what kind of hell they&#39;d been put through. It was clear what was going on now...an illegal slave auction. Monsters needed a license from the Powers to trade and sell human slaves. Those that didn&#39;t want to pay the annual fee, chose to trade their stock in secret, out of the way places. Shady sorts flocked to these auctions, as the slaves were always a lot cheaper then what you&#39;d find in the city. <BR> <BR>&#34;And now...&#34; The Naga hissed as one of the men, large and muscular, was brought out of the cage. Eclipse and Stinger continued to watch from beneath a shroud of mist. He felt a strange mix of curiosity and disgust, not being able to remember the last time he saw another human that wasn&#39;t some monsters pet. He couldn&#39;t help noticing that only the slaves hands were shackled. But then, it wasn&#39;t like there was anyplace to run to.  &#34;This ssspecimen will make an able servant once it iss broken. We will sstart the bidding at...&#34; <BR> <BR>Eclipse wasn&#39;t sure how, but the slave managed to work his hands out of those shackles. Before anyone could react he was whirling them like a morning star, and smashed the Naga in the side of the head. The blow caused the serpentine creature to reel, and the slave made a run for it. Actually, he wasn&#39;t a slave anymore was he? An Allure stood up to stop him, but he bashed her in the skull before she could cast a spell. A Zuum was the next to feel his wraith and even Eclipse could hear the disgusting &#39;crack&#39; of bone caving in on itself. In all the excitement they never realized that the mist had let up...enough to render the two raiders visible, and the escapee was running right towards them. Eclipse saw relief on his face at the sight of another human....and then rage at the sight of Stinger. He rushed forward...and it was clear Stinger was his next target. The Renocraft could have handled himself, but Eclipse&#39;s actions were instinctual. Without thinking, he stepped in front of the charging warrior and grabbed his wrists as he raised his hands to strike. <BR> <BR>Eclipse would never forget the look of confusion in that man&#39;s eyes...nor the look of deep betrayal that would soon follow. That one moment was enough for the other monsters to catch up, and suddenly the former slave jerked violently. As blood seeped from his lips Eclipse realized a Naga&#39;s claw was sticking out of his chest. The Naga withdrew his talons....and it&#39;s prey collapsed to the ground in a twitching heap. His eyes were still open, and it seemed they were still focused on Eclipse. <BR> <BR>&#34;You&#39;ve a good ssslave,&#34; The Naga was speaking to Stinger of course, who just nodded and played along. The two of them were back on the path not long after, and a note was made not to get side-tracked anymore. Sometime later, it still bothered him... a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He had helped kill another human and left two others prisoners to suffer in dirty cages. But there was nothing he could have done. Human&#39;s were beneath monster-kind, that&#39;s just the way it is.  <BR> <BR>&#34;You ok?&#34; Stinger tapped his leg with his tail to get his friends attention. &#34;I know your not still thinking about what happened back there.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I am...and I don&#39;t thing I&#39;ll be forgetting for a while.&#34; Eclispe shook his head... &#34;Did I even do the right thing?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;WHAT? That slave was going to attack me. I&#39;d be surprised if you did any different.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;...He wasn&#39;t a slave...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It &#39;was&#39; a slave. Why are you even thinking about this. It was only a-&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;A what?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Forget it.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Only a human right? What the hell am I then??&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;A magic...?&#34; Stinger waited for a moment to see if he&#39;d be satisfied with that...and it was clear he wasn&#39;t. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, ok? But I see you as one of us. We all do. You act like one of us anyway. No human would stick his neck out to help someone else. Right?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I guess...&#34; Or was that simply what monsters believed. Funny how even the raiders believed what the Powers said about humans, despite being outlaws and criminals that could be executed on sight. Regardless, he didn&#39;t say anymore on the subject. It didn&#39;t matter in the face of a mission this vital, or this difficult... In due time they&#39;d be in the belly of a city infested with hostile monsters. Security would be even higher then usual. So much urgency... he wondered how it was possible to desire something that you&#39;ve never laid eyes on. Even if the others had not agreed, he&#39;d have attempted this mission on his own. Whatever that secret cargo was...they needed it. On that Eclipse would stake his life... <BR> <BR> <BR>&#40;&#40;Chapter 3 Comin real soon. ;&#41; &#41;&#41;
