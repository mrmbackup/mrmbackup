 Galin stood there, almost laughing as he stared at Roketh. His wrist claws retracted as he put all four arms to his side. Roketh rubbed some of the blood off his chin. Indeed it had been a good shot he took. Galin&#39;s power was immeasureable. Anyone could sense the power for this beast. It practically ingulfed him. Roketh was stronger, but short plenty of allies, all of them in fact. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well Lord of Lords, live up to your name.&#34; Galin grined, he was quite confident he could win. <BR> <BR>With that Galin rushed strait at Roketh. He swiped, but Roketh managed to see this one coming, barely. He stepped back as Galin&#39;s fist went in front of his face. Roketh raised his knee into Galin&#39;s mouth. Galin jumped back and attempted a kick. Roketh ducked and swung as hard as he could with his right fist. Galin, however, was quite fast. He ducked and bounced backwards, delivering a decent uppercut in the same instance. Roketh and Galin stood there, both off them holding their jaws. Galin nodded, as if to say he was impressed. Roketh slowly took his hand from his jaw. He began to contemplate how to defeat this monster. Before he could give it much more thought, Galin was charging again. Roketh flew into the air, Galin took off after him instantly.  The aerial battle begun. Both began swinging rapidly and dodging the same. Galin suddenly flipped in mid air. Roketh looked up only to see Galin&#39;s tail coming strait down. Roketh had no time to dodge. Galin&#39;s attack landed right in Roketh&#39;s face. The evil dragon sneered as Roketh plummeted towards the ground. With blinding speed Galin sped past the falling dragon. As soon as he reached the ground, he spring-boarded strait up. Roketh&#39;s fall was suddenly stopped as a knee was planted into his back. Roketh&#39;s face was one of sufferage. Galin then put his other knee into his back. Roketh rose into the air a little ways, but it was enough for Galin to spin around and put both feet into his back. Roketh found himself flying strait up. He caught his bearings and turned, but Galin was gone. His back was hurting horroribly. Then, the massive hand of Galin grasped Roketh&#39;s head from behind. Roketh struggled, but it was to no avail. <BR> <BR>&#34;You thought you had a chance? Ha!&#34; Galin jested as he grabbed Roketh&#39;s tail, &#34;Now you die like your comrades.&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin released his head, and pick Roketh into the air by his tail. Galin threw Roketh towards the ground with all his might. Roketh hit the ground and an instant crater was formed. He lay there, staring up at the dragon who mockingly hovered overhead. Roketh began to think about the Lords who had given their lives. Bloodlust, the golden Lord of Combat. Denemaur, the honorable Lord of Water. Azurian, the Lord of Darkness. Then, the images of Vyger appeared, then Jace. They were his friends, his only friends. He saw a flash of Vyger being destroied by Dragonaught&#39;s massive beam cannon. Then Jace, being incenerated by the flame of Nightmare. He became enraged at this point, Nightmare and Dragonaught were acting under Galin&#39;s orders. Roketh felt the anger boiling, like fire in his vains. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ha ha. This was quite ammusing. Though you really didn&#39;t put up a fight. Alas, I am forced to do this.&#34; Galin flew down and landed near the edge of the crater, &#34;Join us.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh flw out of the hole with all the wrath that had festered up within him. He punched Galin in the mouth with all his might. Galin stummbled back. Before he could react, he found a knee in his stomache. He bent over out of breathe. As he gasped, a massive fist landed in the back of his head. Galin hit the ground face first. Galin finally knew two feelings only those who opposed him knew, pain and fear. Suddenly, his neck was grasped by a massive hand. He was lifted into the air, he found himself staring into the eyes of Roketh. Roketh thought it was over, thought Galin could never fight again. Then, Galin kicked Roketh upside his head. Roketh dropped him and staggered, holding his head. Galin fell to one knee, holding his gut. He saw his opponent&#39;s predicament, and capitolized. Galin shot off his other leg and hurdeled strait for Roketh&#39;s legs. Roketh managed to see this coming in the nick of time. Roketh jumped as Galin darted under him. Roketh jumped on Galin&#39;s back. Galin was skimming the ground, but with roketh on his back he quickly found himself going down. Galin&#39;s face hit the ground and he then flipped forward. Roketh held on to his shoulders and found himself rolling under the weight of the other dragon. Roketh managed to flip off his right hand and land on his feet. He glanced up to see Galin laying there, still. The dragon was on his side, his back to Roketh. As Roketh circled him, he saw blood trickleing out of his mouth. Galin jumped to his feet, then wiped the blood from his mouth. <BR> <BR>&#34;Guess you don&#39;t want to join then. That means I have to kill you...&#34; Galin said as he smiled at Roketh, &#34;...good.&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin put his fist up in tight balls. He closed his eyes and began to glow a blue color. As his eyes opened, twin blue beams shot out. Roketh dodged the speedy blasts. They spun off into the distance. The explosion that ensued was uncanny. Ripples of blue energy surged around Galin. Roketh began to woner if he could defeat this fiend. Galin then let off a roar, an incredable roar. Lightning seemed to sweep out of his body, run around it, then return to his form. Then, he extended his arms, legs, and wings to their maximum size. A huge explosion seemed to errupt from the dragon himwelf. Roketh was hit with the force of the blast and flew backwards. He landed on his back and struggled to his feet. A huge crater was around Galin now. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am now at my most powerful stage. My strength is not the average warrior now. I am...a god.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh didn&#39;t even see the punch coming. He found himself flying upwards, a short distance into the air. Then a punch to his gut in the middle of the air sent him back a small bit, still air born. The only thing he really saw was the ankle of Galin&#39;s roundhouse speeding towards his head. The impact sent him flying to his left. He spun out of control now. He hit a wall of some sort. He fell to the ground and stood up. He had hit...Galin? Not the fact that he hit him, but the fact he hit him in the chest and he didn&#39;t even flinch. Galin stared down at Roketh as the dragon stood. <BR> <BR>&#34;Do you see? I am the most powerful being alive.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, he turned to the figure in the shadows. He stared at the fiend, for an eternity it seemed. He turned and hit Roketh in the mouth again. Roketh fell to the ground, it was then he realized that he was in the middle of a power struggle. He also remembered about the power of darkness he now had. He stood, and Galin looked back a bit startled. <BR> <BR>&#34;Do you mind?&#34; Galin said, &#34; I&#39;m in the middle of taking over my father&#39;s empire.&#34; He backhanded at Roketh as he returned his gaze to his father, who remained silent. His hand met resistance, a little too much. He turned to see his hand against the biggest scythe he had ever seen. Roketh was holdin it with one hand. <BR> <BR>&#34;No Galin, you die now.&#34; The voice from the shadows spoke. <BR> <BR>With blinding speed the beast lept from the shadows and knocked Roketh down. Roketh went dark at this point, into an unconscious state. When he awoke, the land was shreaded. he turned to see the Lost Elves woods in flames. The ground was litered with numerous craters and explosion holes. Then, Galin fell in front of him. galin stood quickly, only to have a shodowed figure swoop down and knock him over. Galin didn&#39;t look so good, and the shadow was to fast to be seen. As Galin landed on his back and looked up, a beam hit him in the chest with a massive explosion. Roketh stummbled back in shock. Someone or something was man-handleing Galin. Galin also had his claws out and was obviously fighting for all he was worth. The beast landed back in the shadows as Galin crawled from his hole. <BR> <BR>&#34;Forgive my defience master....please?&#34; Galin pleaded. <BR> <BR>&#34;I would my son, but you defied me, and you will do it again. I can not risk that.&#34; The shadow spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;No father, please!&#34;Galin tried to scream but it was to late. <BR> <BR>The massive hand of the shadowed figure raised into the air. The energy curled itself into a ball in the palm of the titanic creature. The entie ebony hand suddenly was yellow. Then, a beam of pure energy errupted from his hands. Roketh was standing a little ways a way. Galin caught the blast in the gut. That wasn&#39;t enough to stop it. The beam shot through his back and into the distance. The ray of light faded and disappeared. Galin stood there, confused and shocked. The fell to his knees, a gaping hole within his stomache. He tried to scream, but nothing would come out. The hand quickly conjured up another beam and shot at his chest. Galin could do nothing. The blast hit him in the chest and, as before, exploded out of his backside. Chips of his ribs and organs shot out and burned up in the beam. The energy faded yet again, leaving another hole in the monster. Roketh quickly capitolized. <BR> <BR>&#34;By the power of the Darkness,&#34; Roketh grabber his scythe with both hands, &#34;I set you....free.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that he swung, decapitating Galin. Galin&#39;s head flew off as small squirts of blood flew from his severed neck. He body fell forward limply. <BR> <BR>&#34;Very good, you may join me yet.&#34; The shadow spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;I think not. There is something I know that you don&#39;t...why did I kill him off so quickly?&#34; Roketh smiled before adding, &#34;By the powers of Darkness, I can ressurect creatures that I kill myself.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, he slammed the non-bladed end into the ground. It cracked, and black demonic spirits arose. Galin&#39;s bodt began to glow red. Then, there was a flash of light. The demons left, the crack was gone, and Galin stood there in awe. <BR> <BR>&#34;Was I...dead?&#34; Galin asked in disbelief, &#34;You saved me from damnation. I owe you much.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;The only thing you owe me is help in killing this monster.&#34; Roketh said as looked towards the shadows. Galin soon did the same. <BR> <BR>The evil being in the shadows didn&#39;t even flinch at this turn of events as he said, &#34;So be it traitor, you die again with you new comrade.&#34; <BR> <BR>Has Galin truly allied with the Lord of the 8 Lords? Can their combined strength over come the massive power of Kingston, Lord of Death and the most powerful Villin of the Vile Lords? Stay tuned. <BR> <BR> <BR>P.S. Hope B.R. liked the brief bone and organ scene.

 Great chapter CHB, I really like the overall feel of this entire story...Galin&#39;s resurrection was a great touch. That, I did not expect.
