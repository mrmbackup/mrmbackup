 Chapter 24: Perpetual Fluidity <BR> <BR> <BR>StoneClaw could barely hear the durahan&#39;s shouting through the maelstrom of plasma bolts and gun fire exploding through corridors around them, it seemed the security hadn&#39;t stayed off as long as they&#39;d hoped. Gun turrets, cleverly hidden within the walls and floor had suddenly opened fire, shortly after the tower was racked from yet another explosion. Moo barreled forward, the dark one mowing down the defenses in a fury of razor sharp talons and dragons fire. Justice struggled to keep up, a sign of his age perhaps as bullets bounced off his armored form. Claw lagged behind, the slowest of the three, trying desperately to ignore the sheering pain of a plasma blast to his shoulder. Pieces of stone skin flaked off to reveal tender, bleeding muscle tissue beneath. Nevertheless, the trio continued forward...running the gauntlet to face their enemy..... <BR> <BR>Suddenly a turret descended from the ceiling and issued a single blast. Justice dropped to the floor, his steel body landing with a crash as the deadly bolt sailed over him. StoneClaw moved to the side, nearly getting hit himself and destroyed the turret with a quick energy shot, causing it to erupt into a ball of fire. As the smell of burning electronics filled the air Claw and Justice realized that Moo was long gone, the dragon had left them behind... <BR> <BR>&#34;W-Where..did he go?&#34;Justice muttered wearily as Claw helped him up. The light that served as the durahan&#39;s eye seemed to waver and flicker slightly. His steel body was writhe with scars and deep cuts, burn marks and spots that were half melted...&#34;Curse him! Come...We&#39;ve got to...catch up.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Catch your breath first old man,&#34;The Trident hissed, glancing about the halls. The sound of gunfire was now growing distant, but it remained none the less. &#34;Rest here for a bit. I&#39;ll find Moo and we&#39;ll-&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No! I have not come all this way for nothing!!&#34;Justice yelled as he stood up shakingly, leaning on the wall for support.&#34;I will avenge my trainer...if it is the last thing I-.&#34; <BR> <BR>Justice stopped in mid sentence as the wall he leaned upon began to move. It opened suddenly and the durahan fell into the abyss as Claw looked on, unable to catch him in time. Just as the trident was considering going in the wall behind him also shifted. Something powerful gripped his tail and with one great pull, dragged him into the darkness as well... <BR> <BR> <BR>It wasn&#39;t a terribly long fall; but tumbling into the black, unknown depths of the tower seemed to last an eternity. Finally Stoneclaw reached the bottom, his rock clad form slamming hard as water surged around him, suddenly filling his mouth and nostrils. Rising up to avoid drowning Claw gazed about his surroundings and found himself in what looked like an underground river. A natural tunnel of limestone, dimly lit by various bulbs strung up along the ceiling. Many were blinking and nearly shorted out, seeming to cast Erie shadows across the surface of the surrounding rock.. The murky waters beneath reached nearly to the Tridents midsection, flowing slowly through the darkened cavern, cloaked with a light mist. Claw gazed to his left, seeing what appeared to be a lift of some kind, obviously he had fallen below even the dark tower...into the islands interior. It was then that the foul scent invaded his nostrils, a rancid smell of death...as if something had been left to rot down here for a very long time. He realized it was rising from the greenish water...  <BR> <BR>At this time Claw was far less concerned about how he was dragged down here, in fact the Trident had a mind to use that lift...Then, a distant sound caused him to forget that idea, attention refocused on certain danger. To him it sounded like a huge tidal wave, and it was approaching too quickly. The cavern began to tremble as a surge of water barreled through, filling the tunnel entirely. Stoneclaw was left with only a moment to react, ramming his talons into the rock beneath him as deeply as he could...... <BR> <BR>The wave struck with more force then Claw had felt from any attack he&#39;d ever suffered, yet he held on. He held firm as the natures fury washed over him, battering him with the same might that had shaped the cavern around him. The water was salty, it burned his wounds like hell fire, threatened to chip away his stone skin. The waves power dragged him several feet, even as his talons remained firmly imbedded in the floor. Soon the aching in his lungs began, deprived of oxygen. Claw chanced raising his head for air but wound up inhaling more water then anything else. The putrid liquid burned his throat, the pounding in his lungs worsening... <BR> <BR>Finally...the wave passed...and the waters subsided to only about two feet. Stoneclaw hacked and coughed, drawing in much needed air as his wide chest heaved. He glanced down at his talons to find several broken and bleeding and he realized that the ordeal had pushed him over twenty feet away from his previous location. Strangely the lights were still up although many bulbs were broken. Stranger still...the greenish water had turned crystal clear. That wasn&#39;t a normal occurrence he hoped, knowing another might kill him. He&#39;d no idea that the true answer was far worse...Another sound echoed through the tunnels that made the Trident&#39;s stomach churn. That laugh...that dumb, blank laughter wreaking of stupidity and almost childish glee mixed with a good amount of malevolence. <BR> <BR>&#34;Liqua...&#34;Claw muttered with a sharp hiss. It had been sometime since they&#39;d faced that murderous Aqua cutter. But that was in the dryad forest with allies helping. This was Liqua&#39;s element and Stoneclaw had no one to aid him this time...&#34;Quit hiding. This games over...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hahahaha, game just beginning liqua thinks.&#34;The voice seemed to echo from everywhere...&#34;Liqua remembers you...you and furry hare and metal man. You hurt Liqua...Now...his turn to bring pain!&#34; <BR> <BR>At those words a huge hand made of water rose up and sped toward Stoneclaw, slamming him into the cavern wall. Before Claw could slide back down another giant fist of H2o emerged and struck him, forcing the trident six full inches into the wall with it&#39;s strength. Claw was brutally reminded of his battle with Flood at this point but was given no chance to fight back. The hand grabbed him and thrust him into the river face down. Holding his breath was StoneClaw&#39;s only option as he struggled to break free. Somehow the arena warrior wriggled free of the grasp and rose from the waters once again, more then alittle pissed off. The fist of water attacked only to explode under the power of his energy shots. More liquid hands emerged, each one destroyed with a well aimed blast. Soon the cavern was filling with the steam of evaporated water and the assault stopped... <BR> <BR>&#34;Ooooh you real tough! Beat up river! Hahahaha...&#34;Liqua laughed from where ever he&#39;d hidden himself. <BR> <BR>Stoneclaw snarled and slashed at the water below. &#34;Come out and fight me without your that fake power the Masters given you!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Master attack not fake...&#34;Liqua&#39;s voice said as a surge of water erupted under Claw, enveloping him. Suddenly the Trident found himself encased in a bubble of water. He thrashed violently but the bubble shifted constantly, ensuring that he couldn&#39;t escape. Liqua revealed himself then, rising out of the river as though he was part of it, his clear form melding with it perfectly. &#34;It very real...see. Hahahaha!&#34; Laughing, the Aqua cutter settled back to watch Claw drown before his eyes... <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#34;This is wrong...&#34;Shielka muttered to Ganthor as they journeyed through the underground river. The Daina was forced to walk as the huge Stronghorn had to keep his head down to avoid hitting his horn on the ceiling. She actively tried to retrace her steps to figure out just were they went wrong, recalling her memories of serving on this ship which in truth was less then a week ago. &#34;Wrong...and I was so sure that was the correct lift. I keep forgetting how different this place is in stationary mode.&#34; Shielka stopped in her tracks. &#34;Lets go back.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Can&#39;t do that...&#34;Ganthor said as he walked right on passed her. The daina looked at him confused and quickly caught up. <BR> <BR>&#34;And why is that? This is the wrong way...&#34;She said but had a feeling her words feel on deaf golem ears. <BR> <BR>&#34;Cause we passed the point of &#39;no return&#39;, know what I&#39;m sayin?&#34;Ganthor said and got another baffled look and proceeded to explain. &#34;Goes like this, your tryin to get somewhere right? Well point of no return is where it takes longer to go back then to keep on going to your destination. Some intellectual type thought of that ya know?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That makes no sense...&#34;Shiekla replied. &#34;You don&#39;t know how far it is to the masters chamber. So how do you know where the point of no return is?? Wait, don&#39;t answer that...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I knows cause.....you hear that?&#34;Ganthor asked and she heard it as well, a familiar laughter. &#34;Who&#39;s that?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I know that laugh...come on!&#34;Shielka bolted down the tunnel, the stronghorn following as best he could... <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>He was drowning, that simple fact echoed long in Stoneclaw&#39;s mind...even after he&#39;d lost the energy to struggle against the oncoming darkness. Every once in a while the horrid aching in his chest forced the Trident to fight again to escape, only to fail miserably. Each outburst stole more of his rapidly depleting energy, bringing him that much closer to oblivion. Worse of all was Liqua...he could still make out the Cutter&#39;s outline through his narrowing vision, taunting, laughing. Death wasn&#39;t something a monster of the arena feared...perhaps it was finally time to embrace it, at least he would die in battle. Finally, lack of air and exhaustion took there toll and the Trident blacked out... <BR> <BR>A few minutes later the unexpected happened...he woke up. Stoneclaw opened his eyes, violently spitting up the water that had invaded his lungs. He was propped against the side of the natural wall, the lower half of his body emerged in water. Ganthor and Shielka stood over him protectively, Liqua was nowhere in sight. The stronghorn had his hand pressed to the tridents chest, forcing the water from him. At this point Claw had had enough H2o to last three lifetimes. <BR> <BR>&#34;He&#39;s coming around. You saved him Ganthor!&#34;Shielka beamed.&#34;Don&#39;t worry about Liqua...He ran off after I blasted him. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s dumb enough to attack again, not with us together.&#34; <BR> <BR>Claw was about to respond when Liqua&#39;s laughter erupted once again...along with several Aqua cutters. Dozens of the creatures arose but the trio could easily see they were constructs of water by their rippling surfaces. Nonetheless, their talons looked deadly enough and Stoneclaw although weakened, stood up to face them. <BR> <BR>&#34;Guess he&#39;s even dumber then you thought...&#34;Claw hissed, &#34;Lets slaughter em...&#34; <BR> <BR>The other two monsters nodded in agreement as the battle began. Ganthor wielding fought well considering he could move much, smashing the cutters into oblivion. Shielka fought with energy attacks while Claw waded in with slashes from his talons. The cutters shattered easily, usually with only one strike, exploding into a spray of water. Still, they couldn&#39;t fight forever as a seemingly endless number arose. Stoneclaw realized Liqua was smarter then most gave him credit for. No matter how many they destroyed the fact remained...they were beating up a river.  <BR> <BR>But liqua had gotten careless, standing at the rear of his army laughing his empty head off. Stoneclaw hissed, still tasting the salty water in his mouth, feeling burn his throat. The Trident charged forward with all the ferocity that had made him feared. The cutters fell like dominos before the wraith of his talons, like leaves in the wind they were cast aside. Liqua didn&#39;t even realize he&#39;d been spotted until talons had racked across his face. He stopped laughing then... <BR> <BR>&#34;Liqua will kill!&#34;The cutter lunged forward, slashing the tridents armored chest to no avail. Stoneclaw grinned wickedly before giving Liqua another mocking blow to the face. The Aqua countered with a tail strike. Claw caught his tail, digging his talon&#39;s in for a firm grip before using his golemlike strength to hurl Liqua into a wall. Not letting go he slammed his enemy into the opposite wall before throwing him down the tunnel....Liqua rolled for awhile before landing facedown in the mud, his creations disappearing, returning to the river. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ganthor! Shielka! There&#39;s a lift down there, get on it!&#34;Claw pointed toward the lift he&#39;d seen before. <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you insane? We can&#39;t-&#34;The daina protested. <BR> <BR>&#34;Just do it!&#34;Stoneclaw hissed, determination in his eyes. He was going to beat Liqua by himself...&#34;I&#39;ll follow you, after I deal with this one...&#34; Reluctantly both monsters proceeded down to the lift and Claw turned his attention back to liqua who had just gotten up. A few moments ago he&#39;d realized that his best weapon had been above them all along... <BR> <BR>&#34;You can&#39;t beat Liqua! He is powerful!&#34;The Aqua cutter snarled as Stoneclaw reached up and ripped the power cable from the ceiling. Most of the lights went out at this point. It seemed as though only three things still existed, the two naga&#39;s and the sparking cable...&#34;You not use that! You die too!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Um...&#34;Stoneclaw hissed, tapping his rocky hide.&#34;Stone doesn&#39;t conduct electricity...&#34; <BR> <BR>Before claw could use it Liqua charged, snatching the cable and knocking him backward into the water and pinning him there. The Aqua noticed a large patch of the Tridents armor blasted away around the shoulder area. <BR> <BR>&#34;No stone there! Hahahahahaha!&#34;With sadistic glee Liqua lowered the cable to the patch of bare flesh. Suddenly Claw lashed his tail upward, tipping his body weight, flipping Liqua over him. With Cable inhand the Aqua cutter seemed to stay suspended in mid-air before crashing into the water. The scream that followed echoed throughout the tower. Claw had focused on getting his injured torso out of the water before turning around to see electricity coarsing through the Aqua&#39;s body, lighting him up like a Christmas tree. The scream, the anguished wail continued and Stoneclaw knew he&#39;d remember this scene of burning flesh for the rest of his life. Finally, the charred body collapsed into the river and floated peacefully. The corpse twitched now and again from the electrified water but their was little doubt he was dead. With the stench of scorched naga filling the air Claw left to rejoin the others... <BR> <BR>That is until razor sharp teeth clamped down hard on his shoulder. Liqua wasn&#39;t as dead as one would have thought. Furious, Stoneclaw gored the cutters left eye until he realised his grip. Then he turned around, his 5 inch talons extending to their full length and attacked, each blow forcing Liqua backward... <BR> <BR>&#34;Why &#42;Slash&#42; won&#39;t &#42;Slash&#42; you &#42;Slash&#42; Die!?&#34;Was asked before the final blow was rendered. The Aqua cutter staggered backward, it&#39;s charred body covered with cuts, blood pouring from gaping wounds. A sickening gurgling sound it made before crashing back against a wall...defeated at last. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#34;He&#39;s here...&#34;Justice thought as he entered the dark chamber. He knew not where he was, only that his arch enemy was very near. As if he could sense the presence of that which he hated...Vor. Suddenly the room was illuminated to reveal an arena of sorts. A large, circular room...the center a pit filled with acid, grinding machines to the far right and left. No doubt various other contraptions had been put in place. Vor, the crimson warrior stood upon a great pedestal. He leap of his perch with a flip so graceful you hardly think any durahan type capable of it. Landing ten feet away from Justice he stood and slowly drew the blood saber. <BR> <BR>&#34;Welcome...are you ready for me old man?&#34;Vor asked mockingly. Justice made no reply...finally, the moment of vengeance was a hand... <BR> <BR> <BR>To Be Continued....

 I have to agree, Torey.  BR&#39;s writing has comea  long ways &#40;as you can tell by the previous chapters&#41;, and has evolved into a HIGHLY enjoyable epic.  The Illiad and Oddysey of MR, if you will ^_^ <BR> <BR>I did notice a couple errors in grammar, but by now, you know what you&#39;re doing, so I&#39;ll let you find them on your own.  Also, they didn&#39;t detract from the story too much. Although, there was a small scene where I was thrust back to reality to decipher which word went in the sentence. Still, I can hardly wait fo the final two chapters ^_^

 Yes, I will admit that to be one flaw. I was a little confused by a word that seemed to come out of nowhere and relate to the same notingness. Then, I realized you probably tried to delete a sentence and merely missed a word. Other than that, a great new addition. Master&#39;s minons are dropping like flys, too.
