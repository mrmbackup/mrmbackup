 Chapter 5: The Golem Village <BR> <BR>	Nobody spoke.  Nobody wanted to speak.  Scaler was barely dragging himself along.  He was past crying, he was in shock. Baxter was walking grimly, not as hurt as everyone else &#40;Minion and Baxter’s family warred a long time ago&#41;, but he didn’t know Minion’s possible death could be this devastating to his friends, so he felt bad too.  Gengen was shedding tears.  Big Bob hadn’t stopped crying, he felt it was his fault for being stupid.  Deed was hurt to see Scaler this way, and he was hugged by everyone for saving him.  Zimbo was trying to comfort everyone, he knew what it was like to lose a dear one.  &#40;Refer to chapter 2 if you don’t know what I’m talking about.&#41;  Hanger felt the worst, maybe a little better then Scaler, but he knew that something was wrong with Katuum.  Suddenly, they saw a pure Golem attending to his cornfield on the outskirts of town.  The group picked up their pace, and rushed toward the hospital.  The houses in the dusty town were empty, Hanger noticed, and the only Golem they saw &#40;other than Big Bob&#41; was the farmer Golem in the outskirts of town.  When they passed City Hall, they saw a huge crowd of monsters.  The whole town was there!  That was not good, because the hospital is right next to City Hall. <BR>	“Out of the way, people,” Scaler called, but no one listened. <BR>	“Did you hear?  Out of the way!” Gengen called. <BR>	“OUT OF THE WAY!” Big Bob yelled, but no one listened. <BR>	Baxter didn’t like Minion, but this was just insane.  A hurt monster, near death, and no one would move.  “GET OUT OF THE WAY!!!” he screamed.  “IF I HAVE TO SAY THAT ONE MORE FREAKEN’ TIME, SOMEONE IS GONNA PAY!!!” <BR>	“Oooh, I’m scared,” said a smart-<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> Dao.  That was just not a good choice to make. <BR>	“YOU ANNOYING LITTLE PIG!  &#40;BEEP!&#41; &#40;BEEP!&#41; &#40;BEEP!&#41; &#40;BEEP!&#41; &#40;BEEP!&#41; &#40;BEEP!&#41; &#40;BEEP!&#41; &#40;BEEP!&#41; &#40;BEEP!&#41;   &#40;BEEP!&#41;  &#40;He used some language I won’t repeat.&#41;  YOU ARE A PESKY LITTLE FLY!!!  OH, YES, YOU ARE A FLY, AND I KNOW HOW TO KILL FLIES! FLYSWATTER ATTACK!” <BR>	And with that, he turned into a Flyswatter, like the Flyswatter attack does, but this was a HUGE Flyswatter.  I mean it.  It was maybe four to five stories tall, and Golems that saw it told the story to their grand kids, who didn’t believe them.  Anyway, it smacked the Golem, making a 40-foot hole in the ground.  Everyone got out of their way.  “Thank you,” Baxter said pleasantly.  “Is there a doctor or nurse in the house?” <BR>	Twenty Golems immediately stepped up.  “Okay, this monster needs medical care.  NOW!!” The Golems went to work, but a large Golem stepped forward.  “The cost is 30,000 Gold.  If you don’t got da money, you don’t got the treatment.” <BR>	They scraped up money from everyone’s savings, and they had left over: 1 Gold.  The Golems went to work on Minion, and Scaler started asking questions.  “Hanger, how the hell did you know that Katuum was going to Minion’s tent?” <BR>	“Well, you see, Katuum talked with the same slang as the three Katos that Minion killed, his eyes burned with hatred every time Minion was around, and he was scruffy and smelled like the Katos.  First I thought I must be imagining things, then I thought he might be from the same area, and at last my suspicions were confirmed,” Hanger answered nervously. <BR>	“Okay. Next question.  Deed, you hate Minion, and Minion hates you, so why did you save him?”  <BR>	“I never said I hated him.  I-I-I just didn’t want you to be sad, so I saved him.” <BR>	The group went quiet as the truth dawned on them.  “Okay,” Scaler said.  “Now to ask the big one.”  He turned to the nearest Golem, a Big Blue &#40;Golem/Tiger.&#41;  “Why the crowd?” Scaler asked.   <BR>	The Big Blue kept glancing nervously at Baxter.  “Well, the mayor died of a heart attack this gray and dreadful morning, and any Golem-even your friend-may run for mayor.” <BR>	Gengen looked at the one gold coin that was the only money they had, and he had an idea.  He took Big Bob and went into the corner, speaking with him.  “I have an idea,” he told his friends.  “I’m going to train this here Golem in Intelligence.” <BR>	“That is a very good idea,” Scaler said. “However, we have no ranch, and cannot afford one.” <BR>	“I know of a Jell trainer near these parts,” Big Bob said &#40;Yes, that’s me!&#41;  “He will assist Gengen in training me.  You guys stay here.  We will be back in a month.” <BR>	And so Big Bob and Gengen traveled to a city, where people looked at them and shouted “Where are your masters?”When they finally got to a large house and stable, they looked in the window of the house.  A woman noticed them &#40;Colt&#41; and let them inside.  There were a lot of people there, and they introduced themselves.  “Always nice to see Jells in here.  I’m Luka, but you have to call me JellTrainer.  These are my friends, stupid, Wheel Gator, Francisco Rodriguez &#40;did I spell that right?&#41; Bloodshed, and RNA, and The Man. &#40;If I didn’t include you, don’t be mad.  I chose a limited amount of people.&#41;  That talking lion over there is named Celious,  and that smart eagle you see over there is called Eagle Fierce.  Eagle has been watching you lately, so I knew you were going to come,” JellTrainer said politely.   <BR>	“We want-” Gengen started. <BR>	“We know what you want, you want to train him in INT!  Did you even listen to Jell? He-” <BR>	“Colt,” JellTrainer said. <BR>	“Yeah?” Colt asked <BR>	“Shut up and go away.” <BR>	“Yes, sir.” <BR>	Everyone in the room clapped.  “It’s about time,” Celious grumbled. “Now, with the help of my fried chickens-er, I mean friends,&#40;Bloodshed and stupid kick him in the butt.&#41;  Ow!  I was just joking, jeez!  Anyway, with the help of my friends, we can get you 300 points smarter in a week!   After that we can’t help, we have the Major 4 battles coming up.  You’d better work up an appetite, Celious cooked!  And you want to fill up on his cooking! &#40;I remember that gross chat room incident, don’t you?  When I tried to eat Celious by accident?  EWWWWW!&#41; Let’s start!” <BR>	So they trained and trained and trained, then finally, Big Bob got to taste Celious’ orange chicken.  After a week, Big Bob felt much smarter.  “E=MC squared,” he recited.  So they went back to Golem Village, but before they went, The Man, RNA, Francisco, and Wheel Gator approached them. “We got a present for you, Gengen, for doing this,” they said, and handed him a permit! 	 <BR>	“YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!”  he yelled. “No Dark Temple for us!!!!” <BR>	So they went back and had the election.  Big Bob made the top three.  With 30 seconds left to vote, Minion woke up and first everyone made him vote for Big Bob, then came the hugging and happiness.  Then, Big Bob.......won the election by 1 vote!!!  As everyone was celebrating, Gengen thought this would be a good time to show the permit.  He showed it to everyone, and there was a stunned silence.  “YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!” Minion shouted from his wheelchair.  “HA HA! This is no doubt the greatest day of our journey yet!” <BR>	The first thing Big Bob had to do was give a speech, then he whipped them all into the Rock House &#40;like the White House&#41; and gave them 50,000 Gold.  “I can afford it,” he said.  So the Jells continue their great journey to defeat the evil Burner, and hopefully, they will finish it.   <BR> <BR>Author’s note: I think that my stories are getting better, but I will admit this one got a bit sidetracked.  The part of the story about people was not to make anyone feel bad, I like  you all.  Everyone who was not mentioned will probably feel bad, but I think that these people mentioned have done me many things.  That part of the story was made so I could thank them the way I know how.    I respect and follow them, hoping to retrace their steps.  Just because I didn’t mention you, doesn’t mean you should be mad at me.  So if I get one post saying “Hey, why didn’t you include me?” I swear I will  kill you.  Thank you, all of your stories and comments are always welcome and respected, I like almost all of you here, I just didn’t include you. See ya in the next chapter!  <BR> <BR>Chapter 6: Dead Information <BR> <BR> <BR>	“We need to make up a song that we sing in battle.  You know what I’m talking about.  Like a war cry.”  Scaler was trying to convince the rest of the group. <BR>	“Okay, chill,” Gengen said, laughing.  “We’ll think of something.” <BR>	“And we are NOT going to sleep without a good song,” Scaler said firmly. <BR>	Everyone laughed.  Scaler was the organized type of guy, so when he read a book where the heroes had a war song, he wanted one too. For hours the Jells tried to think up a song, and they were having fun. <BR>	“How come Deed gets to sleep and we don’t?  He’s in the group too!” Minion complained. <BR>	“Think up a song and we can sleep, okay?  And stop whining.  Deed is his pet, you are never gonna win this one,” Baxter said grumpily. <BR>	Minion wanted to sleep so bad, but he could not because of the song thing, and he remembered a Dana Carvey song &#40;for those of you who don’t know who Dana Carvey is...I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU DON’T KNOW WHO DANA CARVEY IS!!!&#41;  So Minion sang it “Dead dog lying in a ditch, cigarette smoker has an itch!” <BR>	Everyone hated it, but from then on, that was their war battle cry.  Anyway, weeks later, they got to the big gates.  The Durahans were busy packing up their supplies.  “Uh, hello?” Minion called out. <BR>	“Oh! I forgot about you people,” the big Durahan said.  “So, where is your permit?  Or do you have one?” <BR>	Gengen flashed the permit, and the Durahans opened the gate.  But Minion stopped. <BR>	“And you are packing up because...” <BR>	“We are packing up because we don’t want to fight with the 10th troop.  If you were smart, you would stop your journey right now and go home.  We may be the Mighty Fifteen Durahans, but we cannot even dream of beating the tenth troop,” the large Durahan answered. <BR>Suddenly, Hanger noticed something that all the others had missed.  “I see only fourteen Durahans,” he said suspiciously.   “You are missing one.” <BR>	Suddenly, the large Durahan looked very afraid.  “Where is FireSheild?  Please don’t say the teller was right!”  <BR>	“What teller?” Baxter asked. <BR>	“Two days ago, a fortune teller came by and told us ‘The leader of the troop is among you.  Do not trust, or you will feed his lust for blood. He is evil, and you will never live against him.  She was talking about the Garuda, FireShield.  I’m sorry, but we have to go,” he said, sounding scared. “Should have listened, should have listened.” <BR>	“They may leave, but we go on.  At least I do.  Anyone want to say something?” <BR>	“Yeah,” Baxter stepped up angrily, “I have something to say.  I say, none of us thought this would be serious, okay?  We thought that we would give up after a day or so.  But instead, you are over here willing to risk our lives fighting in a war we can’t hope to win.  Mr. Freeze’s death made me scared this was serious, and I realize how tough the worst squad is.  Now you want us to go and fight a the lowest troop in which the strongest monsters in both FIMBA an IMa couldn’t defeat.  And we stand no chance, and I’m sure I will not get out of this alive.  So, call me coward, but I am saving my own skin, and I’m going home.  You all think you are being brave, but in fact the word for this is ‘stupid.’  You all think I am a coward, but it is in fact ‘smart.’  I know I am the quiet, naive one, the young one, the dumb one, the one big-shot Minion hates, but I am entitled to whatever I want.  I’m going home, and nothing in this world can change that.” <BR>	Baxter made a huge impact on his speech, and gained much respect for it. You must think he is a chicken, but I doubt YOU would have even gone on this trip.  It takes a lot of guts to say things like that, belive me, I know.   <BR>	Minion seemed taken aback.  “You are both right and wrong, we need to save ourselves, yet, you NEVER give up.  EVER.  I didn’t really like you, but I respect you for going through all this with us.  But-” <BR>	He was interrupted when a Prince Hare runner came by.  What armies did was they sent out Hares to check up on things, then ran back to tell them.  “Muse Villige report in,” the Hare said breathlessly.  The Jells all leaned in, for, you guessed it, they came from Muse!  Anyway, the Hare was looking sad.  “Muse has been burned down by Burner’s army.” <BR>	The Jells all jumped up, and the large Durahan asked the question that was on everyone’s mind.  “Can you tell me the number of survivors, please?” he asked. <BR>	The Hare looked down at the ground and didn’t answer.  “Haaree, please tell me the number of survivors,” the Durahan asked again. <BR>	“Zero, sir,” he said sadly. <BR>	“No,no. It is impossible!” Baxter, Gengen, Minion, and Scaler were crying. <BR>	Suddenly,  Baxter looked older.  “Never mind what I said, let’s get this bitch.” <BR> <BR>	So they continued thier journey with the large Durahan named Trojan joining them.  Two weeks later, they heard shouting in the brush.  “But you can’t leave me.  I can’t survive alone!” one voice was shouting.  “I must.  I must recover myself, it is my way of dying,” an old and intelligent Phoenix’s voice rang out.  Gengen looked in, and there was a young Priarocks arguing with an old Phoenix.  “Hello,” Gengen said, for he knew there was only one evil Phoenix, and that was the one in Burner.   <BR>	“Why, hello there.” the Phoenix said. <BR>	Then the Priarocks expalained that he wanted to kill Burner, but the old Phoenix was past his time.  So Gengen suggested that he join the group, and Scorpio the Priarocks agreed.  <BR>	So they got a new comrade, and they continued walking.  One night Hanger snuck into Minion’s tent and told him “I don’t like the look in Scaler’s eyes.  It looks like-you know.  The Bloodlust is coming when he sees the tenth troop.  That is not good.” <BR>	Minion looked scared for his friend, for once the Bloodlust is triggered, you are invincable, but you die.  Something inside snaps.  There is a cure that has happened once in the history of the world.  No one knows what triggers it.   <BR>	“Well, we cannot stop the Bloodlust, we can only hope that it is not the Bloodlust, only anger.  However, we can find out if it is only anger or not.  If we cut him and he bleeds black,” Minion said. “And I have an idea how.” <BR>	So he woke up Deed and told him his plan.  Then they all went to sleep. <BR> <BR>	The next morning Scaler woke up to find himself bleeding, and a bite mark on his shoulder, and Deed standing there looking hungry.  “I kept calling you to give me breakfast, but you wouldn’t wake up, so I bit you.  I’m sorry!” <BR>	“That’s okay, Deed,” Scaler answered.  “I’ll just go to Minion’s tent to get it wrapped up.  And here is your breakfast.” <BR>	So he walked into Minion’s tent just as Minion was walking out.  “Hey, Minion, can I use your First Aid Kit?” Scaler asked. <BR>	Sure, sure,” Minion said sleepily. Then he remembered the plan and quickly glanced at the blood on Scaler’s shoulder.  It was jet black. <BR> <BR> <BR>What will happen next in the Journey of the Jells.  Who knows?  I don’t even know!  We’ll find out...
