&#34;Thanks again, Chase.&#34; <BR>        	&#34;Not a problem.  I&#39;m just glad they haven&#39;t figured out who flies that thing yet,&#34; Chase said, pointing his thumb back at the Odd Duck.  &#34;If they had, my &#39;legitimate&#39; shipping business would be over in a heartbeat!&#34;  Chase snorted a brief laugh.  &#34;Hell, far as they know, I&#39;m a perfect little citizen from Coruscant.  Pay all my taxes on time and everything.  Sh&#42;&#42;, I&#39;ve even  <BR>been hit by that bastard in the Odd Duck a couple times, costs me a fortune!&#34; <BR>	Jericho and the Rebel officer had a laugh and shook hands one last time as Chase turned to head back to the Odd Duck. <BR>	        &#34;You bandits ready to go?&#34; Chase yelled out to his crew.  It was a short stay on Yavin 4, but  <BR>once the group left, it was off to Bespin for awhile, where they were going to have a little time off. <BR> 	       &#34;Thank God,&#34; Chase thought to himself.  &#34;I NEED a break... and Dan&#39;Tiree and I haven&#39;t had any real time alone in almost a month.  I can tell it&#39;s bugging her too... but we&#39;re almost there, love.  Then I&#39;m yours alone for a month.&#34; <BR>	        &#34;Unless the fuzzball and his lover have an objection, we are,&#34; the dark-haired lady said.  <BR>Dan&#39;Tiree looked rather stunning for a lady who had worked her way from foot-soldier to Lieutenant for the Rebel Alliance in only 4-1/2 years... and for a lady who could effortlessly rip a man&#39;s throat out if he did the wrong thing or worked for the wrong people. <BR>        	The Ewok tried to kick Dan&#39;Tiree in the shin, but the lady dodged the fuzzy foot before cuffing the Ewok across the back of the head. <BR>	        &#34;C&#39;mon you two.  Save it for Bespin.  We&#39;ll have a month for that later,&#34; Chase said, noticing  <BR>Dan&#39;Tiree raising an eyebrow at him after that comment.  &#34;Or for other things,&#34; Chase quickly amended, blushing slightly before returning the subtle grin Dan&#39;Tiree had sent him after he had corrected himself. <BR>        	The crew all piled into the Odd Duck, taking their positions.  Chase sat in the pilot&#39;s seat,  <BR>Bob in the co-pilot&#39;s spot.  Dan&#39;Tiree sat at the navigation computer behind Chase.  Yana, the jawa, smooched Bob &#40;as Chase averted his eyes&#41; before heading off to the engineering bay with Gramps, the Assassin Droid.  The Ex-Stormtrooper sat up in the cockpit area with the  <BR>rest of the group. <BR>	        &#34;Ever been to Bespin, Dion?&#34;  The smuggler asked the former Imperial soldier. <BR>        	&#34;Nope.  You?&#34; <BR>	        &#34;Just once.  Hope Lando&#39;s still in charge out there in Cloud City!&#34; <BR>	        &#34;Calrissian?&#34;  Dion and Dan&#39;Tiree both squeaked in alarm. <BR>        	&#34;Yep.  Old friend of mine,&#34; Chase grinned as the ship took off. <BR>	         The Odd Duck left Yavin 4, then the Yavin system altogether.  As soon as they were clear of  <BR>the Rebel patrols, the Odd Duck tore into hyperspace, headed for Bespin. <BR>
