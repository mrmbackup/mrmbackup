 In a land ravaged by centuries of war, man and monster alike must combine their own forces to survive. <BR>     In this new land, armies rise and are destroied overnight and hundreds of these armies roam the lands and seas, each hoping to destroy the other in order to bring the world under their rule in a new world order defined by each armies own &#34;laws.&#34; <BR>     In this land that is 1/2 land,1/4 rivers, and 1/4 ocean, magic thrives within men and monsters. <BR>      In this land beggars and thieves plunder what they can before being executed. <BR>     In this land rain falls to the ground only a couple more inches a year in some places than the blood that is spilled. <BR>     In the land everyone is in an army, a kingdom&#39;s army, or they are beggars or thieves. <BR>     In the land, a general by the name of X-Blitz rules 1/4 of the land with his &#34;Black Death&#34; army. <BR>     In the land monsters and men are sometimes mass-produced....just to go to war. <BR>     In this land Darkness and the Dark Army will ise from the ashes of fallen armies, natural upheavals, mourning families, ravaged kingdoms, the last remains of the thieving community, lost seapirates, wild monsters, and watever else they can get. <BR>     And in this land The Dark Army will thrive and stand to do battle day after day, trying to unite all armies under their banner to make peace. <BR>     So begins the war. <BR> <BR>     I know its short, but my other chapters will be longer, which is why i put it in epics.

 Needs some serious working issues. <BR> <BR>Needs to be longer in for the Epics section, not going to grasp anyone&#39;s attention with such short chapters. <BR> <BR>Need to break up into paragraphs, to make the action easier to follow. <BR> <BR>Seeing that it is the Prologue, I&#39;m not holding much against it, but when you write a Prologue it needs to nail your intended reader&#39;s attention, and it failed to get me wanting to read the next chapters. <BR> <BR>Of course, I really did like the set up you were gunning for. With a few mechanical upgrades &#40;that will come with practice&#41; I&#39;m sure you could work the atmosphere abundantly.

 to indent, just read the Formatting toolbar to the left, and do what it says.

 Thanx for the tip, but i forgot another important question about length: <BR> <BR>how long is one chapter of an epic when handwritten,usually?

 Depends on the size of your handwriting, and don&#39;t worry about indenting the stuff you post online, no one else does. <BR> <BR>As far as grabbing attention, start something you are strong with. If you are a relatively new arthor, then you still might have to feel things out and gauge what you are good at. <BR> <BR>Me? I don&#39;t like to brag, but I was told early on that my fight sequences were top notch. I can visualize and describe combat very well, possibly from my extreme desire to fight. &#40;Competition style that is. Freestyle Combat tournaments, Regulation Boxing, UFC, Kickboxing, etc.&#41; I love to fight. <BR> <BR>Whatever it is, I&#39;m really good at getting nitty gritty with action, but I wasn&#39;t always so talented. I didn&#39;t just start writing well, by a long shot. My first epic was back at B. Campbell&#39;s old board, where I had two. That was...1998-99? <BR> <BR>Regardless, I sucked. Worse than any of you could imagine, but it didn&#39;t hamper my lack of motivation, and I loved the complexity sentences could take with the right word usage. It was challenging, and I liked that a lot, too. <BR> <BR>So, just stick with it. The thing about a long &#40;or fairly long&#41; first chapter/prologue, if you aren&#39;t sure what your strong suit is, you can at least have enough down to better your chances of being in the ball park. <BR> <BR>However, as I can boast, nothing builds charactor like failures. I&#39;m not undefeated, and thanks to that, I&#39;m pretty darn good now. <BR> <BR>And I don&#39;t just mean in the ring... <BR> <BR>Keep at it man, and we&#39;ll keep reading.

Also, if you aren&#39;t comfortable just posting your stuff online, Driven is one of my closest friends from high school. He is taking college level english, as I will be this summer &#40;when things calm down, since I&#39;m in the Air Force&#41;. <BR> <BR>Him and I often shoot our works via email to each other for proof reading. It has worked out very well. The thing is, if I write a chapter, then spell check, then re-read, add words/ remove words, and spell check again, sometimes the computer &#40;and I&#41; miss stuff. I.E. &#39;There&#39; instead of &#39;Their&#39; <BR> <BR>I would gladly check over your chapters for you, if you like. I&#39;m certain most others wouldn&#39;t mind helping either. I might suggest some strategies, or find where a comma should go, or a wrongly spelled word, but I&#39;m not going to correct it to the point that it isn&#39;t yours anymore. <BR> <BR>After I get MSN messenger, hopefully I can include Infernus in my chain of proof readers. :P <BR> <BR>Just something I do to recheck my stuff before I post, but sometimes errors still slip through. <BR> <BR>Just an offer, and you have the right to refuse it entirely. I&#39;m not the only one willing to help out though. <BR> <BR><A HREF="mailto:cyberhillbilly@yahoo.com">cyberhillbilly@yahoo.com</A> <BR> <BR>Keep with it man, it gets pretty fun.
