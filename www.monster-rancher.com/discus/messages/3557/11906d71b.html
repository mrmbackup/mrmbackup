 &#40;Well, this one is very, very long. Have some time on your hands before reading.&#41; <BR> <BR>The sound of hooves rang alone on the cobblestone streets. The gate guards were instantly lifting their drawn crossbows into the night sky as Glory approached, not fearing the shadow outside the gate with him nearby. <BR> <BR>&#34;It asked for me, did it?&#34; Glory murmured to the closest guard. <BR> <BR>&#34;By name, sir.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Centaur&#39;s gaze narrowed with a sense of vengeance, wondering if the fiendish Kato had returned. <BR> <BR>&#34;Open the gates.&#34; <BR> <BR>Without hesitation, the massive wooden doors screeched and twisted, slowly opening the impenetrable wall of Languard open to the outside world. Standing in the dirt street, the darkened figure stood a good distance from the gate, probably ceasing its movements when the crossbows were loaded and aimed. <BR> <BR>&#34;A Golem?&#34; Glory asked himself aloud as the sound of hooves against stone resumed. <BR> <BR>The last step of the mighty Centaur slapped the hard earth with a resounding passion, staking his claim to this beautiful city without muttering a single word. <BR> <BR>&#34;State your business, monster.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You are my business tonight, old friend.&#34; <BR> <BR>Glory&#39;s eyes narrowed sharply, remembering the voice of a comrade long forgotten. <BR> <BR>&#34;Shinjin...?&#34; <BR> <BR>The Ape lumbered forward, placing the end of his right arm&#39;s club in the dirt before the Centaur, leaning on it. <BR> <BR>Glory pulled his spear up and over his shoulder, limply crossing his right arm over the shaft as he chuckled, &#34;I can&#39;t believe you are still alive.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;One might say the same for the fossil named Glory.&#34; <BR> <BR>Both monsters laughed slightly, mocking their own age. The Ape monster rose to his full height now, gazing down at the Centaur that measured roughly to his chest. <BR> <BR>&#34;Old friend, we have a problem.&#34; <BR> <BR>Glory said nothing as he cocked his head, peering up at Shinjin with his left eye, &#34;And that is?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Some one seeks the pieces to resurrect the Destroyer.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Centaur slung his spear to his side in a blur, &#34;Someone actually would be stupid enough to try and take it?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Far from stupidity, Glory. Much more dangerous.&#34; The Ape rumbled solemnly, &#34;Someone actually with the power to take it.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Who will come?&#34; The Centaur asked curiously. <BR> <BR>The Ape lifted his right arm, gazing at the studded keg he had for a hand, &#34;I do not know, but they have an army.&#34; <BR> <BR>Glory sprung quickly, facing towards the forest line to the east of them, staring coldly at the edge of it. Shinjin did the same, also hearing the bustling within. <BR> <BR>Slowly, two monsters appeared further down the path, and began making their way towards the gate. <BR> <BR>&#34;Scouting party?&#34; The burly voice whispered to the Centaur. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hardly. They wouldn&#39;t be dumb enough to get on the main road.&#34; <BR> <BR>As the Pixie and the Naga came more into view, Glory whispered to himself, &#34;I know them...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Finally.&#34; Lethander griped, &#34;I didn&#39;t think we would make it back until tomorrow.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Looks like we have a bit of luck on our side after all.&#34; Shilieka chimed, &#34;There is a Centaur up there, maybe Glory. That would save us some time.&#34; <BR> <BR>Her hunch was affirmed by his voice, but the words he spoke proved to disregard any form of luck they may have possessed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Guards!&#34; <BR> <BR>Several clicks from the wall made their presence known, both in sound and the shadowed heads popping over the city&#39;s wall. <BR> <BR>The pair froze, as the Centaur and a Golem approached. <BR> <BR>Shilieka&#39;s eyes squinted to pierce the darkness shrouding the massive beast&#39;s form, but could not achieve this task before Glory&#39;s voice entered her mind like a stampede, &#34;Now I have you.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Glory, you have a very big problem.&#34; Lethander spoke harshly, thrusting his right claws towards the Centaur. <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t believe you are in a position to make threats, Naga.&#34; <BR> <BR>The spear&#39;s shadowy point bobbed in front of Lethander&#39;s chest, ever threatening to pierce his heart. <BR> <BR>&#34;Pssh, and you wanted to come back and save these fools?&#34; The Naga&#39;s angry voice hardly measuring the rage in his eyes, dedicated solely to his accomplice. <BR> <BR>&#34;Glory please hear us out.&#34; The Pixie begged, and the spear switched targets. <BR> <BR>&#34;Where is the third spy?&#34; Glory asked harshly, &#34;Whoever you work for, you will fail. The little strike package your leadership cooked up will be obliterated when they try and take us. I&#39;ve already tripled the guards we have in the city.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We came with a warning, oh mighty Glory.&#34; Lethander almost spat the name, and the spear quickly assumed its first target once again. <BR> <BR>&#34;Where is the third spy?&#34; He repeated. <BR> <BR>&#34;Glory, we ran into an encampment to the east of here. Harvenger, the Kato, went back that way.&#34; <BR> <BR>Glory&#39;s spear lifted slowly, angled to just above their heads, he was pleased to be getting information as he stated simply, &#34;Proceed.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I know what you have in there, Glory.&#34; Shilieka lightly spoke, &#34;I know exactly what they seek to find and unleash upon this world again.&#34; <BR> <BR>This time, the heavy, black hand of the shadowed beast grasped the spear&#39;s shaft, pulling up very slowly on it. Glory flinched but for a moment before relaxing his grip. <BR> <BR>The large shadow behind the Centaur asked lowly, &#34;What do you know?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I know he wants these.&#34; She dug in the small pack under his left arm, pulling out something draped in a dirty rag. <BR> <BR>Slowly, she pulled back the cloth enough to expose the black disc chip and its yellow trim to the duo of monsters. <BR> <BR>&#34;Where did you find that?&#34; Glory asked, almost in disgust that a lowly creature would receive it. <BR> <BR>&#34;Frankly, I stole it.&#34; The disc disappeared within the folds once more as she added, &#34;From Moo.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Centaur&#39;s beak went slack jawed, eyes wide. Moo couldn&#39;t be trying to bring him back? <BR> <BR>&#34;Lies...&#34; Glory breathed out, lowering his spear towards her, &#34;All lies...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Let me say this once, pal.&#34; Lethander barked, stepping between the spear tip and the Pixie, &#34;Whether you choose to believe that it is Moo or not, there is an army out there, and they do plan to attack Languard.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Glory, I fear it is the same as the Elder spoke to me.&#34; <BR> <BR>The spear finally lifted, the Centaur&#39;s eyes seemed very sorrowful, &#34;Even Moo would not be so foolish.&#34; <BR> <BR>The large, bulky shadow started for the tree line. Glory turned his head towards his friend, knowing that he wouldn&#39;t be stopped even if requested. <BR> <BR>&#34;Come with me, I have much to apologize for, but even more to discus. If it is truly Moo...&#34; Glory paused, turning towards the city gates with a wave of his hand, &#34;Then I will need more men.&#34; <BR> <BR>The crossbows lifted. One head rose, then three beside it, then another one. The one in he middle actually had two helmets on sticks, plus his own, making it seem like three soldiers were there. Lethander smiled as similar actions had been taken across the wall to make their numbers seem larger. They would be needing some serious help. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...in the forest... <BR> <BR>Harvenger felt his legs revolting against him as he ran. He darted and bounced between trees, vines, grass, and the occasional boulder as he continued. Finally, he knew he had to take a break, but where would be safe? <BR> <BR>He sprung towards the closest tree, sinking his claws in deep. With quick upward exchanges of placement, he expediently scaled into the high branches, and breathed heavily. <BR> <BR>&#34;If they have trackers, there is no escape.&#34; He thought to himself, &#34;Too much blood.&#34; <BR> <BR>He sat there, quietly as he could, listening for foes. His mind raced, but the only thing he could remember was battle and death. He needed a strategy, and quick. <BR> <BR>His mind wondered, though, from stress or if he was just giving up, he couldn&#39;t tell. <BR> <BR>He thought about Howard, and how he failed him. He thought about Lethander&#39;s sarcastic jokes and the first match he had against the powerful Naga. Man, what a fight. He thought about the first time he met Shilieka, and they battled each other briefly before the Brothers interceded. He remembered the Dragon, Hesferion, and the brutal combat that took place just a day before. He remembered Lethander snickering at the Pixie, when she was spooked by the Lesione, and her threats to him in reprisal. <BR> <BR>The Lesione... <BR> <BR>&#34;That&#39;s it...&#34; He muttered to himself as his eyes grew big, &#34;The water!&#34; <BR> <BR>He sat up and froze immediately. Something was rustling the brush, and he turned his head slowly to see the black Durahan slide through the tall vegetation. A pure Zan appeared shortly after, and he wondered if they&#39;d lost his trail or not. However, when the Tiger appeared, he knew he&#39;d be found. The ones related to Naga were especially adapt at smelling blood, anyway. <BR> <BR>The Tiger&#39;s head shot to the tree tops almost instantly. Its eyes scanned the canopy with a vengeance, but slowly fell to the trunk. The Durahan walked over slowly, placing a hand on the gashes that climbed the tree. As his helmet&#39;s visor rose, he only saw the descending shadow for a brief moment. <BR> <BR>Both the Tiger&#39;s and the Zan&#39;s gazes instantly fell to the sound of metal on metal. The blood soak Kato was crouched behind the staggering Durahan, his helmet spinning on his shoulders. Shortly after, it fell off, completely detached as the armor fell against the tree and slid down. <BR> <BR>The Zan&#39;s limb&#39;s became alive as it charged the Kato. Harvenger spun around the tree quickly, allowing the piercing strikes to rip the bark in a flurry of stabs. The Tiger sped around the tree in pursuit, but as it passed, the Kato&#39;s claws sprang out, slicing the Tiger&#39;s front legs off at the knees. <BR> <BR>It howled in pain, but was quickly silenced as three claws slammed directly into its temple. Harvenger pulled his claws free just in time to block a spinning Zan&#39;s slash. He knew others would here the sound of the Tiger. He&#39;d better hurry. <BR> <BR>The Zan was on the offensive completely. A constant barrage of attacks fell towards his opponent, who was side stepping, back flipping, springing off tree trunks, and doing everything in his power to remain unharmed. The Kato&#39;s movements were quick, so he had better start anticipating them. <BR> <BR>Harvenger saw the Zan collapse suddenly, only barely seeing the sweep kick along the ground in time. The dirt flew from under the now air born Kato as he jumped the attack. He could not, however, evade the next attack as the Zan stood up in full turn for a spinning knee attack. <BR> <BR>The Zan snickered as his leg felt the resistance. He watched his foe slam harshly into a large, weed overgrown boulder to his left. He needed to capitalize, right now. <BR> <BR>Harvenger slid down the moss on the rock, and leaned forward when his feet finally found the earth. His vision blurred slightly, but he could still hear the ever light steps of the Zan approaching. His eyes flew up as the Zan struck, and he darted underneath the three attacks that came. <BR> <BR>For a moment, they stood there. The Zan held his right claw in the dirt, and his twin black extensions planted firmly into the stone. The Kato was kneeling some ten feet behind him, both claws outstretched behind him, head lowered. <BR> <BR>Harvenger placed his right hand under him as he fell, breathing deeply as his left claw went to the ground beside him. The Zan fell forward, all attacks still imbedded in there inaccuracy. The Kato stood slowly, knowing more would come. <BR> <BR>Gathering his strength, Harvenger proceeded into the woods once more, hoping that he was still heading west. <BR> <BR>At least an hour later, the blood soaked Kato, both his blood and foe&#39;s alike, staggered onto the bank of the river. He fell to the ground without his trademark dexterity, drinking deeply from the refreshing substance. He saw no Lesiones though. <BR> <BR>He slid himself into the water very quietly, ever scanning the environment behind him for incoming advisories. He dunked himself completely underwater, and spun quickly. As he rose, most of the blood had rinsed off, but a lot would require more scrubbing. His cuts burned from the water, but he slowly began rubbing his fur anyway. <BR> <BR>He heard several small snaps. He lowered himself, very slowly, to where only his eyes and head were exposed, and floated up beside the bank. A very humanoid looking shadow appeared, and a few others behind it. It was a Raiden, but like most of Moo&#39;s forces, it had a very cruel blood lineage to it. <BR> <BR>This one was yet another deadly relative of the Naga family. <BR> <BR>The Gargoyle stopped suddenly, outstretching his hand to his left. All the monsters behind him stopped and gazed, not sure of why they had been halted. His beak turned slowly in the darkened area they stood in, just before it opened into the clearing around the river. He stepped forward cautiously, sensing something in the air. <BR> <BR>He could smell the blood. <BR> <BR>Harvenger&#39;s head slowly dipped in the rest of the way, and he decided to attempt swimming across underneath the river&#39;s surface. He kept one hand on the muddy floor as he kicked his feet, slowly making his way across the bottom. <BR> <BR>It was not to be. Suddenly, the water and mud in front of him exploded towards him, slinging him back in a wave. He stood abruptly, chest high in the water, and stared in amazement towards the Gargoyle. The water was just up to the top of his thighs, and he was braced for combat. <BR> <BR>Harvenger glanced over his shoulder as more splashes rang forth. He extended his claws, then turned a full circle slowly, noting the monsters that surrounded him now. <BR> <BR>Directly to his left, a Blue Hare was up to his waist in the stream, bouncing his fists eagerly for the fight. Behind the Kato, was a monster he had not faced in a long time. An armor Arrowhead, no doubt related to the mighty Durahans, snapped its claws lightly with anticipation. To Harvenger&#39;s right, was a monster that he had only heard of in legends. The massive knuckles braced and twisted in the air, preparing for battle. The stance of the Jill could not be seen under his large coat, but Harvenger could tell its was sliding its feet apart. Even more rare, it was a relative of the Kato family, too. <BR> <BR>Harvenger returned his field of vision towards the ring leader. The Gargoyle sneered at his apparent victory, but held his hands forward in the customary Raiden combat style anyway. Harvenger didn&#39;t know how he could win this, but somehow he knew he wouldn&#39;t survive this night without anything short of a miracle. <BR> <BR>Harvenger heard the metal twist on itself and bounced to the right as the Arrowhead&#39;s tail erupted from the soft earth beneath him. His exit was quickly stopped as the giant palm of the Jill swatted the Kato back. He was flying through the air now, on a slight spiral. The Hare bounced into the air with an aerial roundhouse, knocking Harvenger into another spin and changing his course of flight immediately. The Gargoyle hit last in this chain, as he bounded into the air with a flip, and slammed his foot into the Kato&#39;s back. <BR> <BR>Harvenger hit the water with a large splash and the Raiden landed in the river as well, but much lighter. All four monsters began closing in. Suddenly, a giant, twisting blast of water erupted around a furious Kato. The Hare was immediately slung from the stream as the Gargoyle jumped to the shore. The two tanks withstood the watery vortex as most of the water was pulled into this cyclone. <BR> <BR>With a blur, the Kato&#39;s claws were skipping off the Arrowhead&#39;s hide. The pinchers snapped and swatted at Harvenger as the water either rushed back in towards them or fell in a rain. The armored carapace deflected all of the Kato&#39;s blows. Eventually, Harvenger appeared on the monster&#39;s back. The tail arched up with a passion, extending its stinger to impale its nemesis. <BR> <BR>Harvenger darted up its back, slashing harshly at the oncoming tail&#39;s tip. The end of the spike flew off in two sections, and the Arrowhead squeaked in what must have been pain. Before the he could react again, he saw a quick, blue blur beside him. As the Kato turned to his right, the Hare&#39;s long foot nailed him in the mouth. Harvenger spun in the air like a top at a slight angle. The Hare&#39;s other foot fired out and sent the Kato into the water once more. <BR> <BR>As his head emerged, a large hand slammed into the back of his skull and carried it down to the mud. He struggled against the raw strength of the Jill, but to no avail. He couldn&#39;t slash above and behind him with his body sinking deeper into the river bed like it was. He retracted his claws on both hands, and pointed them over his head. <BR> <BR>The Jill smiled big as the bubbles rose to the surface of the stream. Suddenly, anguish ripped through his mind as he felt three, sharp pains slam into his wrist. He howled and slung his arm into the air. As the Kato emerged, he tore his claws out of the monster&#39;s arm, and stuck the other set directly into the Jill&#39;s forehead. <BR> <BR>The claws retracted into his hand once more, and the massive monster fell back into the water. He turned from the body as its hands floated to the surface. The Arrowhead was on its way, and a very angered Blue Hare riding its back. His claws reemerged, and he pulled his left across his chest. <BR> <BR>Before he could put his right claws behind him, a very powerful punch landed into the middle of his back. He had totally forgotten about the Raiden. Before he could bite through the pain, another shock hit him as the Hare punched directly down, sending the Kato into the water in front of the Arrowhead. As his plunge slowed, he saw the claws coming down toward him. Each grasped an arm and pulled him free from the water. <BR> <BR>Harvenger stared weakly into the empty sockets of the Arrowhead, but then found himself raised to the level of the Blue Hare, who popped his knuckles with a smirk. A left cross nailed him in the face, then a right followed by another left. This solid combo nailed him with no challenge, and was finished with a solid back flip kick to the helpless Harvenger&#39;s chin. <BR> <BR>The Kato&#39;s head rose slowly, murmuring under his breath, &#34;You&#39;ll pay for that...&#34; <BR> <BR>The Hare only laughed as his straight punch landed directly into Harvenger&#39;s stomach. He gasped loudly, and soon after clinched his teeth. His eyes fixated on the chuckling blue bunny. Such an annoying laugh... <BR> <BR>The Hare started winding his left arm behind him, grinning brightly towards his stationary target. His fist flew forward with a purpose, but he soon found out how fast this Kato was, and also how deadly. <BR> <BR>Harvenger pulled his legs to his chest with a haste that even the Hare&#39;s speed could not match. The blue rabbit stumbled and tried to catch himself on the cranium of the Arrowhead, and succeeded for the most part. However, he had no time to regain his balance before the Kato&#39;s legs wrapped around his head, and pulled him off the other monster&#39;s back. The Hare dangled in front of the Arrowhead&#39;s view as he struggled against Harvenger&#39;s leg lock. With a sharp twist, and heavy snap, the Hare&#39;s body went limp. <BR> <BR>The Arrowhead was shocked, and in this surprise, the grip on his right claw loosened. Harvenger&#39;s hand was free suddenly as he dropped the Hare&#39;s dead weight from under him. The Arrowhead was screaming as Harvenger&#39;s claws managed to find a weak gap in the armored wrist. The left claw fell to the water, letting go on the way down as well. <BR> <BR>As the Kato landed, he dove into the water, and sped under the confused monster. His claws sliced up in hopes that its underbelly would be weaker than the top. His claws hit deftly, and slid off.  The Arrowhead let his legs buckle in an attempt to crush the nimble foe. Harvenger barely managed to get to the side in time as the water rushed past him from the monster&#39;s bulk. He found his escape cut short as the monster&#39;s legs, which were acting like bars, trapping him. <BR> <BR>The Kate&#39;s claws slashed harshly, shattering them at the joints. Again, the monster bellowed with pain. Harvenger mounted the crippled beast once more, and his claws continued to skip off harmlessly in this blitzkrieg of attacks. He only barely noticed the Raiden jumped, but luckily he did. He darted off the Arrowhead as the Gargoyle&#39;s foot rammed completely through the armored back of the Arrowhead. Its remaining claw and head lowered into the water, never to fight again. <BR> <BR>The monster tore his foot free from the wrecked monster. He glanced at the corpse in disdain, then returned his focus to the very talented monster that opposed him. He smiled at the thought of a challenge, and set his hands in front of him for another round. Harvenger&#39;s eyes blurred, and he staggered slightly in the water. Maybe he was smiling because the Kato was weakened now, which would couple into his assured victory. <BR> <BR>Suddenly, several, very heavy footsteps resounded through the woods. The Raiden turned, slightly perplexed since it was coming from the west. The Kato and the Gargoyle both braced for combat as a large, studded club flew out of the darkness, colliding solidly with the monster&#39;s beak. The Raiden spun in the air and to the other side of the river, landing harshly against a large trunk. His eyes were wide with terror and pain as the giant Ape sped across the water, bypassing Harvenger all together. <BR> <BR>The Kato watched in a braced amazement as the iron fist went back and forward again. The bulk of the monster was blocking his view, but he could see the tree over his head. It buckled and snapped with the impact, and fell backwards. It crashed loudly, and whether this monster was a friend or foe, it would definitely bring the attention of Moo&#39;s other minions. <BR> <BR>The creature that was colored like a Ripper turned slowly towards the battle ready Harvenger. The Ape slowly stepped back into the river, and approached the Kato with caution. <BR> <BR>&#34;You are mighty skillful for one so small.&#34; The mighty monster rumbled, &#34;However, it is time for you to go back to Languard with your friends. We have much to discus.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You mean Shilieka and Lethander?&#34; Harvenger asked lightly, still ready for additional combat. <BR> <BR>&#34;They are safe in Languard, but we need to speak of your findings.&#34; <BR> <BR>Several sounds came from the eastern edge of the forest. Assorted monsters began marching out of the woods. The large Ape turned his head towards them, and chuckled lightly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Get out of here. I&#39;ll run these guys off.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Kato only gawked as this savior turned and marched towards the awaiting army. He wasn&#39;t one to leave a comrade, but somehow, this beast seemed more than capable. Reluctantly, he turned, knowing he&#39;d be more of a hindrance than an asset. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...in Languard... <BR> <BR>&#34;I see...&#34; Glory spoke in a low tone. <BR> <BR>Lethander and Shilieka were standing opposite of the table. It was, for all purposes, a stable. Except inside, Glory had amassed statues, books, several blankets for his bed, and even rustled up a table, with a drinking glass set included. Several drapes hung along the wall, all different colors. However, this building had no windows, they were simply decorations. It was quite an amazing home, for a monster anyway. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, the Master Moo sent assassins after you when you claimed the disc piece from his fortress?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes. The Brothers of Misconception, as they call themselves.&#34; Shilieka spoke, raising the glass to her lips. <BR> <BR>&#34;And the Dragon, Hesferion, does he play a part?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;He knew Harvenger by name, &#34; The Naga threw in, taking in the colors of a red drape set, &#34;So he must know something.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, I had an entire team of Jainnes go missing recently, out searching for you. Only one returned, and she died shortly after. She claimed that it was an army.&#34; Glory poured another glass of wine for his Pixie guest, &#34;Shinjin&#39;s tribe also reported seeing troops in the forest.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We saw them all right.&#34; Lethander spoke as he returned his vision to the Centaur, &#34;It was a good size group, but not enough to sack this city.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That&#39;s just it. When you two showed up, I had my men stretched on all walls. We need to know if they are going to strike the east side directly, to allocate out men better.&#34; Glory sighed, sipping his drink. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, they were bunkering down.&#34; The Naga added, &#34;I can guarantee that, at a minimum, there will be a diversion front there. They just didn&#39;t have the numbers to take this place out.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;So, you mean they must have more troops either on the way,&#34; The Centaur leaned over the table, &#34;or on another front?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We are talking about Moo here, and unless his power took a sharp turn down recently without me hearing about it, I know he has more.&#34; Shilieka asserted, &#34;Place the main forces at the palace, to defend the disc piece.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Not that easy, fair Pixie.&#34; Glory spoke while crossing his arms over his chest, &#34;I have people that need protection, too. I refuse to sacrifice them.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We can guard it.&#34; Shilieka offered. <BR> <BR>&#34;I will have to disagree.&#34; Lethander asserted, &#34;They&#39;ll need more people on the front, and I think the gate will be a prime target. It&#39;ll be much easier to tear down that wood than a chunk of the city wall.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;The gate is on the southeast corner of the city, but the palace is in the northwestern section. Why would they waste their time traversing all of Languard?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;ll be easier for their ground forces to enter that way. Plus, you just admitted that you wouldn&#39;t expect it.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;All right. Lethander, I charge you with the main gate. Shilieka, you&#39;ll be in the chamber with the piece. If we start losing the battle, take the other chip and escape with both of them.&#34; Glory pointed to them respectfully as he spoke, then added, &#34;I&#39;ll watch the front of the palace wall, and try to stop any pushes into the castle.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, that settles it, huh?&#34; Lethander chuckled, popping his wrist. <BR> <BR>&#34;Not quite, the King will have the final say, but I&#39;ll request the Princes stay in the castle as well. They&#39;ll be of great service. I believe you already met them?&#34; Glory nodded towards Lethander. <BR> <BR>&#34;You mean the hot and cold guys, huh?&#34; The Naga frowned, upset that they didn&#39;t let him kill Hesferion. <BR> <BR>A sudden pounding at the door ended the conversation as Glory spat, &#34;Enter.&#34; <BR> <BR>An armored Garu stumbled through the door, standing at attention as he regained his balance, &#34;Sir, the Kato has returned!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;About time...&#34; Lethander groaned. <BR> <BR>Shilieka was already out the door. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...at the front gate... <BR> <BR>&#34;Halt! Don&#39;t move!&#34; <BR> <BR>One of the human guards growled from the top of the gate. Harvenger stared up at him, slightly confused. <BR> <BR>Blankly, he shouted, &#34;Open the gate.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t think so, you wait right there for the caption to get here.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t have time for this...&#34; <BR> <BR>His claws extended quickly as he jumped at the door. His claws sunk deep into the hard wood, and he began scaling the large door. <BR> <BR>&#34;H-halt! I said halt!&#34; <BR> <BR>He heard the first bolt buzz threw the air, and quickened his pace. He reached the top with a quick flip, then sunk his claws in the other side. Climbing down, two more bolts stuck into the door beside his head. He was very frustrated by this point. <BR> <BR>He retracted his claws and landed lightly. In no hurry at all, he walked down the main street towards the palace. <BR> <BR>&#34;Harvenger!&#34; <BR> <BR>He turned completely, not seeing who spoke to him. Looking up, he noticed the blonde hair, black winged Pixie coming in to great him. She was all smiles, and that always made him feel better. He noticed her quick change of happiness to fear as she closed the gap between them. He knew he looked rough, with cuts and blood scattered over his entire body. <BR> <BR>She landed and ran to him quickly, almost crying, &#34;What happened to you?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, the Brothers are here, and they brought some really tough friends.&#34; The Kato fell to a knee, in the worst shape he could ever recall being in. <BR> <BR>Glory and Lethander appeared on the road as she managed to get under his arm, trying her best to carry his weight. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh man...&#34; The Naga breathed heavily, &#34;This is serious if he got roughed up that bad.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Centaur didn&#39;t respond, just stared at the Kato briefly before asking, &#34;Where is Shinjin?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;The monkey?&#34; Harvenger asked weakly, &#34;He is still out there...somewhere...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Lets get him to the clerics quickly.&#34; Shilieka sputtered, just shy of crying aloud. He was in terrible condition. <BR> <BR>Lethander lifted him into his arms, and began carrying him towards the palace. As he passed Glory, Harvenger spoke lightly, &#34;You better get ready. Moo&#39;s boys are pretty tough, and I didn&#39;t meet any of the strong ones.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Centaur said nothing, just stared at the gate, wondering if Shinjin was fine or not. He turned with a quick shake of his head. That Ape could take care of himself just fine, right now the city needed his attention. This battle will be one he couldn&#39;t afford to lose. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...Somewhere north of Languard... <BR> <BR>Plague&#39;s eyes were fixated on the ground as he walked alongside his comrade. Did they really mean to sack Languard? <BR> <BR>&#34;Do you really feel it is necessary?&#34; The Tiger asked quietly, &#34;Or are you just following orders?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, I am following orders, but if it keeps the Destroyer out of Moo&#39;s control, I&#39;ll do whatever it takes.&#34; Was Grimlock response. <BR> <BR>Plague glanced up to the Joker with a slightly worried look, &#34;Why does he want to sack Languard?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Two reasons. Firstly, we need more forces to take on Moo.&#34; He spun his scythe while switching the hand it was in, &#34;Secondly, they have a piece of the disc.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;The disc...&#34; The Tiger echoed. <BR> <BR>&#34;I understand that it is your home, but it is not the same as you left it.&#34; Grimlock waved his hand in front of him, &#34;It is a haven for treachery and thieving. It truly deserves to be purged of such filth.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No one deserves to die for that reason...&#34; Plague spoke hoarsely, turning his stare ahead, &#34;I think I need to talk to Helix. I can get the disc if that is all he wanted.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You will meet him soon enough.&#34; The Joker snickered, &#34;He will be most pleased with one as powerful as you.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Tiger decided not to continue the conversation, and would just have to wait and confront this Helix charactor himself. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...In the Fortress of Moo... <BR> <BR>&#34;Time to set this in motion.&#34; <BR> <BR>Moo stood at the head of the table, pointing at the eastern section of the map, &#34;Kaidass, Kul&#39;dratz, Hesferion. You three will assault the eastern wall. Kaidass will take to the northern corner, assaulting the north side of it. Nightsickle with hit the northern corner as well, but directly from the east. Do your best to secure this position. Hesferion, you will take the fifth battalion south to the main gate and storm it. Either open it or destroy it, just open a path for the third and fourth divisions to get a clean shot into the city.&#34; <BR> <BR>His hand slid across the city schematics, thumping the palace itself three times, &#34;Here is the main target of the western assault. Jagged, Kalanor, and Skaythe, you are in charge of these skirmishes. Keep them occupied until our main force is within the walls. Jagged and Kalanor will attack the palace defenses directly from the west. Skaythe, you will fall slightly south with the demolition teams, the first and the second battalions will be behind you. Break through the wall, and get a foot hold there, so more troops can enter the city from the western side, directly south of the palace.&#34; <BR> <BR>Moo pulled his arms across his massive chest with a smile, &#34;We&#39;ll execute our main palace assault from the south and east. Once we claim the city, we can overrun the castle with all our forces combined.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Very good, Master Moo. The city will fall with ease.&#34; Kalanor complimented. <BR> <BR>&#34;This should be exceedingly simple.&#34; Kaidass spoke roughly, &#34;Should the fortress itself even bother to get involved?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No. It will hold a single battalion as a contingency. Should you fail...&#34; Moo&#39;s eyes narrowed sharply, &#34;I know this will not happen.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Will you take to the field as well, master?&#34; Kul&#39;Dratz asked inquisitively. <BR> <BR>&#34;If the situation requires, I will personally bring the palace down on their heads!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Then it is settled, Moo. The attack begins at dusk tomorrow&#34; Hesferion spoke as he stood to his full height, clinching a fist, &#34;The city will be yours by that midnight.&#34; <BR> <BR>-Oh well, couldn&#39;t get a suitable cliffhanger this time. Hope you enjoy anyway.- CHB

 WTF do you mean, not suitable? If this isn&#39;t suitable, I don&#39;t know what is. A much better job than some others in the past. I expect something like this for 15.

 This was more of a &#34;I feel like fighting&#34; mindset. <BR> <BR>Yeah, it was the best hook I could manage for the next chapter, but I still wasn&#39;t overly happy with it. <BR> <BR>Next chapter coming soon &#40;I hope&#41;
