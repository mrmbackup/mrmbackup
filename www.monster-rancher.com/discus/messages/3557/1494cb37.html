 A small fire bruned in the small clearing withing the Lost Elf woods. Many a legend told tales of beautiful creatures in the night, protecting this forest. Since they were merely taking shelter in case of rain and to provide protection from a far greater threat, they thought nothing of the myth. However... <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, if they run aerial reconnaissance, they should miss us.&#34; Vyger said as he stared up through the branches of oak that stretch over the campsite. <BR> <BR>&#34;If they have an army at all. He could have been bluffing.&#34; Jace said as he broke another stick over his knee and put it in the fire. <BR> <BR>&#34;Really...&#34; Roketh said, staring into the fire, &#34;Like he bluffed about his power?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I see...still kinda sore that he put up a fight, eh?&#34; Vyger said, lowering his gaze to meet with the Dragon&#39;s. <BR> <BR>&#34;Your little attack didn&#39;t do much more than tick him off. Really it just amused him.&#34; Roketh said as he stood up. Vyger did as well. <BR> <BR>&#34;Then let us see just how much power those two dead beats gave you!&#34; Vyger said. He jumped backwards and pushed himself off of one of the large trunks. He careened into Roketh with such force that they both broke one of the largest trees in half. Roketh kicked him off and shot a fireball in Vyger&#39;s direction. Vyger dodged it and it flew deep into the woods. A sudden explosion rang forth from the forest. Vyger spun and nailed Roketh in the mouth with a mighty punch. Unlike Hydra&#39;s from legend, Vyger had arms, and they were large and muscular, even enough to compare to Roketh&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Just then, a ball of pure electricity landed between the warring monsters. The ensuing explosion knocked both beast in opposite directions. Vyger was first to his feet. He stomped, sending bolders up through the ground and into the forest. Each head then unloaded a different elemental attack. The woods became alive with lightning, fire, ice, and earth. As Roketh stood he too, launch a massive offensive into the woods. <BR> <BR>&#34;DEMON FLARE!&#34; He screamed as he launched his best attack. A ball of red energy appeared in front of his mouth, then it covered it. The covering then became filld as Roketh surged flame into it. The net-like structure grew into the form of a large monster, demonic by most standards. It was then prepelled into the forest by a stream of fire, lighting the area in which it passed. Some sort of humans resided there, unvieled by the passing fire. Their eyes followed the attack as it went by, all in awe. Screams were heard as the fire ran through the legions of Wood Elves. Their bodies could be seen in the flame as the attack passed. They were incinerated almost instantly, but it was long enough to hear their screams of un-natural agony. The Demon Flare then exploded. The explosion was far enough away that the trio was not hurt, but so large that some of the Elves were thrown from the woods in a flurry of wind and force from the explosion. The Elves scattered for the most part, the braver stayed behind to claim vengence. <BR> <BR>Jace noted what weaponary they had. A staff at first glance, nothing more. Then, one of the Elves launched a bolt of lightning out of the end of it. A gem of some sort sat on top of it. The lightning bolt hit with enough force to knock Roketh of of his feet. Other elements began to pop out of the woods. Ice bombs nailed Vyger, while Jace barely evaded a fireball. A high pitched scream rang forth and all of the Elves ceased fire. Seconds later, they had disappeared. None were around, not even the dead. <BR> <BR>&#34;Foul creatures. You dare attack us. Well, contend with me barbarians!&#34; A voice came from the trees above. A pixie wearing a brown robe then lowered herself into view. She too, had a staff. Hers was obviously one for the leader. The gem was shped as a star. It was a blueish color, not like the regular pink tipped ones. She pointed it towards Vyger and asked calmly, &#34;What purpose do you die today for?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Get this strait lady, your little minons attack us when we had a...&#34; Vyger paused and looked at Roketh, &#34;...disagreement.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Is that so. Then why oh why...&#34; She stared at him, &#34;...is that Elven School demolished? Why is that little Elven girl dead? Twas I who rallied the troops against you, and I who fired the first shot.&#34; <BR> <BR>At this points, eyes lit up the forest. Green eyes began to spring up all around them. The Pixie then cast off her robe to reviel herself. She was abnormally muscular for a Pixie. Then again, she was also a unique. She was dressed some what like an amozon, with wings. These wings were unusually large for a Pixie breed of any kind. She boasted a large scar one her right arm, and a crown made of twigs and such. Almost like a warrior dryad. She spun her staff and eventually stooped it behind her in her right hand. Her left shot up and began to glow. Small, yellowish particals appeared a few inches in front of her hand, and began to go into her palm. Her very hand had turned yellow. <BR> <BR>&#34;You also destroied many Elven warriors. Not to mention much of our forest. Now, you suffer the same fate.&#34; <BR> <BR>The yellow of her hand quickly divided itself. It shot to the end of each of her fingures. A small, yellow glow was atop each of her fingures. Then, each shot out. The little balls flew off of her fingure tips, towards the three. Roketh shoved Jace out of the way. Jace landed in the brush, and was quickly seized by seemingly hundreds of unseen persons. He attemted to scream, but was quickly subdued and carried into the woods. Roketh and Vyger had bigger problams. The little balls began to hover and dance in front of them. Then they smashed into the ground about the two beast. Each one making a rather massive explosion, despite their small size. Roketh found himself blinded by the uprising dust. <BR> <BR>Vyger was heards cursing, &#34;Damned trickster. Wait till I sink my claws into-&#34; He was cut off be a faint glow in the direction of the Pixie type. The smoke began to clear and they both saw that it was the point of her spear glowing. She now had gripped it with both hands. It began vibrating at her side, and she tightened her grip. It seemed as though the ensuing attack would be hard for her to control. Indeed it was. Two, large lightning bolts shot at the two monsters, who had little to no time to react. The Pixie was wrestling the staff, as to keep its power focused on the two invaders. Roketh was forced to a knee, while Vyger fell on his back. They then were both hit with a massive surge of energy that knocked them both out of the woods. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ha. Thats all?&#34; The Pixie mocked as her and her legions emerged from the dark forest. &#34;I expected more from you two. Seeing as much as you&#39;ve already destroied.&#34; <BR> <BR>Then, a massive fireball smashed into the Pixie&#39;s legions. a massive figure appeared from above. The most fear inducing Dragon that the pixie had ever laid eyes on appeared. A large purple dragon landed between the two opposing forces. <BR> <BR>&#34;Greetings. My name is well known through out these parts and I appriciate the help. I do believe I can handle this from here.&#34; The massive Dragon spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;Sorry that you are not known around here. Step aside, before my wrath befalls you as well.&#34; The Pixie tried to cover her fear, and done a good job of it. <BR> <BR>Then Vyger jumped on the back of the massive Dragon. Vyger was slung into the air almost instantly. <BR> <BR>&#34;FLAME PULSER!&#34; The Dragon&#39;s voice rang. Roketh looked up as the Dragon kneeled. A large cannon emerged from his back, from between his wings. A small glow emitted from the barrel. Then, a blast of energy errupted from the cannon. The blast pushed the massive dragon ever deeper into the ground. It was not just a shot, but a steady beam rang forth from the cannon. Vyger was nailed in midair. The explosion dwarfed that of Demon Flare. <BR> <BR>&#34;NO!&#34; Roketh screamed as he charged the back of the Dragon. The Dragon swung his metal tail into the chest of Roketh. Roketh flew some twenty yards and landed on his back. He jumped up, enraged. The Dragon turned and stared. <BR> <BR>&#34;I beleive you saw my brother&#39;s evolution. At the same time, we all evolved. Our master is generous indeed. I am on par with Nightmare, our ex-leader. The master&#39;s son, Galin, is our new leader. By the way, names Dragonaught.&#34; <BR> <BR>At this point, Roketh saw what he was up against. A Techno Dragon, except it was silver. Its jaws were more like can openers. Spining razors instead of teeth. Metal wings sat on his shoulders. His eyes were deep sockets, nothing more. He turned, and looked like a weapon himself. On his right hand, a gattling gun was instead of a claw. His left was a large, metalic claw. On that forarm resided a cannon of some sort. His chest opened like a compartment. Two, large gattling guns sprang out. Off each shoulder a small cannon appeared. Off the other forarm, a gun lowered down, below his gun arm. His claws retracted, revieling five, miniature missles. His lower jaw well down, and emerged a beam cannon of some sort. The joint of each wing sprang a small, box-like structure. Each opened, unveiling a small silo stocked with the mini-missles. The large cannon between his wings rose above his head. It then pointed towards Roketh, as did all of his weaponary. Roketh was awe struck. <BR> <BR>&#34;ATTACK!&#34; the Pixie screamed. A million lightning bolts, fireballs, and ice bombs errupted from th woods. Each merely bounced off the oversized machine. He turned and the fireing increased. <BR> <BR>&#34;OMEGA MAX!&#34; His back cannon began to gather energy from the surronding area. Then, everything he had fired at once. Missles, bullets, and partical weapons ripped intot the forest. The only thing he could actually target or see was the Pixie, whom he targeted his big gun at. The beam hit her on the mark. The beam traveled deep intot he forest before errupting. The explosion this time was even bigger than the one that killed Vyger. <BR> <BR>&#34;Vyger...&#34; Roketh said as he stood. &#34;Dragonaught, your fight is with me.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dragonaught closed all of his weaponary before turning, &#34;Ah yes, you defeated Nightmare. That is of course why he was relieved of command. He is very angry, and will be even more so when he hears I destroied you before he could.&#34; <BR> <BR>Then, a massive lightning bolt landed into Dragonaught&#39;s back. This blast knocked him to a knee. He was indeed surprised that any could knock him down. He turned and was even more surprised to see the Pixie. <BR> <BR>&#34;Too slow, Dragonaught. You&#39;ll have to do a lot better than that.&#34; She said as her eyes grew red, &#34;DEMON CHANGE!&#34; <BR> <BR>The Pixie&#39;s skin ripped of of her body. Everything went black. The sky, the land, everything. The only light was from an eerie, red glow just behind the Pixie. Then it was apperant, this was no Pixie. The red lighting showed her true form. A demon like creature was in a ball, within the shell of the Pixie no doubt. It uncurled itself to show that it was well the size of Dragonaught. It became obvious that this was of no known breed. Roketh and Dragonaught were amazed by the sudden boost in power. The red faded and the sky and world returned. <BR> <BR>What remained, however, was not at all a good thing. A demonic creature appeared before them. human-like in every way, almost. In one hand resided the largest scythe Roketh had ever seen. Even rivaling the scythe of the rumored Joker&#39;s of the Northern Isles. Roketh had seen and battled them before, but this was unbelievable. The scythe was big yes, but not near as big as its wielder. The beast was a evil looking charactor. Armored shoulders that ran into an ebony breast plate. A horn coming off of each shoulder. His face ws long, with two, massive horns there as well. His smirk was an unforgiving, and unforgetable one. He had legs like a horse instead of a man. Built, with hoves instead of feet. A torn loin-cloth held up by a belt, with a human skull as a buckle. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Azurian, The Lord of Darkness. Also known as the Reaper. I will swallow your soul fool. My Lord, I will protect you.&#34; The demon said as he gripped his scythe with both hands. He swung at the Dragon, but he jumped back. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, you are the mighty Lord of Darkness. You also have been stealing the master&#39;s title, Lord of Death. I was orderded here to smash you and your lord as well.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Then let me assure you...&#34; Azurain said with a cold stare, &#34;...you&#39;ll have literal hell accomplishing that.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh was a bit confused until he remembered, &#34;He is one of the Eight Lords.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh jumped up and joined Azurain. Dragonaught laughed at them both. <BR> <BR>&#34;My Lord, you can not be defeated. Flea now!&#34; Azurain said as he prepared for battle. <BR> <BR>&#34;If you are defeated, or just one of the lords, all is lost. We must protect each other.&#34; <BR> <BR>Then, a huge shadow fell over head. Three Dragon&#39;s approached from the north. <BR> <BR>&#34;The Dark Lords...&#34; Azurain said as he stared into the distance, &#34;We will not survive.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll be damned!&#34; Someone behind them said. As they looked, Jace emerged from the woods, with the Star Staff in hand. Behind him, an army of Elves. Wood Elves on Griffon back rode forth from the woods. An army of Elves came out of the backs of large, armored beetles of some kind. The three Dragons still came from the north, their shadows ever looming in the dim light of the moon. <BR> <BR>&#34;This will be a day to remember.&#34; Roketh said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Indeed...&#34; Dragonaught said with a laugh, &#34;I haven&#39;t slaughtered so many in my life! I will savor this, goodly beast! Witht he aid of my brothers and my master, you stand not a chance.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>The battle lines are drawn, but will the Wood Elves aid be enough to defeat the Vile Lords? <BR> <BR> <BR>Stay tuned.
