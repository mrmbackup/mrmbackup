<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF='mailto:Richard@absalom.co.uk'>GARLANT</A></B> on <B>Friday, November 2, 2001 - 10:44 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 The summer air was thick and dusty with pollen.  A field of tall thin flowered plants was up ahead. There was a cry.  It was not a cry of pain or sorrow.  The cry was like a squawk.  The field came alive.  Heads came up from the field.  A little racoon face with inquisitive eyes like plates.  Two long ears poked up and waggled as the hare&#39;s head came up from behind it.  There were several other faces in the grass and they were looking for the source of the noise.  The cry ripped through the air again.   <BR> <BR>High in the air was a giant red dragon.  It was wearing gold armour and leg protectors.  On its back was a blimp carriage and inside were Sam and Tom.  They were head of IMA and FIMBA the two continents that inhabited the East side of the world.  Sam was old but looked full of life and happiness.  He wore a pair of goggles on his head and a big jacket.  Tom was a lot thinner and did not look as happy.  He looked a lot like the errantry manager.  They were talking as the dragon flew through the afternoon sky.   <BR> <BR>&#34;We must find out.&#34;  Sam said  <BR> <BR>&#34;It may be dangerous, who can we rely on?&#34; Tom asked.   <BR> <BR>&#34;We have never used the key yet, maybe this is the time.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;The key is meant for an emergency!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;This is an emergency.  Come on Tom, we are talking about new unexplored territory.  Anything could be over there.  The key may be the only chance we have.&#34; <BR> <BR>The town was deep.  People were flooding the centre.  Monsters and trainers talked and played.  Kain looked around the thick mass of people. <BR> <BR>&#34;What&#39;s this place called again?&#34;  He asked bitterly, he wanted to go to a place a little more out of the way.  <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s called Gego, stop being so annoying, this place is a meeting place for travellers.&#34;  Lisa tutted. <BR> <BR>A brown ball sped straight at Bolt and another flew for Kain&#39;s face.  They both hit with a stinging slap.  Bolt looked angrily around and Kain reacted in a similar matter.  Kain&#39;s face faded into a smile and he tapped Zack and pointed.  Across the town stood two women and two monsters.  One of the monsters was a red lizard like creature and the other was a tiny woman with wings.    <BR> <BR>&#34;Alex, Mia!&#34;  Kain shouted. <BR> <BR>Lisa looked strangely at him and followed the two running males.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Hi guys, how was your journey, wow, Houndine&#39;s changed a bit.&#34;  Lisa smiled. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah we combined him with this hare, some disc stone made him into a ducken.&#34; <BR> <BR>The ducken span around dancing and Bolt waved his arms at Mia. <BR> <BR>&#34;Wow, Bolt looks stronger than before!&#34;  Said Alex in the voice people use to talk to children. <BR> <BR>Bolt beeped happily.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Hi my names Lisa, this is my beaclon Destiny.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Girls looked at the huge bug and smiled at Lisa.   <BR> <BR>There was a sound of awe and inspiration from the general crowd.  Kain looked up and saw a giant fireball in the sky. The giant ball separated into four separate ones.  They sped for the four trainers and slowed down.  Four phoenixes landed next to each other in unison and threw scrolls at the feet of Kain, Zack, Alex and Mia.  Mia picked hers up first. <BR> <BR>&#34;Dear Mia, This is Sam reporting to you for IMA.  I do not know if you and the others are still together so I sent four separate phoenixes.  They all have the same content but the point is.  We believed that IMA and FIMBA were the only continents but we were wrong.  There is a small continent with parepare like terrain.  We are assembling a team of ten trainers.  Five will be from IMA and five from FIMBA.  This team will be sent to the new continent.  If you have any doubts we will be meeting in Gego within the next two days.  If you and the others are still together we need another strong trainer to make up the five, if you have a suggestion then bring them along in two days. <BR>IMA&#34; <BR> <BR>She turned to Zack and Kain and they all checked the papers.  They were all the same.  Lisa asked them how they met and they spent the rest of the day swapping stories.  Later that night when destiny was the last monster awake and the trainers were going to bed in a hotel, they decided they would invite Lisa as their fifth trainer.   <BR> <BR>The next day was spent training.  Destiny, Kea and Scissora raced along the dusty tracks just outside the town while Bolt and Fierce swam up and down a river.  The day went quickly and it was early evening when they saw a huge red dragon wearing armour fly towards the lab.   <BR> <BR>It was 8:00 when they got to the lab the next morning.  It was already open and full of people with monsters.  Sam ran up to great them. <BR> <BR>&#34;Zack, Kain, Mia and Alex, I have not seen you for ages.  Is this the fifth trainer? Excellent&#34; Sam powerfully shook Lisa&#39;s hand and looked at all the monsters. <BR> <BR>&#34;A beaclon, how great I have not seen one for quite some time.  And what is this, old Houndine is a ducken. Ok I think that is everyone, please all go to the yard out back.&#34; <BR> <BR>The trainers moved through a large door into a sandy area outside.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Now would everyone take it in turns to stand up with their monsters and give their name, number which is on a card being passed around as we speak, monsters name and a little description.  Now everyone in number order please.&#34;  Tom said in a matter-of-fact voice. <BR> <BR>A thin man wearing a purple cape stood up, he smiled then spoke. <BR>&#34;My name is Red, number one, my monster is called Leo.&#34; <BR>The monster was tiger like but dark purple, its eyes were very bright and shone from its head. <BR> <BR>Another man stood up and patted a great white armoured centaur.   <BR>&#34;My name is Jacob, number two, and this here is Kizor.&#34; <BR>The giant white centaur stamped its hooves and punched the air. <BR> <BR>Mia stood up. <BR>&#34;Hi, I&#39;m Mia, number three and this is my salamander, Scissora.&#34; <BR>Everyone looked to the red lizard. <BR> <BR>Alex nervously stood up. <BR>&#34;My name is Alex, number four and my monster is called Kea.&#34; <BR>Kea nodded respectively to the trainers. <BR> <BR>Zack checked his card and stood up. <BR>&#34;Hey people, I&#39;m Zack and I&#39;m number five and this is my monster Fierce.&#34; <BR>Fierce started dancing and people laughed at it. <BR> <BR>A woman wearing a pink jumper leapt up happily. <BR>&#34;My names Allyson, number six and my monster is called Veve.&#34; <BR>A tiny cat doll stared at the trainers; it had curly red hair and white skin.  <BR> <BR>Lisa slowly got up. <BR>&#34;Ok my names Lisa, I have a number seven on my card and my beaclon&#39;s name is Rocky, I mean Destiny.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kain stood up and coughed nervously. <BR>&#34;I&#39;m number eight and people call me Kain, this is my best buddy Bolt, say hi Bolt&#34; <BR>Bolt beeped happily. <BR> <BR>An old man stood on a stick.   <BR>&#34;Hi my names Tanno, and this is a very old but still strong gordish, Gorth.  By the way I&#39;m number nine. <BR>A golden kato with white clothes on looked contently at the trainers. <BR> <BR>The last women stood up and spoke. <BR>&#34;I&#39;m Sindy and I&#39;m the last trainer I guess. This is my friend Sally.&#34; <BR>Sally was a green jell with scales. <BR> <BR>Sam and Tom stood up in front of all the trainers.   <BR> <BR>&#34;The new continent mention in your letters is to the west.  It is a tropical paradise but we do not know if it is inhabited or not.  We are sending you in the plan known as the key.&#34;  Sam spoke mostly with his hands. <BR> <BR>&#34;We want you to explore for any signs of life.  In FIMBA we have monsters that you in IMA do not.  If we are this geographically close then imagine how different the monsters may be over on the new continent.&#34;  Tom spoke in his matter-of-fact voice. <BR> <BR>&#34;We will leave tomorrow.  We will take two dragons and drop you off on a separate island.  IT is in the continent but very small and we know it is uninhabited.&#34; <BR> <BR>They all slept in the same hotel.  The night was scary.  Kain looked around the room.  Everyone else was asleep. A whole new continent, untouched by IMA or FIMBA.  What could be waiting there?  Would there be people. <BR> <BR>The dragons flew quickly. Their huge wings flapped like giant sheets of paper.  Two red serpents gliding side by side across miles of ocean.  They finally reached their destination.  On the way down Zack stopped looking out the window and turned to Sam. <BR> <BR>&#34;Sam, how come you never saw this continent before?&#34; Zack asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;We don&#39;t know, it came out of nowhere. It was not here two days before we saw it.&#34;  Sam implied he did not want to talk about it.    <BR> <BR>They all got onto the island and the ten trainers got in two tiny boats carried by the dragons.  Two people on each boat grabbed an oar and they pushed off.  The waves were choppy and violent but it seemed like a fairly nice day.     <BR> <BR>The trees could be seen along way off.  They were thick, green and dense.  The great long leaves carpeted the sky and the grass was thick and tall.  The boast crashed into a very little area of sand and the monsters and people jumped out.  Kizor flipped onto his centaurs back and waved his arms to all the trainers. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok, we need to explore as much area as we can.  FIMBA and IMA split up, look around and be careful.  If you see anything then note it down.  We have all got walkie talkies so keep in touch every now and again.&#34; <BR> <BR>The crowd split up and went in separate directions.  The forest was incredibly thick.  However there appeared to be very little blocking the routes through the trees.  Kain stopped suddenly and Kea crashed into his back.  She fell back a little and looked at him.  Kain was very quiet.  The lack of noise was scary.  He peered at the treetops and through the bushes.  All the rest of the IMA trainers were watching him with anticipation.  He shrugged and walked on.  In the trees there was a movement, Kain did not notice it and it was very quick. A pair of tiny black eyes was desperately staring at Kain. The figure that the eyes belong to scampered off through the trees and down the jungle. <BR> <BR>&#34;IMA team reporting, you guys found anything yet?&#34;  Lisa spoke into the microphone. <BR> <BR>&#34;No we have nothing, isn&#39;t it weird how these paths are formed, its like there have been people here before.&#34;        <BR> <BR>Lisa just looked around and carried on walking, placing the walkie-talkie back in her belt.  The forest was dark now and the only light came from between the deep leaves.  Every so often there was a hole in the trees and a huge ray of light illuminated the forest floor.  Lisa&#39;s radio crackled and then came an excited noise from the other end. <BR> <BR>&#34;There is something here.  A huge temple, it...it...its amazing, there are massive pillars and everything its like a man made one.  There are faces on the walls and..&#34;   <BR> <BR>The radio went dead.  Lisa tested it a couple of times then shrugged to the others.  The radio looked fine but there was no noise from the other end.  They just kept walking.  There was not a lot of talking.  They were all quite scared and worried.  A totally new continent, there could be hundred of weird things here.  The forest started to clean up slightly.  Mia was watching the sky and suddenly saw a giant tower.  They ran through a bit more forest and came to a giant clearing.  A temple stood out in the centre.  It was tall and pyramid like.  Not Egyptian pyramid like but Inca or Aztec pyramid like.  At the top was a stone table and a doorway.  Zack clapped his hands together. <BR> <BR>&#34;Anyone wanna climb?&#34; <BR> <BR>The trainers slowly crawled up the tall steps.  They were high and craggy.  Destiny flew from step to step but the others had to jump and pull themselves up.  Eventually they made it to the top.  Alex turned around and looked out over the forest.  There were several other building peaks sticking through the mass of green.  The sun was still in the sky but starting to lower.  Kain and Bolt were the first into the temple itself.  The walls were white and gold.  They held pictures of faces and hands but the faces were wrong.  They were too round and not tall enough.  The hands were hairy and holding boomerangs.  Everything was inproportioned.  The trainers all entered a room. It was even nicer than the corridors.  Huge gold statues were there.  Monsters of all different types. All the statues were main breeds but still glamorous.  In one corner sat a golden tiger, Bolt walked up and beeped at a solid gold arrowhead.  Kain suddenly turned. <BR> <BR>There were footsteps in the passage.  Running footsteps. They were getting faster and faster and seemed to be panicked.  Kain was about to run down the corridor but a rock doorway fell into the passage blocking it off.  There was still a lot of light but no one could tell where it was coming from.  Kain ran and soldier barged the block several times and then fell to the floor. Fierce span around his centre section and tried to break the block but he just fell back.  There was a hiss and Mia screamed. <BR> <BR>&#34;There&#39;s gas coming in from somewh...&#34; <BR> <BR>She fell to the floor with the others.   <BR> <BR>Kain awoke with his eyes closed.  His head hurt and his knee joints ached.  He slowly opened an eye and saw the other trainers slowly awaking and getting up.  They were outside again in a cage.  It was fairly late and the sun was just a slither of light above the horizon. Bolt beeped faintly and nudged Kains leg.  Kain shot up and patted Bolt on the head. The other monsters were acting strangely.  Zack looked around.  They were in an empty clearing.  There were bushes all around them and they were all moving.  He saw a blast of light green under a bush.  He turned quickly and tried to follow it.  There was a whispering from the bushes.  The leafs were moulting from the greenery like feathers from a parrot.  The whispers were getting louder and louder and tiny bits of conversation could be heard by the trainers.  Zack looked around.  Every single face was a mask of fear.  A pair of floppy brown antennae stuck out from behind the bush and wiggled.  Then a brown head stuck out.  A monster that looked like a light brown monkey jumped out from behind the green.  He was fat and round and looked quite put out by having to walk around.   <BR> <BR>&#34;I think its a gibberer, an ape monster with something else as a crossbreed maybe a hare.&#34; <BR> <BR>Lisa whispered to the other trainers.   <BR> <BR>The gibberer scratched its back with its long arms then looked intelligently at the trainers.  A monster matching the first ones shape but with different colours pulled itself out from behind a separate bush.  A pure breed ape fell from a tree and landed on the cage.  Kain felt himself going white as more and more apes started walking up to the cage.  They all had sharp teeth in their large mouths and although they didn&#39;t look threatening the arms were huge and muscular. <BR> <BR>Zack remembered seeing an ape at the first tourney he ever saw.  His grand parents had taken him and it had been an ever-lasting memory.  The last match was between two creatures that had won all there others.  The outcome of the tourney depended on it. The tournament was only B class but both were exceptionally strong.  One had been a pure breed ape much like the one on top of the cage; the other was a long green caterpillar like creature.  The match had started off well for the caterpillar.  It swung its long tail around and hit the ape several times. The ape had grabbed its tail once though and swung it around his head throwing the creature the length of the pitch.  The caterpillars segments had separated and fired three multi coloured beams which had piffed harmlessly in to the sand and missed completely.  The ape had waved his arms then placed them over his face.  He rolled at the caterpillar then unleashed a barrage of slaps and thwacks.  It had taken four medics to stop the ape hitting the unconscious body.  Zack was not enjoying the thought as the ape reached down between the bars in the cage and grabbed at Mia&#39;s hair.  She screamed and hit the floor.  The apes burst out laughing.  They acted wrong.  They were too smart.  Kain suddenly noticed he had never seen an ape stand up properly, they always stooped or dragged their rears along the ground.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Stupid humans, how did you pitiful creatures get here?&#34; Said the first ape, his mouth moved properly and his voice was that of a humans. <BR> <BR>Alex looked sheepish and then spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;How did you learn to talk so well, where we come from apes are monsters and we are...&#34;  <BR> <BR>The ape&#39;s stare stopped her mid sentence.  The ape clicked his fingers and a gibberer and a flowered ape carried the cage away.  They were taken to a huge temple the shape of a stadium. <BR> <BR>&#34;You have tourneys?&#34;  Kain said. <BR> <BR>&#34;We do, stupid human now watch.&#34;  The ape pointed to the stadium where the doors opened.  Two apes came in dragging throbbing sacks.  They opened them and two humans fell out.  The humans were staring at each other strangely and angrily.  One jumped at the other and kicked him in the face.  The other retaliated and soon all the apes were cheering and waving with excitement.  After a few minutes one of the humans fell to the floor bleeding.  He didn&#39;t move and the other human waved his arms in celebration. <BR> <BR> <BR>The monkeys that filled the stadium went wild and the cage was soon whisked off to another room where it was dropped.  At the other end of the room was another cage and the five FIMBA trainers were trapped within it.  They looked unhappily at the IMA trainers as a bag of potatoes were thrown into each cage.  The monkey doing this looked genuinely upset. <BR> <BR>&#34;See how you like a bag of old, uncooked potatoes once a month!&#34; <BR> <BR>She wiped tears from her eyes and stormed off.  By now everyone was in extreme shock.  Kain could not understand what was going on, he did know that apes seemed to rule this place and acted like humans while humans acted like monsters. <BR> <BR>&#34;This is stupid!&#34; Screamed Lisa as she clicked.  Her eyes were staring off into nothingness.  She just screamed and screamed over and over again.  Allyson started crying in the other cage and her mum mew tried to comfort her.  An ape walked in and opened the IMA cage.  He looked angrily at all the trainers, grabbed Lisa by her neck and pulled her along the corridor screaming.  Zack looked nervously down the alley.  Allyson stopped crying properly and just sniffled slightly.   <BR> <BR>Kain munched unhappily on a dry lump of potato.  It was flaky and crunchy.  An ape walked in from along the alley and shouted to all the trainers. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok people, sleeping time.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kain sat in the cold darkness.  It was impossible to sleep on the stone floor.  There was a noise in the stadium.  It was impossible to describe.  A wet scuffling, like someone walking slowly through dew-laden grass.  Kain jumped.  There was a light coming down the pitch-black corridor.  It flickered and moved towards the cage.  All the trainers scampered away.  He wanted to laugh in a way.  They had only been here a day and already they were acting like animals on instinct.  Running from the light was just stupid.  Even so he still felt scared and moved slightly.  There was a shuffle and the sound of the cage being opened.  The pool of light that the flame carried illuminated a face.  Lisa was standing there with an ape.  The ape had a golden face and fluffy white fur. It was not forcing Lisa but walking along side her.  She motioned for them to follow her.  All of them did instantly.  They walked silently to the FIMBA cage and exactly the same happened.  They walked through countless corridors and passages to a tiny room.  Lisa bent down and lifted a metal disc off of a hole.  She jumped into the darkness and the ape waited patiently for the trainers and their monsters to do the same.  Eventually it followed them into the darkness.  They landed in a warm, lit room.  It was very nice, like a hotel room.  Four apes stood in the room talking and drinking from goblets.  They stopped when the humans walked in.  Suddenly they burst into cheers and patting.  An ape that looked like an animated statue walked up with its arms open.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Welcome humans, I hope you are ok but we have to... No wait I&#39;ll start at the beginning.  We are from another planet.  This continent you see is not real.  It is a spacecraft designed to carry us inconspicuously to earth.  We are from a nearby planet and over they&#39;re the rules of Ape monsters and humans are reversed.  Every so often they travel down here and take intelligent humans to sell on the black market.  We are different from them.  They think all human trainers are horrible and cruel to their monsters.  We know better.  We know how much fun and love that some trainers treat their monsters with.  We know how you are nice.  Whenever they capture some humans they hold them for a few days then freeze them. Soon they will return.  It&#39;s only four hours until they leave this planet.  You have to stop them and save the frozen humans.&#34; <BR> <BR>The trainers were standing scared and silent.  The apes were strange, even when they were on your side you felt upset and helpless.  Kain looked around to the other trainers, none of them were moving at all.  He jumped up and screamed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Lets get them!&#34;   <BR> <BR>There was a burst of movement as all the trainers started jumping and shaking the ape&#39;s hands.  There was a crash as an ape fell down into the room.  He ran up to the ape that had spoken to them and saluted. <BR> <BR>&#34;General, the others have noticed the missing prisoners.  They are on the look out.&#34; <BR> <BR>The general swore under his breath and stroked his brown chin. He spent along time explaining things to the humans.  How the freezers worked, where the main parts of the ship were located. The ape spoke like a human and Kain even started to forget that he wasn&#39;t one.  He kept his speech going and kept everyone interested.  Eventually it finished. <BR> <BR>There was a crash as soon as the final word was said.  Apes ran in.  One rugby tackled the general while the others pointed large red guns at the trainers.  There was a noise like someone slowly falling into water as a gun fired at the oldest person in the group.  He fell to the ground smoking.  The old Kato looked at his dead master and then angrily at the ape.  It laughed and aimed his gun.  There was a flash.  The ape&#39;s gun was no longer in his hands.  He looked panicky stricken as he turned and saw the gordish.  It was holding the gun.  It slashed it in half as three other apes aimed theirs at the little yellow cat.  Bolt looked at Kain and Kain nodded.  Bolts sting stabbed into a nearby rocky ape.  The ape howled with surprised pain.  The mum mew jumped and kicked the ape with both her feet.  He flew into Bolt&#39;s claws, which slammed shut around the rock body.  The ape went limp and was dropped to the floor.  Meanwhile the gordish was jumping around slashing all the enemies.  Apes were falling in all directions as new recruits jumped into the little room.  The purple tiger shot bolts of electricity from his jet-black horns and knocked another ape out.  The chariot was jumping backwards and forwards, kicking and stabbing with great power.  Eventually the onslaught stopped.  There was one enemy ape left and one good ape left.  They were on the floor at each other&#39;s necks.  The trainers crowded round and hovered as if they were unsure about what to do.  The apes themselves were talking in a strange language.  Suddenly one of them let go and threw himself into the air.  He disappeared amongst the rafters.  The good ape looked up and growled, he leapt up and started to follow him into the darkness.   <BR> <BR>Kain turned around.  The other trainers and ten monster were looking at him expectantly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Lets get those humans out of here and move.&#34;  He shouted.  They all made their way out of the room up a set of hidden stairs.  They moved amazingly quietly for a group so large. Apes were running in all directions when they finally found the room.  It was very silver.  Silver controls, silver lasers and silver machinery ran up and down as far as the eye could see.  Zack ran up to the shiny machine and pulled a lever.  A door opened and sprayed blue and grey gas in their direction.  Zack bolted inside the door and came back green.  Kain peered around the door.  It was wrong.  So wrong.  The people in there were monsters.  Half human half monster.  A mans face on a worm, a tiger like creature with human feet, a melted body representing a jell.  All were frozen in blue and grey and looked innocently into space.  Zack pulled the lever again and the doors slammed shut, Kain slowly walked to a corner and was violently sick.  Zack looked slightly better.  The other trainers looked at them worried and one went towards the window.  Kain stopped him.   <BR> <BR>&#34;We have to leave them, those are not humans, letting them live would be just wrong.&#34;  Zack whispered to Kain. <BR> <BR>Kain thought.  He thought deeply and looked into the depths of his soul.  He could hear music and smell things he had not smelt for years.  This decision could affect lives.  He felt a rush of power, he immediately felt sick at himself, he has a chance to kill someone or save their lives and he gets a surge of power.  Then he went way back, past countless memories and numberless people.  He reached what he was looking for. When he had been a starting trainer he had had a great monster called Mobby.  It had been a little pink moochi with light green head scales.  The monster had got quote strong for a beginner and Kain had wanted to combine him.  One day Mobby had been attacked by a wild zuum and put into hospital.  The moochi was in great pain and Kain had never been able to understand why the hospital had put the moochi to sleep.  He had felt sick for weeks and never wanted to raise another monster for a while.  Kain fell out of his trance.  Zack was watching him curiously. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well what do you think?&#34;  Zack said. <BR> <BR>Kain walked silently up to the machine and pulled a lever.  A panel came up saying, delete.  Zack looked nervous and went to say something, then stopped. Kain pressed the button several times then turned to the astonished trainers.  They walked out of the room and followed the long winding corridors for along time.  They did not see a single ape and made it to a suspended bridge.  Kain saw a flash of real light.  The outside was just a few metres away.  Below the bridge was a swirling mass of electricity and energy.  Kain slowly stepped onto the bridge and ran across.  A couple of trainers went then Zack and fierce.  Slowly all the monsters and trainers went across.  They were about to leave when they heard a slow meow.  The gordish was sat at the other end of the bridge looking upset and nervous.  He patted the suspended walk way then recoiled with lightning speed.  Zack looked at him then turned to Alex. <BR> <BR>&#34;We can&#39;t leave him there, go get him.&#34; <BR> <BR>Alex walked halfway across the bridge then stopped.  She looked upwards then ran back.  A huge brown ball fell and slammed into the bridge.  It rocked back and forth across the cavern of energy.  The two apes separated then dived again with their arms open. The cat watched in interest and hatred for the evil ape.  Its eyes were reflecting the two warriors when the evil ape jumped back.  The bridge rocked faster and further.  The good ape growled and slapped the enemy with his backhand.  The ape jumped off the bridge onto main land next to the gordish.  He did not see it as a giant banana appeared above the good apes head.  It fell onto the suspended bridge and the wires snapped.  The ape leapt forward and grabbed hold of the edge as the bridge itself fell into the sea of energy and exploded violently.  The evil ape smiled and pulled a gun from his holster.  Kain went to grab his hand, but Zack held him back.  The gordish was mad with hatred.  He lepta and the gun was suddenly gone.  The evil ape looked surprised then angry as he saw the gordish.  As he turned to look at it, Zack let go and Kain helped the ape up.  The evil ape stared at the gordish and laughed. <BR> <BR>&#34;You are just an ordinary monster, I am a hyper evolved being, you cannot win!&#34;  He sneered. <BR> <BR>The gordishe jumped and pushed the ape&#39;s chest.  His eyes hardened as he realised what was about to happen.  He fell backwards and exploded as he hit the surface of throbbing purple energy.  The temple began to sway and crumble.  The gordish was stranded on the other side.  The ape looked at it then concentrated.  His brain throbbed and pulsated.  He looked as if he was in pain.  Slowly a giant banana formed over the gap.  It was faint but definitely there.  It was solidifying and slowly dropped.  The gordish was with them in an instant.  They ran from the temple and saw the trees were swaying and falling.  The continent was falling apart and sinking.  Water was flowing in rivers through the trees.  They were marooned in a pool of ground amongst the water.  Kain looked around desperately.  There was a growl from the sky and a stepladder fell down.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Hurry up, get in.&#34;  Shouted Sam. <BR> <BR>A dragon was trying its hardest to stay stationary in the air.  Everyone climbed up the ladder and destiny flew the monsters that couldn&#39;t up their.  The sea overcame the island and it was gone.  Sam and the trainers looked excausted as the dragon flew in the direction of FIMBA.  <BR> <BR>They explained on the way home.  At the end of the story Sam nodded and looked totally engrossed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fascinating, a land where monsters train humans, fascinating.  It is such a shame about Tanno, I hear he was a good trainer.&#34; <BR> <BR>At the mention of his name the yellow and white cat looked upset.  He drooped slightly.   <BR> <BR>&#34;This monster needs a trainer then I guess.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll train him.&#34;  Someone said. <BR> <BR>The whole group turned to the general.  He looked very serious.  He explained he needed a ranch and a licence but Sam said it should be fine.   <BR> <BR>Four days later they were back on their journey.  Alex and Mia had decided to stay away and not rejoin the group so it was down to three people again.  They walked towards the sunset.  It was a cool evening and the air was a sweet smelling perfume.  Eyes were watching the trainers.  Eyes with hatred and fear.  Eyes that did not understand. <BR> <BR>I know!! I know!! this story is pants!! Please don&#39;t stop reading future stories even if I really did badly this time.  I liked the idea of the story but it just got harder and harder to write.  Never mind.  Still leave feedback.

 I like it! <BR> <BR>It is nice to see aspiring writers drawn in through the MR series. Rather flexible subject matter to right on as well, you can write about nearly any aspect of the game, then add your own. I must say I&#39;ve been reading the newer posts, and I am very pleased with them all. <BR> <BR>To all writers: Keep up the good work!
