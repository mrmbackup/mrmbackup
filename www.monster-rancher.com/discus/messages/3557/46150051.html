 Here is the first actual complete Weapon battle.  The first of five to be done. <BR> <BR>Chapter 10: Project Weapon: Hagar <BR> <BR>	The dust cleared the area.  Standing atop a large crater was the Renocraft type creature.  It was facing towards the group of spectators. <BR> <BR>	“Scatter!” Rancher yelled, the group of people began running in panic.  Several slits opened in Hagar’s sides.  Out of each slit a long metal pole with a pivoting machine gun extended out.  There were eight in all. <BR> <BR>	He opened fire on the fleeing people.  Thunderous bangs were heard through out the town.  Rancher and Wes hid behind a building near the back of the town.  Both were panting and sweating.   <BR> <BR>	“Do you think Killa Kan’s dead?” Wes asked.  Worry crossed his face and his eyes became watery. <BR>	“You already asked me that and I said I dunno,” Rancher said heatedly. <BR> <BR>	Several loud pops where heard as the machine gun fire flew through the wall.  Several zipped right passed Rancher’s head. <BR> <BR>	“Oh poop!” he shouted as he crouched and covered his head.  Wes ducked as well, and found it comical that Rancher was acting like such a sissy.  Then again they were fighting a killing machine and he was afraid.  Rancher just looked funny hiding like that. <BR> <BR>	Loud thumps were heard, then the wavering sound. <BR>	“Rancher let’s go!” Wes said pulling the man with him as he ran out of the back, right before the wall erupted in a white blast.  Hagar stepped out of the destruction, his machine gun extensions opened fire on the fleeing pair. <BR> <BR>	The bullets danced about Wes’ and Rancher’s feet, they turned to there left to get back into the main of the town.  They saw an open bar and ran inside.  They figured the majority of the town was already deserted. <BR> <BR>	The two set themselves behind the counter.  They rested for a second, panting harder then before.   <BR>	“Do you think he knows where we are?” Wes asked, keeping his voice to a slight whisper.  <BR> <BR>	Almost in response there was a huge crash, Wes and Rancher both found themselves in the middle of Hagar’s now energizing claws.  The creature’s large red, gleaming eyes were almost demon like.  This unsettled Wes as he began to fell the heat of the white energy building directly in front of him. <BR> <BR>	“Dear God help!” Rancher cried hysterically. <BR> <BR>	A large rust colored hand came down on the shoulder of Hagar’s claw.  Hagar was pulled back violently, Wes and Rancher saw that it was Killa Kan! <BR> <BR>	The Golem was in bad shape.  He had a few large dents, and a good amount of interior metal showing.  The shelling on one of the arms was off revealing the gattling chambered up inside.   <BR> <BR>	Killa Kan wrestled a bit with the Arrowhead.  Now that Hagar had his back toward the two humans.  They saw that his underside had hole in it where Killa Kan had fired his beam cannon at earlier. <BR> <BR>	Rancher drew one of his daggers from his belt.  He switched out the blade and steadied himself to jump at the open creature. <BR> <BR>	“Rancher let me help,” Wes said drawing his sword.   <BR> <BR>	Hagar lowered himself to avoid a blow from Killa Kan, and Wes saw his chance.  He ran up the back of the best and jammed his sword into a joint in the neck, though he almost ran into Killa Kan’s fist. <BR> <BR>	A few sparks flew from the place were the sword hit.  Then the machine guns all pivoted at Wes.  Wes let out a yelp and ducked as the machine guns all fired at once.   <BR> <BR>	Hagar was shooting blindly as he couldn’t see on his back.  Many of the machine guns destroyed themselves.  In reaction to that Hagar shot off his charged claws at Killa Kan who barley managed to ground himself fast enough as the white beams zipped overhead.  Killa Kan backed a ways to make sure Hagar didn’t get the opportunity to attack while he was on the ground. <BR> <BR>	The creature wildly charged at Killa Kan, causing Wes to fall off.  Rancher helped Wes out of the place as it was going to get even worse as the two Weapons fought.   <BR> <BR>	Killa Kan opened his machine gun and shot at the charging beast.  It took no avail as Hagar rammed into Killa Kan headfirst.  The Golem was grounded and winded from the attack.  Once again Hagar found himself on top of Killa Kan hacking at him with his claws. <BR> <BR>	Killa Kan tried blocking the attacks but found it wasn’t helping.  His unarmored arm couldn’t withstand much more damage.  Killa Kan was being pelted again and again by the massive metal claws of the Arrowhead.  Loud clanging was heard, as metal hit metal.  Sparks flew, raining upon the area.   <BR> <BR>	Killa Kan still had the cannon arm that was undamaged, but using that would leave him open, unless he wanted to sacrifice his unarmored arm.   <BR> <BR>	He decided to take care of this Weapon once and for all.  He let down his guard with his undamaged arm and shoved it at Hagar’s damaged underside.  He opened the cannon and charged it.   <BR> <BR>	Hagar hacked at the open arm and it began to brake and snap under the powerful blows.  Hagar found an open spot in the Golem’s defense and took that into account.  He struck several blows on Killa Kan’s face. <BR> <BR>	“Only…a little…longer,” Killa Kan said to himself. <BR> <BR>	Hagar didn’t notice Killa Kan’s plan, he recklessly struck at his opponent.  The damaged arm fell off and hit the ground with a loud metallic clang.  Now Killa Kan was helpless as Hagar clawed away at the Golem.   <BR> <BR>	Finally the cannon erupted with full force.  The white beam struck into the open wound in Hagar’s underside.  It blasted out of it’s top with the loud bending and screeching of metal.   <BR> <BR>	Finally the beam dissipated.  Hagar fell over lifeless.  He was dead, one of the Weapons had been killed. <BR> <BR>	Wes and Rancher stood outside.  The only hints of the battle were the consistent clangs.  But now it had stopped.  One monster had taken victor in this glorious battle. <BR> <BR>	Wes and Rancher stood in silence, but each held great anticipation.  Finally Killa Kan emerged carrying the limp form of Hagar over his shoulder.   <BR> <BR>	Killa Kan only had one arm now.  Several dents and open holes stood apparent on him.  He walked a few yards then stumbled to one knee.  Rancher ran over and helped him to his feet. <BR> <BR>	“You killed him?” Rancher asked, surprised that Killa Kan was even alive. <BR>	“Yes.  Only five more Weapons to go,” Killa Kan said, a hint of joking was in his voice. <BR>	“You need help repairing?” Rancher said indicating the remains of Hagar. <BR>	“Yes, he will help a lot.  He has those blasters that work without the whole cannon outfit.  Not only that but I need a new arm,” Killa Kan added, holding up the stump of his lost arm. <BR> <BR>	“Wes come-on let’s get King and leave,” Rancher said. <BR>	“I’m right here!” King shouted, popping out of a barrel that resided in front of a house.   <BR> <BR>	The group headed back out on the road after resupplying their food and water.  Killa Kan already began repairing himself.  It seems that he’s equipped with the proper tools.  A mini-torch in his finger, stuff like that. <BR> <BR>	It was only a two weeks away before they reach Midnight Valley.  When they get there, they’re that much closer to the end. <BR> <BR>-Nicholas D.
