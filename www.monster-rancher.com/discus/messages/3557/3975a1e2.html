I guess I&#39;ll give it a try! &#40;This is not one of my important posts!&#41; <BR>greenspun.com : LUSENET : Monster Rancher 2 : One Thread  <BR> <BR>Since &#34;Celious&#34; has been absent of projects the last few days, I&#39;ve decided to take his place &#40;temporarily&#41;. Note that I am NOT trying to dethrone him. I don&#39;t work the best with prides, anyway! &#40;I prefer the illusive vulpis Canus, myself.&#41; Enough of my babbling....ON WITH THE SHOW!  <BR>If you could create yourself in a digital image &#40;make yourself a video game character&#41;, what would you look like, and what would your attributes contain?  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Dewell Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000  <BR>Answers <BR>Eagle?! HOW DARE YOU! TRYING TO TAKE MY PLACE?! I THOUGHT WE WERE PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS! Joking. I haven&#39;t made any because I have run out of ideas. Hope I didn&#39;t offend you or something.  <BR>I would be a... &#40;Everyone on the board: Great. We KNOW what&#39;s coming. Oh well.&#41; a were-lion. My attributes would be Holy and Fire type attacks. Only always in the were-lion state. No human state for me! Can anyone say &#34;anthromorph&#34;? Good for you. I would be a great fighter....ripping through flesh with razor-sharp claws... striking terror in the hearts of my enemies....OOOOHHH....&#42;Shiver&#42;....Coolness man! Laters!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t worry Celious! The only way that one can offend me is to offend someone else. I hope that I haven&#39;t offended you in borrowing your idea of a creative session &#40;They get addictive so quickly!&#41;. Now, on with my description.  <BR>I, too, would be an anthropomorphic. I would be a six foot, four inch &#40;my actual height&#41;. I would have velvety soft wings, that are as pure as the stars in a midnight sky. These seem to emmanate from my back, and would stretch three meters into the sky, glancing at a 45 degree angle. My golden body is shrouded with a teal colored wind breaker, adorned with silver angular patterns, and opening up to reveal a basic white T-shirt. My arms are a genetc nightmare. The left arm is a dangerous talon, exposing the raptor-like spikes that appear to be fingernails. The upper-right appendage &#40;right arm&#41; is a twisted culmination of an inter-species marriage. It has four tips on the talon &#40;not counting the apposable thumb&#41;, instead of three, and has a fine layer of rusty fur protruding from the surface, with a small, almost leathery pad found on the palm. The fur continues to spread to the lower hindquarters, and thus, is tarped with a pair a regular fit blue jeans. The feet do not suffer from the problem with my arms, and are a fine set of landing talons. These beauties can grapple onto anything, and make excellent weapons! Still, I prefer the use of swords, if in combat. Although, my feet are free from the deformities, my tail is not so lucky. Unlike a normal Eagle, my tail is not a crest of triangular shaped feathers. Rather, it is a tarnished wave of fur, measuring half of my height in length. It is tipped with a cream tuft, making it all the more noticable. Finally, there&#39;s my head. It is the one of the most unusual occurences one may find in nature. Imagine a the head of a bald eagle with the pointed ears of a some sort of brown Canid, and razor-like incisors located in a, longer than average, beak. My eyes are emerald, but contain flecks that tint the amber, providing you look closely enough. You now have a face to go with the name. Maybe someday, the rest of you will find your true identity.  <BR>Note: This project is in actuallity a psychological test. It forces you to project yourself into an illustration that shows how you truely see things. Sorry for the trickery. Still, I think that it&#39;s a very intersting scenario. Opinions?  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Well THAT was descriptive. I wonder if I can describe myself that well. I haven&#39;t really tried to see what I would actually look like.  <BR>I stand about 6&#39;7&#34;. My body is muscular and toned. My fur is a gold- brown. My mane stops at my shoulders on the side, on the back it stops between my shoulder blades and is in a ponytail. A scar is over my right eye. I have claw scars on the left side of my chest, a trophy to my battles. On the left of my chest is a tatoo on the shape of a lion&#39;s claw and it has a cross behind it. I wear a pair of white pants, held in place by a white belt. The tuft on the tip of my tail is actually a small flame, with white mixed in with the red of the flames. My fangs are razor sharp. On the top each arm is fur that is more golden in color than the rest of the fur surrounding it. It begins right above the wrist and ends before the elbow. It is also about an inch longer than the surrounding fur. My eyes are brown with a golden tint. They have a look about them that suggests wisdom as well as power and honor. My paws have razor sharp claws at the end of each digit. On my right ear is a silver earring in the shape of a cross. I have a samurai sword strapped to my side, with an uncut emerald in the grip. The emerald glows from within with a white light. Emblazoned on the sword&#39;s blade is an enscription in gold:  <BR>&#34;To uphold what is just, to protect what is pure.&#34;  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>It wasn&#39;t as descriptive as yours, but it was the best I could do. How was it? Good?  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I would be a Chital monster&#40;well duh i dont have the chaotic imagination of Eagle&#41;anyway I would be of the Betrayer subreed Chital/Gali which means I am the only Chital breed to fight alongside Leos I picked to be a Betrayer because it would be cool to have me and a leo&#40;Im tailking to you Celious&#41;fighting together to fight moos henchmen.A Betrayer looks just like a regular Chital but with a Gali mask on his Chest and wearing a Gali coat from the waist down.I use my speed , power and skill to anailate the enemy.  <BR>To Celious:since somebody tried to write that gayass pixie story hows about me and you against Moo,are you good at that kind of stuff if you do e-mail me.  <BR> <BR>-- stupid &#40;<A HREF="mailto:twopacliveson@hotmail.com">twopacliveson@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Not bad, Celious! The problem that I see in your description is the objective correlative. Basically, you are telling an action, rather than showing it.  <BR>Ex. My mane stops at my shoulders on the side, on the back it stops between my shoulder blades and is in a ponytail.  <BR>To make this more descriptive, you could have said....  <BR>The sides of my mane seem to flow to my shoulders, whereas the back cascades to from a ponytail that lies between my shoulder blades.  <BR>I appologize if I hurt your feelings in this response. Your writing isn&#39;t bad at all, but your descriptiveness of your writing could use a little work. As for trying to be AS descriptive as I....don&#39;t worry about it. Many english professors claim that I have a natural talent for the work &#40;I&#39;m not trying to sound cocky&#41;. If this is true than it is completely understandable.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>/_&#92; &#40;I take my writing seriously. A little too seriously. Just ignore this. Just showing how I feel and I know I have issues.&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Celious! It was good. It&#39;s just that it wasn&#39;t overly descriptive. Would you rather that I lie to you. I would think that you would want to hear the truth, and isn&#39;t it better to hear the truth from someone that you can trust? I am sure that a little practice is all that it takes. I mean, do you ACTUALLY think that I didn&#39;t have to learn about this?!?  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>CHECK YOUR E-MAIL TWITNUT...I SENT YOU A PERSONAL MESSAGE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. IT&#39;S NOT A HATEMAIL OR ANYTHING BAD. JUST LOOK. And DON&#39;T lie to me. I need the honesty. Thanks Eagle. You&#39;re cool. ^_^  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Hey. That made me feel a bit better, somehow. And I hope I didn&#39;t hurt YOU in any way, Eagle. I just take things a bit too personally, that&#39;s all. Sorry.  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Hey! Since you can describe things so well, you MUST go to my 10th creating session. I think you could do REALLY good there. Laters!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR>Top of Form 1 <BR>Bottom of Form 1 <BR>Creating Session 10: You are a leader in the IMA.... <BR>greenspun.com : LUSENET : Monster Rancher 2 : One Thread  <BR> <BR>You are the Director of Events in the IMA. You have just recieved a missive &#40;note&#41; from the president of IMA. It reads:  <BR>Dear Director of Events,  <BR>The committee of the island has just announced that they will approve the making of a new holiday to recognise all monster trainers and to honor their hard work. You must come up with ideas for this new day. We will be waiting for your report.  <BR>Ivan Flak, President  <BR>You must come up with a new holiday to honor all trainers. Plan out the day and what events will take place. Examples are:  <BR>Battles  <BR>Special Events  <BR>Contests  <BR>Seminars on Monster Raising Tips and Secrets  <BR>And of course, music!  <BR>Now try your hand and see what you can come up with! Looking forward to it! Laters!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000  <BR>Answers <BR>Wow! This feels like my AP English class. &#34;Here is your topic for the day. You have just this hour to write your essay. Ready Go!....get those creative juices flowing.&#34; Man this topic could be like one of our &#34;In-class&#34; essays.  <BR> <BR>-- The Man &#40;<A HREF="mailto:djedmond@pinenet.com">djedmond@pinenet.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I thought all my Creating Sessions sounded like an assignment from english class. At least you aren&#39;t limited to an hour...! ^_^  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 13, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Celious! It was good. It&#39;s just that it wasn&#39;t overly descriptive. Would you rather that I lie to you.

I say, the boy has the right idea, but something just aint right in the head. &#40;Foghorn Leghorn impression&#41;  <BR>To everyone else:  <BR>I think that the celebration should be like a carnival, or something to that effect. First of all, there should be divisions for battling &#40;if not an S class could walk in and CRUSH an E class monster, and I&#39;m strictly for fairness in combat.&#41;. Next, the trainers will have to battle in accordance to honor. The trainers will adorn themselves with lightweight Metalner armor and shields, so that nobody is truely hurt in the conflict. The reason behind this, is because no monster will respect a trainer that wouldn&#39;t go through the same acts that are requested of it. They schedule might resemble this:  <BR> <BR>10:00AM - E class competition &#40;minimal requirement of 100L 50P 50I 75S 25Sp 50D&#41;&#40;maximum limit of 300L 400P 400I 250Sp 300D&#41;  <BR> <BR>10:30AM - Trainer&#39;s lessons in beginners combat, taught by Coltia.  <BR> <BR>11:00AM - Intermediate lessons in combat against intelligent techniques, instructed by Holly and Poritoka &#40;optional&#41;.  <BR> <BR>11:00AM - Trainer&#39;s E class Tourney - Items to boost intelligence or power may be used, but no blunt objects are allowed in the ring.  <BR> <BR>11:00AM - Intermediate lessons in combat against power techniques, taught by Tesca &#40;optional&#41;.  <BR> <BR>11:30AM - Advanced techniques in maxed-out combat, instructed by Pabs, Head Master of the IMA &#40;S class trainers only!&#41;.  <BR> <BR>12:00PM - Trainer&#39;s D&amp;C class Tourney - Weapons may be used, but must be inspected to ensure that it may cause no serious injury.  <BR> <BR>12:30AM - D class Competition - &#40;minimal requirement of 200L 150P 150I 125S 150Sp 100D&#41; &#40;maximal requirement of 500L 500P 500I 300S 300Sp 400D&#41;  <BR>I have a class, now, so I will continue this list later.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 14, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Can mine be extra tasty crispy? Thanks. And I need shoyu for this rice! I can&#39;t eat rice without shoyu! &#40;Shoyu is soy sauce, for those of you who don&#39;t know Japanese.&#41; Eagle, you don&#39;t think that I&#39;m serious, right? Just jumping on the bandwagon!  <BR>Eagle, you are a warrior after my own heart. Fighting contests of honor, strength, and skill, where the safety of the combatants is a first and foremost priority. You GO. You sure you&#39;re an eagle? Not a lion? Just asking!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 14, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Okay. Time for my two cents. Actually, it&#39;s more like $13.50  <BR>My carnival is a week long.  <BR>Day 1  <BR> <BR>9:00-9:15 A.M.- Speech by Ivan Flak of IMA to all trainers  <BR> <BR>9:15-10:00 A.M.- All E class monsters competing must go through a physical exam and pass to compete.  <BR> <BR>10:00-11:00- All monsters outfitted with light protective armor. Trainers also must wear armor, since they will be on the fighting field as well.  <BR> <BR>10:00-12:00- E class battles: Round Robin Style  <BR> <BR>12:00-6:00- Festivities and Seminars on Monster Raising Tips and Secrets. Seminar led by Pabs.  <BR> <BR>6:00-7:00- Awards given to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place monsters and trainers.  <BR> <BR>7:00-7:30- Closing speech by Ivan Flak.  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 14, 2000.  <BR> <BR>The Festival Schedule Continued  <BR> <BR>any time during the festival - Arm wrestle/Sumo with a Beclon, Golem, Dragon, Jill and/or Henger.

Center- What celebration would be comlete without some kind of childish attraction. This is the place where intelligence based monsters &#40;such as Pixie, Suezo, Ghost, etc.&#41; use their psychic abilities to do simple parlor tricks &#40;ie. the Suezo will read people&#39;s mind, the Ghost will perform magical card tricks, and the Pixie will make beautiful light shows.&#41; There is also a place where one may sleep, and endulge in massive fantasies, courtesy of the Suezo technique, &#34;Telepathy.&#34; &#40;No the fantasies are not ALL dirty!&#41;.  <BR> <BR>1:30PM - Festival Feast - A picnic area where one may enjoy the countryside, and grab a a bite to eat.

Unfortunately, I have no idea what this name translates into. I DO know that it is in some sort of Native American language. I also know that it was a proud name, for I was named after my great grandfather. He had two brothers....one was named Hoy Tecumseh &#40;not sure about the spelling&#41;, and the other was named Roy Hiawatha &#40;also not sure about the spelling&#41;. These were two VERY FAMOUS Native Americans, yet, there is no mention of the name &#34;Dewell&#34; in any text. I am guessing that this is some sort of totem, or emotion, or something, but I have no proof. I have been searching for years for this information! If anybody knows what this means, I&#39;m BEGGING you to help me! &#40;I don&#39;t usually ask for help, but this has been plaguing my conscience for years, now.&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 14, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Actually, the &#34;Are you sure you&#39;re not a lion?&#34; question was hypothetical in nature.
