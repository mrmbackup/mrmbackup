 I was frantic.  I didn&#39;t want to lose another friend.  But no matter how much I pushed against the door.  Slowly the sounds on the other side of the door faded, Durahan still fighting, and winning, I hoped. <BR> <BR>The sounds of battle died completely, but I still had to yell incoherently at Sarah and Angel to get them to help me push.  With a slow rumble, and a rasp of some thing heavy in front of the door, I wedged myself between the two doors and pushed until I could leave, and survey the &#39;doorstep&#39; of this grand temple. <BR> <BR>Durahan knelt in a ring of dead Worm.  I took a step forward, almost tripping on a dead Worm, towards Durahan. <BR> <BR>Missing an arm, with several puncture wounds in his chest plate and leg armor, his helmet looked like it had been bitten once, and had a hole in it behind where his left eye would have been, if he were human.  Yet still, he held his sword, still looked ready to fight, as if he were taking just a moment to rest before his next swing. <BR> <BR>I knew that no monster could have taken so many wounds and live through it...  Yet, as Durahan turned his head towards me, I could almost imagine him smiling, giving me a &#39;it was nothing&#39; thumbs up with his left hand.  Slowly though, he pitched forward, a slow motion fall that would be his last.   <BR> <BR>The three of us were all there to help ease him to the ground.  Still, he held his sword, and looked into all our faces.  Mine, then Sarah&#39;s, then Angel&#39;s.  Angel blinked, as if something was said to her, and she ran back into the temple. <BR> <BR>&#39;Durahan...  Please, don&#39;t die.&#39;  I pleaded to him, knowing that the half dozen holes in his breastplate and the one in the back of his helmet told me nothing could save him now.  But I hoped, still. <BR> <BR>Angle came back quickly, with the remains of Durahan&#39;s left arm.  She knelt down, and placed the remains where they should have been, had Durahan been whole.  But to everyone&#39;s surprise, Durahan let go of his sword. <BR> <BR>Slowly, painfully, he reached across his body, and picked up the shoulder piece.  With a careful ease, he placed the empty piece of armor on my own left shoulder.  I felt the cool, solid, comfort of Durahan&#39;s body on my shoulder, as if it were a year ago, when I stood over the wounded Angel and started to panic.  But that wasn&#39;t all.  The cool metal against my shoulder started to contract, shrink, and then with a quiet, almost content sounding hiss, the metal shoulder guard remained on my shoulder, as Durahan reached over, and picked up his left gauntlet.  This, he held out to me. <BR> <BR>Without thinking, I put my hand in the metal glove.  It was, at first, too large for even my full grown hand.  But it too shrank.  Forming over my hand, becoming almost a second skin.  I looked into Durahan&#39;s eyes.  His hand coming up one last time to wipe a tear from the corner of my eye.  Then, with a deep throated sigh, the metal hand fell to the ground, and Durahan dissolved into a mist of blue motes. <BR> <BR>We stood, Sarah, Angel and I, around the lost disk.  The sun had set over the temple, and nightfall was swiftly approaching.  I turned, looking to my last two friends in the world.  &#39;We should get inside.&#39; <BR> <BR>Sarah and Angel nodded numbly, all our eyes red with tears.  As we turned to go, however, I felt a chill run down my spine.  The others did too, it seemed, as they both shivered and turned around. <BR> <BR>&#39;Miki...&#39;  Sarah started, her eyes going wide, Angel mimicking the look as well. <BR> <BR>Slowly I turned.  Maybe it was a Worm here to put me out of my misery and end this damned quest.  But...  It wasn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>Durahan&#39;s sword.  The two handed, broad bladed, ornate sword, was floating, point down, in front of me.  It surprised me further, when it spoke.  A firm, yet, still ghostly voice.  &#39;Durahan is dead.  But you are wrong in the assumption, that the dead can not help the living.&#39; <BR> <BR>We all blinked at the blade.  What we had thought of as a red &#39;gem&#39; on the cross piece, was now a small mouth, and it was speaking to us.  &#39;For you, he let go of his blade.  His fatigue, his enemies, and even his own fatal wounds, could not break his grip of me.  Yet, for you, he let go, willingly.&#39; <BR> <BR>A warm breeze blew by, my new red &#39;banner&#39; fluttered in the wind.  &#39;So to you, Miki Rudora, Shrine Chosen, wearer of Durahan, guardian of the guardian, I give my edge to you.&#39;  I blinked, and the gem closed over again.  The blade fell and buried it&#39;s point into the ground.  I stepped forward, and with my new left hand, pulled it out of the ground. <BR> <BR>&#39;It&#39;s true then.&#39;  Sarah said slowly, as I held the heavy blade in front of my face, examining it closely.  &#39;It is said that the sword of a Durahan is alive, and that he is cursed to hold it for his entire life.&#39; <BR> <BR>I put the blade over my shoulder without thinking, and again, the blade surprised me by sticking to my new metal shoulder guard, and slanting itself across my back comfortably.  &#39;I...  I think we need to get inside.&#39; <BR> <BR>Still feeling numb, we all walked into the shrine.  And again, the door closed behind us.  Sarah and I both looked to Angel, stepping over the Worm head, and looking around before noticing our looks. <BR> <BR>&#39;Well.  Where do we go from here?&#39;  Sarah asked, after I had made several attempts to ask myself. <BR> <BR>After a moment, Angel started walking down the hallway to the left.  It really was like the small temple.  Everything just seemed to be...  Bigger, more roomy.  Like it was meant to hold people, not just a shrine.  The floors were made of a blue marble, polished to a shine.  The walls were of what felt like granite, but I&#39;d never seen white granite before.  There didn&#39;t seem to be any windows, the light in the halls provided by soft glowing white strips about seven feet off the ground, and in the middle of the slightly curved ceiling, about nine feet off the floor.  It was almost like walking into a museum, after it had closed. <BR> <BR>Clean, but like a tomb. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR> <BR>Okay.  Again, I mist apolojize for the long silence.  I just couldn&#39;t get myself to write anything.  BUT, now, I have.  And it was kinda sad.  &#42;sniffle&#42;  But, here you go people.  ^_^ <BR> <BR>Hope I still have fans after this.  o.O

 I&#39;m still here. For now.... I hope your life gets so utterly boring that you pop out a few more chapters soon, I had to re-read the last one to remember what was going on! Good writing though =&#41;
