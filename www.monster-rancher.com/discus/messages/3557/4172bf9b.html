 Chapter 7: In Need <BR> <BR> <BR>	 <BR>Savont and Harvester stood on a featureless place.  They stood on a plain metal floor, and all around them stood a hungry blackness.  The two were positioned in a spotlight.   <BR> <BR>	“You failed me again, Savont,” a strong voice echoed. <BR>	“I… I am sorry, I will not…” Savont was cut off then. <BR>	“….fail next time?” mocked the voice.  Then Savont hesitated for a few seconds. <BR>	“Yes, I won’t, next time.” <BR>	“You sound as if I am in need of such arrogant service.  You are of no use to me anymore.  I am curious as to even why you came back, did you not see this coming?  Did you not know that I was going to deny your service? “ <BR>	“I can never leave business unfinished,” Savont sounded unsure. <BR>	“You don’t really expect me to believe you, do you?  You obviously don’t follow that to well.  You didn’t finish off Rancher or Geete.  I’ve had enough of your garbage.  Harvester, teach him a lesson which will last, then dispose of him in the wastes, to die.” <BR> <BR> <BR>	The dust cleared.  Killa Kan and Rancher stood inside a translucent blue shield that Killa Kan had erected right before the blast.  The place was nothing more then ruin on the inside.  The outer walls were barely standing.  A few mangled looking arms poked from underneath the rubble, Wes guessed they were those of the ranchers in the waiting room.  The blue shield slowly dissipated.    <BR> <BR>	“King!  Where is King at?” shouted Rancher as he ran toward where he guessed King would be.  Wes and Killa Kan were about to run over and help Rancher when they heard someone shout from under the rubble.  The group ran over to where they heard it from and cleared the rubble to see King’s bruised and bloody body.  The group was happy to see him but rejoice would have to come after they got him some help.  Rancher forgot about his wound for now, he’ll be able to tend to it later.  Also, where is Skippy? <BR> <BR>They managed to get King’s condition stabilized, and Rancher’s side wound bandaged, but now they were being be questioned from the constabulary about what happened at the stadium.   <BR> <BR>“So tell me,” began the constable,” where were you thirty minutes ago?” <BR>“At the stadium, that’s why you’re questioning us right?” Rancher asked. <BR>“Okay.  What were you doing there?” <BR>“We were attacked by a very powerful Joker monster and it’s trainer.” <BR>“Why were they attacking you?”  This made Rancher think.  He couldn’t tell the man the truth, that would differently get him in trouble.   <BR>“I don’t know,” Rancher said, surprised of his stupid answer.  <BR>“What was with the bullet holes in the wall?”  <BR>“The man was carrying a weird device that had the quickness of a hundred arqubueses,” Wes cut in. <BR>         <BR>         	After a series of more questions the constable finally decided to leave in search of any witnesses. <BR> <BR>The group looked all over the city for Skippy but couldn’t find any trace of him and no one had seen him either.  Rancher and Wes finally got to sleep and decided to head east now.  The tournament was to be held in another city, but then it was discovered that most of those ranchers that participated in the tournament were killed.  Wes kept all his questions to himself, figuring that Rancher didn’t want to be bothered after such a harsh day, besides he looked very angry, so Wes decided another time would be more appropriate.  <BR> <BR>In the morning they set off toward the east.  Rancher said that they’d find answers there in the deserts.  Wes always figured Rancher to have come from the deserts, as his skin was a dark tan color.  Wes on the other hand was fairly light skinned.  Wes wondered what Rancher meant by, “they’d find answers there”.  It didn’t sound so directed toward himself, but both of them.  <BR> <BR>“Project….” Wes whispered to himself.  Rancher heard him and said nothing.  He knew what it was.  He knew of Wes’ past, and his past was almost no different.  When he thought the time to be right, he’d till Wes everything he needed to know.  He wanted to right now, but he wanted to get back to the east first, then perhaps that will be enough.  Perhaps Rancher won’t have to tell Wes what happened.  Perhaps everything will work out as he hoped for.   <BR> <BR>“Abbadon,” Rancher thought to himself,” is he still alive, but how?  How is it possible for him to be alive?  And how could he be more powerful then Draco?  More powerful then Draco, is that possible?”  Wes looked up to see Rancher with a very concerned look on his face.   <BR> <BR>“Rancher, is there something…” Wes hesitated, so Rancher cut in. <BR>“Wrong?  No I’m fine, really, don’t worry about me,” Rancher felt a little comfort in Wes, and relaxed a bit. <BR> <BR>Rancher calculated that from their present position it’d take them at least two to three weeks for them to reach the Sunset valley, then from there it’d take them another week to reach Midnight Village, his home town.  Maybe if everything goes accord then they might have a chance to visit Abbadon at Dragon Cathedral.   <BR> <BR>Rancher knew he destiny awaited him there.  He knew that sooner or later he’d have to confront them: Savont, Abbadon, Churchwise, and Draco, and the others.  He figured he probably wouldn’t even be able to beat one of them.  Savont was the youngest of the group and he easily downed Rancher.  He would have been killed if it weren’t for Killa Kan. <BR>“I’m in need of help,” Rancher thought, or this will be the end of my existence, and they will continue their reign, and succeed.” <BR> <BR>-Nicholas D.
