 Part IV Preparation for The Spring Tournament <BR> <BR>I couldn’t wait to see what Thomas had written. I tore open the letter and it read: <BR> <BR>“Dear James, <BR>You’re welcome for the disc. Yeah, I knew that it would give you those monsters. How the disc was created, I don’t exactly know yet. If you want advice on training them, you only have to remember two things about each one. Always keep the Gitan busy, and have it do more Int. training than power. For the Ogyo, She will do whatever, unless it gets her dirty, and have her do more Pow. training. I can’t write much more, because I have to do something important. I’ll write you as soon as I can. <BR>Your friend, <BR>Thomas C. Marcus” <BR> <BR>Well, that answered a few questions and created a few more. At the moment, I could concentrate on that, for I had a tournament to win!  <BR> <BR>The day before the tournament was a nerve racking one for me. Devlin didn’t look like he even cared, which was usual for him. By now I had noticed their different personas. Devlin was very outgoing, opinionative, &#40;he couldn’t state his opinion, but he sure would show it!&#41; would never do anything he didn’t want to do unless Stefioni was there, and he could be slightly mischievous. Stefioni, on the other hand was quite, playful, would do anything I told her to do, always protective of Devlin, &#40;she would worry every time he left the house&#41; and could sometimes be a bit vain. I am told that this is the way these types of monsters acted. My, source, the Shrine Keeper, however, wasn’t always the best for knowledge. <BR> <BR>The walk to the tournament would take too long, so I hired a cab made up of a cabby and his Zuum; a very healthy one, might I add. On the way, we had a lunch consisting of nuts, &#40;Devlin’s favorite food&#41; shellfish, &#40;Stefioni’s favorite dish&#41; and a roast beef sandwich. &#40;My personal fav.&#41; <BR> <BR>We got there and headed toward the registration table. Once there, it looked as if Devlin would not fight unless Stefioni was with him. While I tried to explain to him that the rules would not permit it, one of the women at registration, showed us a notice stating: <BR> <BR>“As of today, monster battles that have more than one opponent on each side are permitted with the following groups: <BR>Galis and Jokers, Zuums and Tigers, Zans and Hengars, Golems and Gaboos, Mocchis and Suezos, Hares and Nagas, and finally, Gitans and Ogyos. More will be added soon. This is an official mandate of the Heads of the Monster Rule Committee.” <BR> <BR>“Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait! I can enter both of my monsters in a match?” I was totally taken aback. This did work out of me, though, since Devlin refused to fight without Stefioni. <BR> <BR>“Yes, that is true,” replied the woman at the registration desk, “All you have to do is sign them up here.” After she had sad this, she turned to one of the others working at the booth, and said something that caused both of their faces to lose their smile. Something was going on. I could feel it. As all of this was going through my head a voice was heard over the loud speakers: “Then next battle is Devlin the Pure Gitan and Stefioni the Pure Ogyo against Cat’s Eye the Marble Guy and Cookie Dough the Pure Gaboo! All contestants to your booths! The match will start in ten minutes!”  <BR> <BR>This was it! I was totally pumped! My faithful two and I were about to fight in our first match! Devlin and Stefioni, however, were perfectly calm… <BR>	 <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the next part, enjoy!

 Oops! Just noticed something when writing part VIII, when the list of monsters that can battle togther are read, there is a typo. It should go like this:  <BR> <BR>Galis and Jokers, Zuums and Tigers, Zans and Phoenixes, Golems and Gaboos, Mocchis and Suezos, Hengars and Mews, Hares and Nagas, and finally, Gitans and Ogyos. More will be added soon. This is an official mandate of the Heads of the Monster Rule Committee.” <BR> <BR>Sorry for the inconveniance.
