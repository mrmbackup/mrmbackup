 The largest dragon Roketh had ever seen walked slowly towards the two remaining monsters. He was purple for the most part, except for the faint shimmer of a silver material occasionally catching the eye. These were of some sort of machinery within the dragons limb&#39;s, no doubt strength enhancers. His wings closed around his body like a long, black robe. He stooped as Denemaur and Bloodlust stood side-by-side in front of him, both worn-out from the battle they just had. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Nightmare, Captain of the Vile Lords. I also lead a grand army at the moment. However, I need them not. Some are a bit troublesome. You will come with me, the easy way or the hard way.&#34; Nightmare said as he un-furled his massive wings. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am of the Eight Lords and I bow to no one!&#34; Bloodlust screamed. <BR> <BR>Denemaur stared at the dragon before finally saying, &#34;WATER HEAL!&#34;. The two became encased in two bubble-like structures. After a few minutes, the bubbles faded, unveiling the two. They were both fully-healed. <BR> <BR>Nightmare said with devilish delight, &#34;I guess this means you are going the hard way...good.&#34; <BR> <BR>The two began to circle the massive dragon, who stood in a very passive stance, as if neither one posed a true threat. The Durahan, Bloodlust, dove at the beast. Nightmare seemed to move in a blur to dodge the attack. The Pressure dove at him with an axe-handle attack from behind. Nightmare then took the fight to them. He dropped an elbow into the gut of the Pressure who charged his backside. Then, he flipped his fist up and nailed Denemaur in the face. Denemaur stumbled back as Nightmare turned. Bloodlust attempted another swipe. Nightmare bounded into the sky, his shadow falling over the Durahan. He tried to pull-off a stomp with all of his might. Bloodlust dodged as the dragon made a huge crater. He pounced out of it and landed on the Pressure, who had just regained his balance. Denemaur landed on his back and was straddled by Nightmare. The dragon raised his hand in the air. Bloodlust made a swing at the wrist, but Nightmare was always one step ahead. Pulling his wrist down, he fully extended his right leg into the chest of the Durahan. Bloodlust flew some twenty yards before sliding another ten. He was awe struck and scared when he looked at his chest. His diamond armour, was cracked. He looked up as the dragon attempted to kill Denemaur again. Bloodlust stood and new this would drain all of his energy, but it had to be done. Nightmare sensed something was wrong. As he turned, the Durahan had his sword in hand. He held the blade to his face and began to emit a slight yellow glow. He then dropped his sword&#39;s point to where it faced Nightmare. The sword itself seemed to burn with blueish fire. Denemaur came through at this point and hurled the dragon off of him. He saw Bloodlust and new he needed power. He held up his open hand towards the Durahan and began to raiate a brillant green. Nightmare watched on from between the two. The green aura fell into the Pressure&#39;s hand. It then shot with blinding speed towards the Durahan. It hit the Durahan with a lot of force, but Bloodlust didn&#39;t even move. His sword still pointed towards the dragon. <BR> <BR>The Durahan&#39;s glow fell upon the sword, which burned brighter then ever. The Durahan looked up at the dragon. Several seconds went by before he finally screamed, &#34;DRAIN WHIP!&#34;. <BR> <BR>A huge ray errupted from the sword. Nightmare put his hands on his hips and retracted his wings. He thought he&#39;d see what the Durahan could do. The pulsing beam hit him in the chest. The Durahan was sure that if he got the beast&#39;s power, he could surely win. Dust and rock flew around the point in which the beam met resistance. The beam grew smaller and more concentrated. <BR> <BR>&#34;I can feel the power, it is working!&#34; Bloodlust exclaimed. <BR> <BR>Then, the saw it. Nightmare stood in the same stance, in the same place. Directly behind him, a ground was in-lined with his shadow. However, on both sides and back from there was a deep ditch, dug by the parts of the beam that was not stopped by Nightmare&#39;s bulk. <BR> <BR>&#34;I say bravo, nice shot. So you like my power, eh?&#34; Nightmare said as he looked at his chest. The beam was still pulsing into it, sucking out his power. &#34;Not to worry, I have plenty. However, I have no time for games so, give it back.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, Nightmare grasped the beam with his right hand. The golden beam turned an eerie purple. Purple was indeed a color to suit Nightmare. Dark, dank, mysterious, and very evil looking in this instance. Denemaur could do nothing but look on in disbelief. The now purple beam ran through the yellow before eventually reaching the sword. Upon contact, a huge explosion let forth torwards Bloodlust. Purple rays shot through the dust at the impact point in the general direction of the Durahan. Bloodlust&#39;s screams were not natural. He was in an ungodly amount of pain, and no one knew what was happening to him. Another explosion rang forth from the end of the beam. Bloodlust&#39;s screams went silent. As Jace watched on in utter awe, half of the Durahan&#39;s golden sword landed before him. As he looked at this, the other half landed nearby, its diamond hilt still intact. The frightening thing was the fact that Bloodlust&#39;s right hand still clasped the handle. True fear rampaged through their bodies at this point. The dust settled and they saw what they thought could never come about. The once golden warrior lie in a crater filled with chips of gold and diamond. The body still smaoked and, except for the hand, was still intacted. He was sprawled out on his back, the front of his armour caved in. His diamond chest was know a hole, a black one. Amazingly he sat up. This was good, until they found out the could see the ground behind him. The blast cut through not one, but two plates of diamond armour. He was alive, but in no condition to fight. <BR> <BR>&#34;TYPOON CRUSHER!&#34; Echoed through Jaces head. As he turned, he saw Denemaur had his palms in the general direction of Nightmare. He did not know his friend was alive and thus, was enraged. The column of horizontal water nailed Nightmare as soon as he turned. The water then curved upward, with Nightmare on the top of it. It began to spin, and then turned into a full-fledged storm. This one dwarfed the previous one he had done to Dragonaught. After several minutes, Denemaur could not keep him up anymore. He lowered his hands and the strom subsided. Nightmare was on his back, and lay still. The Pressure then walked over to him and stood over his body. <BR> <BR>&#34;For the honor.&#34; He said as he slowly walked away. <BR> <BR>Before he made it to the crater that Bloodlust was in, a sickening laugh rang through the battlefield. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fool!&#34; Nightmare screamed as he nailed the Pressure in the back with his knee. <BR> <BR>Denemaur fell on his face. He turned to see Nightmare standing there, virtually untouched. He looked over and Nightmare&#39;s body began to disappear into a strong wind. He looked up at the Dragon that stood over him. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Nightmare, Lord of Illusions. I hereby proclaim that any who dare go against Kingston will be destroied. With the eight of you out of the way, his path will be a simle one.&#34; <BR> <BR>Nightmare placed his palm upon the Pressure&#39;s forhead. Denemaur began to scream as the surronding area faded into a purple sunset. He grabbed Nightmare&#39;s arm, trying to release himself. Nightmare was too strong. All seemed to be lost. <BR> <BR>Then, a thunderous voice rang out, &#34;MULTI-ELEMENT ATTACK!&#34;. Vyger had steped onto the battlefield. Nightmare released his grip to turn and face his third opponent. The massive Hydra stomped and sent earth rings torwards the dragon. Each head used a differant element. One shot fire from its nostrils, another shot an ice beam from its mouth, and the middle one had a lightning bolt errupting from its horn. The elements smashed into the dragon. Vyger stopped when he believed Nightmare was defeated, at this point Roketh and Jace had joined him. When the smoke cleared, Nightmare still stood tall. <BR> <BR>&#34;Perfect timing. You arrived right after my warm-up bout.&#34; Nightmare stated with his trademark grin. <BR> <BR> <BR>Enjoy! CHB
