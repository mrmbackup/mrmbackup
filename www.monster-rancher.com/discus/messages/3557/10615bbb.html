<B>The Goddess of Blue Lake</B> <BR> <BR>The cold winter air seeped through my heavy coat as I trod through the snow that day. I was headed for Blue Lake on my annual ice-fishing trip. I was all alone accept for the burrowing hoppers who’s heads occasionally popped up out of the snow, sniffing the air for the scent of food. The whole lake was frozen over and you could see the tiny schools of fish and Nitons swimming peacefully in unison. I unloaded my backpack and pulled out my fishing gear. A long, sturdy fishing-pole, and some sweet jellies for bait. I walked out onto the lake and dug a small hole about the size of a garbage can lid into the ice. I cast in my line and waited. The day went by slowly and blissfully and soon the sun began to fall behind the mountains casting a shadow over the lake. I had been skunked, but I didn’t care. It was the sheer relaxation that drove me to this isolated spot each winter. I packed up my things and prepared for the long walk home. That’s when I heard it. The shrill piercing howl of a white tiger. I knew from books that all wild tigers hunted in packs and I also knew that they were known for their man-eating tendencies and vicious dispositions. I was in no hurry to be a tiger’s dinner. I hoisted up my backpack and started running as fast as I could towards the shore and home. When I had just about reached the lake edge my foot hit thin ice and plummeted through. I tried to pick it up and continue running but my foot was lodged in the ice and I was hopelessly stuck. I turned around and to my horrible dismay saw six white tigers racing across the ice in my direction. Their teeth were bared and they were all glaring ominously.  They didn’t look like they were coming to help me. They were fifty, forty, thirty feet away from me, and gaining fast. I closed my eyes and prepared to be ripped limb from limb. Just then a miracle happened. Through the ice a beautiful Nagisa lake pixie emerged. She had deep blue eyes and a crystal body that glimmered in the last rays of the sun. She raised her right hand in the air and the ice on which the tigers were standing began to crack. Then the ice gave way and the six tigers plunged to a frozen grave. The Nagisa turned to me and whispered the word “Keenay.” My foot was instantly loosened from the ice and I pulled it out. I looked up at the pixie to thank her but she had already disappeared under the water. As I walked toward my cabin that night I knew that I would never forget my encounter with the Nagisa, goddess of Blue Lake.    <BR>.
