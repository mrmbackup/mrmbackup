 Here&#39;s the next part. Made it extra long for the few who read it. <BR> <BR> <BR>Part VI Questions Answered and More Created <BR> <BR>I was so nervous; I was about to have a breakdown. I didn’t want Devlin and Stefioni to get hurt. I thought about disqualifying myself, but Devlin and Stefioni were so determined that I thought it best to not. We made our way to the ring as before, but something was different. It was like I could feel loss. Stefioni saw that I was depressed and did what she normally did to cheer me up: tie Devlin’s ears into a bow. This made him so silly and angered that I just had to laugh. The feeling was gone, and I actually felt like we had a chance. <BR> <BR>Trumpets blew and the loud speakers blared. “This is the match that will decide who moves on to rank E. The Final Match of the Spring Tournament begins in 60 seconds. Breeders and monster, be at the ready!” I saw Gavin for the first time up close. He looked sort of comical, being so short with his long, curly auburn hair, but his face had a look that demanded respect. <BR> <BR> His monsters were nothing of formidable. Galiant was the physical form of light. He just floated there, not saying a word, doing every thing master told him. Any breeder would be in awe just to be close to such a magnificent monster. Raffiel, on the other hand, was what nightmares were made of. Jokers are so ruthless and treacherous that most are too scared to breed them, but this one would just sit there, every once in a while would chuckle a laugh that sent strong shivers through you back. <BR> <BR>The gong was rung and the match began. “Go ahead, make the first move James,” Gavin called out to me.  <BR> <BR>“Wait,” I thought. “How did he know name?” <BR> <BR>“There are a lot of things I know that you don’t!” he said, as if breaking into my thoughts and reading them. “Since you refuse to make the first move, I guess I must. Galiant, attack the fish with a giant blow. Raffiel, cut that mutated bunny rabbit to pieces!” There was a horrible glint in his eye.  <BR> <BR>Stefioni easily dodged the blow, while Devlin parried Raffiel’s scythe. “Ok, ok, I can fight too. WATCH! Devlin, Stefioni, give Galiant The Fried Fish!” This is what I called the combination move that they did to Hannah’s monsters. <BR> <BR>Devlin shot the bolt of lightning at Stefioni, and she charged at Galiant with all her might. She came in contact with Galiant, and a blinding flash, just like the one at the shrine, shot out from the two monsters. When all had faded, the Ogyo and the Gali were locked in mortal combat, surrounded by a barrier of light. <BR> <BR>“Huh. Just as I predicted.” Gavin had a look of triumph on his face, as if he had already won the match. <BR> <BR>“What are you talking about?” I was so bewildered. In all my years of assisting with Thomas, I had never encountered something like this. <BR> <BR>“Don’t you know?” He talked like he was better than me. “The Ogyo and the Gitan share the same relationship ad the Gali and the Joker: light and dark. The two of the light alignment, if of the same strengths, cannot defeat one another; same as with the dark. Only together can the other be defeated, and obviously, your monsters have yet to master only one of the Soul Attacks. Only certain monsters, when put together, can perform these attacks. They come from the soul of the monsters working together. Although, I see that your monsters figured out how to do it without your help. Hahaha! That humors me. <BR> <BR>“Wait, do you mean these soul monsters are the ones on the list?” <BR> <BR>“Humph. You catch on quick for one so, so, inexperienced. Yes, that’s the word. I pity you, so ignorant to what is really behind your twin monsters, what makes them act like they do; so obedient, so caring for each other and you, and even why they are here. You see, there are many Ogyos and Gitans, but few are soul monsters, which are twins from discs. Still, I wonder why Thomas gave you such a precious gift. Alas, I don not know what he saw in you. Oh well, he always acted with his heart instead of his mind.” <BR> <BR>“How do you know Thomas? How do you know all that you do? Dual monster battles were just approved. I demand to know!” <BR> <BR>“You will know soon enough, soon enough, but first…what? ARGH!!!” Suddenly, a huge Diabolos appeared, grabbed Gavin and flew off. Galiant and Raffiel immediately gave chase after them. Out of nowhere a man came into view.  <BR> <BR>“OK. That’s four of the Soul Masters down. Ah, my young James. I’m glad that we have finally met. My name is Jacques. Now, would you kindly hand over your two beautiful monsters? For I am in great need of them.” <BR> <BR>“You will never lay a hand of them. What have you done with Gavin? Are you in on this seemingly huge secret that I have be so conveniently left out?” This retort made him angered, but he did not show it on his face. <BR> <BR>“Ah, you will not give up willingly, then I will have to use force!” He made a noise that sounded like Dragons speaking to one another. His Diabolos came flying back at an incredible speed not normal for a dragon. “This is my Diabolos, Xavier. You’ve met him, haven’t you? Xavier, attack! BWAHAHAHAAAAA!!!” The dragon was just about upon us, when we were surrounded by some sort of field, and then everything went black. <BR> <BR>I awoke to Devlin on my bed and Stefioni next to it. Both were staring, which was like every morning. It felt as if everything had been a dream, and that’s what I thought it was. I was wrong, for then, a woman came in and introduced herself as Kari.  <BR> <BR>“Where am I?” I asked. <BR> <BR>“First, I must tell how you got here,” she answered.
