 Fate is confusing.  It knots itself around itself, floats around and takes shortcuts to the greater good or evil.  This was an extremely important event.  It was very unlikely to go perfectly.  There was a one in a million chance that the angry outsiders would meet, there was a one in a million chance that the ship would be heading roughly the direction of earth, there was a one in a million chance that the angry outsiders had the transport needed to travel at exactly the right speed to be in a certain place at the right time, there was a one in a million chance that the ship would crash into the sea and be near enough the angry outsiders for them to go on board, there was a one in a million chance that the angry outsiders would involve a Durahan who&#39;s eyes lit up when he was over come by his own mind and would make them follow him through the ship to exactly the right point before Fate was going to kill Kain.   <BR> <BR>However when Fate is involved the less likely something is to happen the more often it does.  One in a million chances happen nine times out of ten.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Stop!&#34; The voice was strange.   <BR> <BR>Fate span around and faced the six creatures.  Kain was confused and could not tell whether the creatures were friendly to him or not.  Bolt was beeping quietly in the corner.  The six figures were varying in size and shape.  They were poised ready to attack Fate but had not yet advanced.   <BR> <BR>&#34;We are the angry outsiders.&#34; Camelot the durahan echoed. <BR> <BR>&#34;I know, I knew you would come here. Trust me when I say that you lose, I am fate itself, why would I bother battling at all if I was going to lose.&#34; She smiled as she said this. <BR> <BR>The creatures did not look in the slightest bit put off.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Whether you know us or not, a proper introduction is necessary.  I am Camelot.  The first angry outsider.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Garth.  The second angry outsider.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Tarn.  The third angry outsider.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Flience.  The fourth angry outsider.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Darth.  The fifth angry outsider.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Neos. The sixth angry outsider.&#34; <BR> <BR>As they spoke up they stepped forward.  They were all looking angry especially the durahan who&#39;s eyes were glowing blood red.  They were staring at Fate.  She was considering this and then let out a laugh.  She turned to completely face them.  Her back was turned.   <BR> <BR>Bolt beeped.  It was looking both sad and terrified. Kain looked at it, there had to be a way to get down.  He looked at the chains holding his arms.  They were not that thick.  He whistled quietly and Bolt looked at him.  He motioned to Bolt&#39;s sting then to the chains.  Bolt understood straight away.  He slowly walked up eyeing Fate nervously.  Then he extended his sting.  It chipped a way silently into the metal.  It would take a while but it would work.  As long as the creatures in the room kept talking. Fate laughed again then pointed at Camelot. <BR> <BR>&#34;You call yourselves outsiders.  It is your excuse.  Your way of hiding the immense guilt you find on yourselves.  You are not outsiders.  You are scum.&#34; <BR> <BR>Flience formed a gatling gun on his hand and aimed it slowly in full view, he looked incredibly angry.   <BR> <BR>&#34;The Knight.&#34; She hissed pointing at the duruhan. <BR> <BR>&#34;The Murderer.&#34; She spat at the draco moochi. <BR> <BR>&#34;The Thief.&#34; She hissed at the bowwow. <BR>&#34;The Soldier.&#34; She spat at the purple jell. <BR> <BR>&#34;The Traitor.&#34; She hissed at the ragnoracks. <BR> <BR>&#34;The Rebel.&#34; She spat at the automaten. <BR> <BR>All the monsters looked angry, but still targeted and focused.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Especially you Flience.&#34;  It hissed as an after thought.   <BR> <BR>Camelot lifted his sword and leapt at Fate.  She didn&#39;t even flinch as the huge blade dug into an invisible barrier.  It made a sound like a single drop of water falling from a cave roof.  Camelot flew backwards.   <BR> <BR>&#34;This is the barrier, Destiny was made from this&#34; she called over her shoulder. <BR> <BR>&#34;Nothing will penetrate it!&#34;  <BR> <BR>Flience was getting angrier and angrier.  His fists were clenched and the two monsters either side of him, Tarn and Darth, had started to notice. <BR> <BR>&#34;You are the scum, murderers, killers, deserters and the dregs of society.  You are the worst of the world.  You are the most human of monsters.&#34;  She hissed to the whole group. <BR> <BR>Bolt slowly chinked through the last chain and Kain fell to the floor like a ninja.  He suddenly thought.  Why didn&#39;t Fate react?  She knew what was going to happen.  He ran and unchained Detan and Zack.  Both were on the borders of consciousness and just lay on the floor where he dragged them. <BR> <BR>Fate slowly turned to face Flience and daggered him with her red eyes. <BR> <BR>&#34;Madness is no excuse for killing a friend. A real friend would work through the madness.&#34; <BR>Flience lost it.  The angry outsiders, Fate plus Kain watched as Flience slowly changed color.  The purple of his body seemed to melt inside him leaving a clear jell.  The purple was floating within him now, floating around, up and down his body.  The place where his eyes should be was swamped with bright red and white glowing light.  His base was melting the metal floor below him.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Blood feast!&#34; He said in a voice that was not his. <BR> <BR>Tarn turned to the others looking scared. <BR> <BR>&#34;The blood feast, it was a long running disease.  Along time ago some jells had a condition known as blood lust that increased their power amazingly for a limited time and then they died.  The blood feast is like that I think.  Flience is going to go mad and try and kill Fate.  When he runs out of natural energy he will die.  Do not get in the way, he cant see who he is attacking.&#34;  He said quickly. <BR> <BR>Flience had paused slightly but now he focused his eyes on Fate.  Kain and Bolt watched from the side of Fate.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Nothing can penetrate this barrier.&#34; Fate shouted.  It was amazing to hear Fate sounding scared. <BR> <BR>Flience seemed to expand, grow. He suddenly turned both hands into gatling guns. His shoulders extended and turned into flyswatters, his stomach extended into multiple weapons on tendrils.  He laughed manically then there was a burst of light.  His guns were firing with lightning speed.  The barrier was rippling and sparking as Fate flinched repeatedly behind it.  It sounded like a thunderstorm as the other weapons went to work slapping against the barrier. The guns slowed then stopped, the tendrils returned to Flience&#39;s body.  Then he launched a powerful stab attack with all his anger behind it.  There was a sound like breaking glass and the barrier was gone.  Flience slowly sunk down into a clear puddle then his normal hue returned. <BR> <BR>There was a short space of time where no one dared move then the duruhan looked up at Fate.  He jumped forward in huge bounds, his sword drawn.  With that Tarn, Garth, Neos and Darth charged.  Fate took the first slash and fell back a little. Tarn leapt forward and kicked Fate in the chest.  The creature managed to block a lying tackle by the huge body of Darth and threw the dragon over its head.  A rolling tackle hit him in the leg and a red beam of energy from Neos&#39;s cannon hit him in the shoulder.   <BR> <BR>Kain watched with amazement, as Fate seemed to melt.  He was not being killed but it seemed to be some form of battle mode.  She grew a tail, her legs shortened and her mouth extended into a short snout.  She swung round and smashed Garth away with her tail.  Darth launched a stream of fire at her back and she fell forward. Tarn leapt up and uppercut Fate&#39;s snout.   <BR> <BR>&#34;You cannot win!&#34;  <BR> <BR>Fate leapt over them and turned.  Her mouth opened and a bright light appeared at the end.  Camelot leapt to the front of the group and held his shield up to defend from the beam of light that rocketed at them.  The shield took the blow and Camelot strained to keep the shield extended.  <BR> <BR>Fate hissed then snarled at something no one could see.  She hissed. <BR> <BR>&#34;No! It can&#39;t be!&#34;  <BR> <BR>Her eyes were yellow with rage.  She jumped up into the air and blew a jet of fire at the group.  Camelot tried to defend again but was pushed back.  Neos ran from behind the shield and tried to shoot Fate.  The blast of laser hit but Neos fell to the ground as Fate&#39;s fist fired a beam of light straight at the bronze robot.   <BR> <BR>One creature was down.  Slowly and steadily the others were knocked out beside him.  After a while only Camelot still stood.  He was more smashed up than he normally looked. His shield was burnt, his armour black and cracked.  Sparks were flying from his helmet.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Except it. I have won!&#34; Said a bleeding mouth.  <BR> <BR>Fate was looking just as bad.  She had deep wounds all over her body.  Her eyes were blood red and sparking nastily.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Never.&#34; <BR> <BR>Camelot ran forward with his sword lifted.  Kain saw it before Camelot did.  A beam of light collecting on the Demons fist.  Camelot saw it shoot off and tried to lower his shield.  All three of them knew it was too late.  Kain jumped in the beams path with a fist extended. It was hard to tell what happened.  The beam sort of collected and bent around Kain&#39;s hand.  The ball of energy hit Fate and she flew backwards.  Sparks jumped off Faiths body and hit Kain back.  He landed on Bolt. Fate stood up and spat blood from his mouth.  Then there was a blinding light. <BR> <BR>Bolt and Kain were floating in the air.  Orbiting each other.  Light was bouncing between them and all around them.  Slowly they pulled together and melded.  Both Camelot and Fate had stopped and were watching.  A glowing figure of a human appeared.  Then it faded.  Kain stood there.  Arms apart legs at shoulder width, floating.  Suddenly his hands were coated in metal.  Pincers replaced the fingers, golden thick pincers with fist like patterns on them. His legs were coated in metal with giant gold shin guards.  The top half of his head was covered with a helmet.  It was the top half of a renocraft, the eye and golden crest.  He slowly lowered to the ground and landed with a huge crash.  He moved into a ready to attack stance and two giant metal wings shot out from his shoulders. <BR> <BR>Fate opened his mouth and blasted a huge ball of fire.  It hit full on and the flames surrounded the angel like being.  The giant fire ball continued to roll over Kain&#39;s armored body and as it did a beam of light shot out from his chest.    It flew into the air and paused.  Fate stopped the giant flamethrower and concentrated on the beam.  It split into three rays, then each of those split in half.  Six rays began circulating the room flying in circles.  Suddenly one veered off and shot into Tarn&#39;s body.  He shot up.  He looked around and then turned with astonishment to face the angel.  The beams continued to go around shooting into the bodies and waking them up.  They rose slowly and carefully then turned and waited.  The last beam shot into Camelot and his shield was no longer burned, his armor was the correct shape and his helmet no longer dented.   <BR> <BR>Fate screamed miserably and then stood frozen as Kain flew silently towards it.  A beam of blue shot out and hit the demon encasing it in ice.   <BR> <BR>&#34;I am now going to leave you.  I am technically dead, both Bolt and me cannot return to our own bodies.  I am Ambition.  Enemy of Fate.  Ambition is the only thing that can stop fate from taking its course and   you all have great ambition, as did I.  Now I must go. &#34;  The angel spoke to a room of silence then turned and shrunk into a golden beam.   <BR> <BR>He shot out at the frozen statue and both Fate and Ambition were gone.  The ice shattered and fell to the floor.  Kain was dead.  The angry outsiders looked around and tried to think of what to do.  Suddenly Tarn shouted. <BR> <BR>&#34;Flience!&#34;   <BR> <BR>Flience was still in a puddle on the floor.  They ran over and Darth dipped a deep claw into the purple slime.   <BR> <BR>&#34;This jell is still alive, somehow, but not able to change from this form.&#34; <BR> <BR>They carried the puddle, plus the knocked out bodies of Zack, Detan and Fierce from the ship and got back onto the boat. It had carried them to the ship in the first place and with what seemed instinct Garth steered it around and head for where they had came.  The ship sunk into the misty depths behind them as they left. <BR> <BR>Fate had been proven wrong.  But life doesn’t end with an adventure.  They led on with their lives.  With what will always be remembered by them.  In memory of Kain.  The aftermath.     <BR> <BR>The last ever Kain saga will follow this story.  I have not decided whether to do it all as one or separate it into different bits.  Please give feedback on the climax of the Kain saga.

 Hmmm, hmmm, I do like this. However, it seems rather Crono Crossish. Not that its bad, but Fate is a villin most games/stories have. <BR> <BR>In any event, great job elaberating on fate&#39;s disposition. I must admit, the melding sequence was pretty clean though, but, in a sense, anti-climactic. <BR> <BR>Overall, I really enjoy this epic. I suppose I&#39;ll start a new one after a while. Right now I&#39;m still playing with a charactor set-up, but more so, a title. Nice addition though, truely inspireing.
