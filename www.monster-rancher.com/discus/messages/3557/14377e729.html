 King Convectus stared out the window in his chamber. He did not like what he saw. Soldiers marched in lines down to the battlefield, meanwhile medics were pushing in carts piled with the bodies of the fallen, and to make matters worse the civillians were beginning to panic. Convex shook his head. Things were not going well. He had fought many wars in his time, he had even been a general before he was chosen to be king, but leading the people during wartime was a very hard thing to do. <BR> <BR>He hopped towards the center of the room and began pacing as fast as his Suezo leg would carry him. Why were the forest monsters, who had been peaceful for years, suddenly start a fight with his people? The thought entered his head again. It made no sense. Perhaps Darktalon had caused some kind of disturbance, he knew his friend well. He was violent, yes, but he wasn&#39;t stupid, he wouldn&#39;t attack unless provoked, albiet slightly. Suddenly he wondered if Darktalon and Naharud had succeded in reaching the crash site that bothered him a few nights ago, it seemed like a memory now. More importantly he wondered if they were alright. Lifes were far more important than a fireball from the heavans, especially if they belonged to those he cared about. He went over to his throne and sat down, still pondering, when his chamber doors burst open. <BR> <BR>&#34; My lord,&#34; a Raiden entered the room. He was dressed from head to toe in full body armor, a redish golden badge shone on his chest, signifiying his status. Clutching his side was a long sword. He bowed close to Convex&#39;s throne, kneeling on his long, slende, talon-like legs. &#34;I bring you news.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Is it good news or bad news, Liutenant Wellington,&#34; Convex said. Wellington opened his beak to speak, but Convex went on. &#34;Because if it is bad news, then you can save it. I have enough on my hands at the moment.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;But, my liege. It&#39;s about Captain Naharud!&#34; At this Convex leaped from his seat. <BR> <BR>&#34;What is it, tell me!&#34; Convex was shaking, especially since the Raiden hadn&#39;t specified whether or not he wanted to hear what he had to say. <BR> <BR>&#34;Last night, we sent a small sqaudron of Hares deep into the forest to do scouting. While hiding in the shadows, they reported seeing a large hulking creature, a Wood Golem if I&#39;m not mistaken, lumbering through the forest.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s a forest, what, pray tell, is so interesting about a Wood Golem?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;If you&#39;ll let me continue my lord.&#34; Convex rolled his eye, Wellington did love telling a good story. Convex sometimes wondered why he didn&#39;t become an author instead of Naharud&#39;s liutenant. He wished he get to the point. &#34;What intrigued the Hares was not the Wood Golem itself, but what it was carrying. &#39;In its clutches&#39; the Hare said to me, he said. &#39;In its clutches I could see a small monster. When it moved a bit closer into the light I could make out the distinct armor of the Captian, and I could also see another monster... but it weren&#39;t movin&#39;.&#39;&#34; Convex sank back into his chair, his mouth agape. Could a Wood Golem actually have overpowered his Captain of the Gaurd and best friend at the same time? &#34;But that&#39;s not all your honor, no.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;W-what more could there possibly be?&#34; he asked stricken. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, the Hare, Quinto his name was, followed the beast for a few minutes... and then it dissapeared.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;How could he lose track of a Golem?!&#34; Convex asked, beggining to doubt his own troops. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh he didn&#39;t lose its trail, sire, it literally vanished. It took a few moments for Convex to let that sink in.  <BR> <BR>&#34;How-&#34; he began when the doors burst open agian. An armored Zuum scampered into the room. He looked stricken. He didn&#39;t even bother to salute or bow.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Liutenant Wellington, the Forest millitia has breached the city walls! They used Wood Golems, of which they had more in number than first believed, to break a section of the wall, and now monsters are pouring into the streets!&#34; Convex and Wellington both jumped.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll be right there. You go ahead, soldier. Organize a group to evacuate the civillians.&#34; The Zuum left. Wellington got up and headed for the door. &#34; We&#39;ll try to root &#39;em out sire, but-&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34; Fetch me my armor.&#34; Wellington thought he misheared for a second.  <BR> <BR>&#34;But sire! You can&#39;t-&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That is an order Liuetenant! Do not defy your king!&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Y-yes sire... as you command.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>It was a near miss. Jeslin had just turned around and nearly had his throat slit by the claws of a wild dragon. He jumped back and stared into its cold, killer eyeys. He ducked as the dragon swong again and picked up his fallen sword off of the ground. He rose and slashed his sword at the dragon&#39;s underside, piercing his tough scaley hide. The dragon let out a furious screech. Wasting little time, the Mocchi pulled back his fist and amied a Thrust at the hilt of his sword. The force of the Thrust pushed the sword deep into the Dragon&#39;s now bare skin, the tip of the hilt barely visible. The Dragon stood still for a moment, coughing up blood. Then it toppled over, stone dead. Jeslin withdrew his sword from its carcass. <BR> <BR>He suddenly felt the air get colder at his bakc side . He rolled into a ball, and flung himself to the side just as the Ice Bomb whizzed over his head. He turned full circle and rolled forcefully into the Tiger that fired the deadly bal of ice. The Tiger flew in the air and slammed into a nearby building. Enraged it got up, and was preparing to charge when it got impaled by the large claws of a massive Rocklon. <BR> <BR>&#34;You alrigh&#39; Jeslin?&#34; the Beaclon/Golem asked. Jeslin breathed a sigh of relief. It was the first friendly face he had seen in the confusion. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, Raoc. I&#39;m just fine. Thanks for the save. Nice moves, I guess I taught you well.&#34; Jeslin was in charge of training the new recruits in the Monstrian army. <BR> <BR>&#34; Naw, them&#39;s just plain skill.&#34; Jeslin burst out laughing. It wasn&#39;t that funny, but it was just the thing that he needed. Roac looked around. I think this section&#39;s cleared, sir.&#34; Jeslin glanced at the main street. It was the first time he had time to since he started fighting. Bodies, both friendly and non, were lining the street, but none but he and Roac seemed to be standing. &#34;Should we go join the others?&#34; He had a look of depression on his face. <BR> <BR>&#34;Not yet soldier, sit down. I need a break.&#34; Roac&#39;s face lit up. He moved closer to Jeslin and sat down. <BR> <BR>&#34; That&#39;s jus&#39; wat I wanted ter&#39; hear, boss.&#34;
