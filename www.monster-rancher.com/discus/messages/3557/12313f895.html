 &#34;Why.&#34; The crystal zan&#39;s voice cut a harsh path through the night air. <BR> <BR>&#34;He will kill me if i tell you.&#34; The man sat in a chair, covered in his own blood. <BR> <BR>&#34;Who?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Your creator.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;.....&#34; <BR> <BR>The seven creatures around the man all had their faces wound up tight in puzzlement. &#34;I was created by Nate. You know that.&#34; the zan spoke in tones of disbelief at the man&#39;s words. <BR> <BR>&#34;I cannot say any more.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We will kill you if you don&#39;t tell us anyway..&#34; growled the dragon in the corner. <BR> <BR>&#34;And it WILL be painful,&#34; added the tiger. <BR> <BR>&#34;What will happen to me if I tell you?&#34; questioned the man. <BR> <BR>&#34;We&#39;ll give u a less painful death.&#34; <BR> <BR>The man shuddered. A few hours ago he had been a prominent traitor to these monsters. A few hours ago his name would have mattered to him. Not anymore. All the man cared for was the best way to be released from his world of sins. <BR> <BR>&#34;We must start at the beggining.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Fine with me.&#34; <BR> <BR>------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>&#34;You started out as his ultimate creation. Your real name is case # 31694. Otherwise known as Guardianna. Your name transalates to &#39;The Guard of The Circle&#39; in an unkown language discovered on a small island where monsters do not live in discs. You were supposed to be the ultimate monster, a zan fused with genetically enhanced living glass. As tough as a few golems and durahans mixed together. As powerful as many, many dragons combined. As fast as a suezo in midteleport and then multiplied by ten. As intelligent as a human with over 200 IQ. As adept at all forms of fightning as the best in each type. <BR> <BR>However, when he made you he was quite paranoid about competitors stealing his ultimate creation. So he made different weapons and gear that would bond to you and awaken a different power in you. <BR> <BR>A red sheild, called the tripolic sheild, which will awaken the defense in your skin. <BR> <BR>A red sword, the Durandal. It means &#39;The Knight&#39;s Blade&#39; in the language of your name. <BR> <BR>A red pair of boots, aptly named &#39;secure feet.&#39; It increases ur speed 1000 fold. <BR> <BR>The last two, intelligence and experience, are found in a special red heart that only your maker has. It can change shape but often takes the form of a red eagle. <BR> <BR>Without these 4 items, you are simply an unnatural looking ordinary zan. You have the same capabiliteis of any zan. It is only your good breeding that makes you powerful. <BR> <BR>It is said that there was a raid on the lab by a competitor in the &#39;rule the world&#39; buisness. You were stolen and put with a nobody breeder. 3 of your parts, the Durandal, tripolic sheild, and secure feet, were hidden across the continent. They didn&#39;t predict, however, that you would grow to become #1 in the world and your owner would become noticed. <BR> <BR>Now your maker has come to get you back. If he cannot convince you to join him, he will destroy you. He has crafted an equal to you, one with better spirit weapons. <BR> <BR>Your twin has a kasami bracer instead of a trpolic sheild. They are about equal. <BR> <BR>He has an elysion against your durandal. His elysion is a holy blade, used by angels. It is extremely powerful, much more so than your blade. <BR> <BR>He has secure feet, so you two are equal in speed. <BR> <BR>The only thing lacking in him is your experience and intelligence. They cannot make your key fit his, so they made a new one. However, yours was just a freak accident in the flask, and as such your twin is severely lacking against you in that regard. <BR> <BR>Your maker lives in a secret cave in the Icefree desert. You must find all your secret garments and get your red eagle key before you face him. Be prepared for a fight.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;But...who is my maker?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That will be quite enough.&#34; <BR> <BR>The dart embedded itslef in the man and he slumped over in the seat, dead.
