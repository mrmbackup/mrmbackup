 Sundown and 0446 was nowhere to be found.  Most monsters were left alone to their own interests if they did not want to be located, but Jorus needed Henger 0446.  To observe the cycles of October&#39;s moon, 0446 needed to be at the ranch at all times.  There had been a problem when trying to locate the Henger disc stones over the past few years, and as such 0446 was the last Henger Jorus had raised in nearly nine years.  Perhaps... <BR> <BR>Fearing the worst, Jorus went to the stables, where most of the monsters were resting and tending to their personal needs.  Strolling down the center aisle, he could see the Tigers preening themselves as well as the Golems--peaceful slumbering hulks.  Nearing his destination, he heard the distinctive sound of a whetstone.  Being used. <BR> <BR>There, on his right, was his Durahan, Taerusu.  Taerusu had been personally trained by Jorus in the arts of battle.  Over the years he had collected a rather extensive knowledge of fighting techniques.  If he ever needed to deal with a monster--such as the first Joker he raised--he would be able to end the terror.  His Durahan, Taerusu, was there for much the same reason.  It was to guard the monsters, even from themselves.  And now he needed Taerusu, just in case his suspicions were right.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Taerusu?&#34; <BR> <BR>It looked up momentarily, then returned to sharpening his blade.  It was a Katana that would grow with Taerusu&#39;s age.  It had stopped when Taerusu began to feast on the Golden Peaches; otherwise, it would at one time reach the moon.   <BR> <BR>The fact that Taerusu had looked up at him showed that he had acknowledged Jorus&#39;s presence.  This also meant that he was listening.   <BR> <BR>&#34;I need you, for a few hours.&#34; <BR> <BR>It stopped sharpening its blade and spoke.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Where will we be going, master?&#34; <BR> <BR>Pointing to the side of the ranch facing sundown, he replied, &#34;To the last place we broke ground.&#34; <BR> <BR>Solemnly, Taerusu stepped out of his stable and headed out.  Slipping in Taerusu&#39;s &#34;Out&#34; card, Jorus began to follow him, only to be stopped by one of the Tigers that stood watch.  It was named &#34;Corsti.&#34;   <BR> <BR>&#34;Sir?&#34; <BR> <BR>Looking down, Jorus saw that the Tiger seemed anxious, if not worried.  &#34;Yes, Corsti?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Umm, Saven and I were patrolling earlier today and saw those men from the smithy guild wandering about the ranch borders.  They were close too...  well, you know.&#34; <BR> <BR>And Jorus did, which gave him all the more reason to hurry along.  In a few minutes, the sun would slip behind the horizon and then Jorus would REALLY have something to worry about.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Much thanks, Corsti.  And give my regards to Saven.&#34;   <BR> <BR>&#34;N&#39; you, master.  Good luck finding Henger...&#34; <BR> <BR>Hurrying towards Taerusu, Jorus fingered the hilt of his blade.  If it came to that, the smithy guild&#39;s members would pay dearly.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Forgive me, master, but it has been a while since I visited Daht-Sieg.  How much further until we reach him?&#34; <BR> <BR>He would never forget... <BR> <BR>&#34;Straight ahead, for five minutes, until we hit the river.  Then, follow it to the west until we reach Kyn Valley.  Across the river, there...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Forgive me for asking, but could we not simply cut northwest?&#34;   <BR> <BR>Sighing, Jorus replied, &#34;Have you already forgotten the Chalin Fields?&#34; <BR> <BR>Breaking out in a dead run, he called playfully to Taerusu. &#34;Betcha you can&#39;t beat me to the river!&#34;   <BR> <BR>Taerusu charged straight ahead, right after Jorus.  &#34;Master, the day I can outrun you is the day the clouds fall from the sky!&#34; <BR> <BR>Leaping over fallen brush, Jorus yelled back.  &#34;Oh, come on!  I&#39;m not nearly that fast!  Just keep up!&#34; <BR> <BR>Taerusu began to catch up to Jorus, then saying, &#34;Master?  Are you losing your stride?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hardly!&#34; Jorus yelled back.  &#34;Watch me closely, now!&#34;   <BR> <BR>For the life of him, Taerusu could not understand how Jorus suddenly doubled his speed.  It was a five minute run for Taerusu; Jorus could have made it in two if he had wanted to, judging from his current speed. <BR> <BR>When they stopped at the river, Jorus was filling his waterskin.  &#34;Have a drink,&#34; he called to Taerusu.   <BR> <BR>Bending over and sipping from the stream, Taerusu said, &#34;I recall this place now.  The Kyn range is just a minute or two away.&#34;   <BR> <BR>The Kyn was a mountain range, fairly tall, and definately viewable from the ranch.  Its sister range, the Ryn range, was across the river and a bit further out.  The Kyn river valley led to the town of Roga, but it was insane to travel by the valley.  All it held was a chain of disasterous rapids, where avalanches had spilled into the shallow water.  Most Rogans crossed via the mountains.  The smart ones, anyways.   <BR> <BR>Running alongside the river, they came to a bridge.  The bridge was in good condition, rarely used; the last time it had been crossed--to the best of Jorus&#39;s knowledge--was about nine years ago.  Any of the monsters could have crossed the bridge.  Or...   <BR> <BR>Any person could have crossed it as well...   <BR> <BR>More then likely, someone -had- crossed it. <BR> <BR>&#34;Just across this, Taerusu.&#34; <BR> <BR>As they stepped across the bridge, Jorus began to hear voices.  Bad voices. <BR> <BR>Voices that didn&#39;t want to be heard.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Maybe we should take the both of &#39;em?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Nah, someone&#39;ll probably cook &#39;r goose if this one went gone missin&#39;.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;&#39;Kay, but we&#39;re missin&#39; out on a good opportunity if we let this &#39;un go.&#34; <BR> <BR>Then they were there.  The grave of the last monster to die on Jorus&#39;s ranch.  It had been a Henger, named Daht-Sieg 47.  On an expedition in the Torles mountains, it had suffered a fatal accident by way of an avalanche.  It was still alive when they had returned to the ranch, but died but a day after.  Jorus had buried it where he had found the disc stone that had made it.   <BR> <BR>And he knew what the men here were here for.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Gentlemen,&#34; he said, as he stalked into the clearing surrounding the altar.  He saw Henger 0446, out cold, next to it.  &#34;I suggest you retreat from your proceedings before something extremely bad happens to you all.  And I might enjoy it.&#34; <BR> <BR>Sneering, one holding a shovel spoke up.  &#34;And what makes you think you can stop us?&#34;   <BR> <BR>Taerusu stepped from the clearing and drew his sword.  &#34;I think I can stop you.&#34;   <BR> <BR>Stepping back a pace, the man with the shovel snapped back, &#34;Well, we brought our own, too.&#34;  A naga/monol breed stepped from the shadows and hissed.  &#34;It&#39;ll chop yer silly arm-er-ed brute right dun up.&#34;   <BR> <BR>The naga moved towards Taerusu, but Jorus closed his eyes, knowing what was to become of it.  The hiss of blade through air, then the sound of it making contact with the naga was still a grisly sound to Jorus.  When he opened his eyes, the naga was on the ground and Taerusu had the other miscreants against the thick woods.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Leave and take your naga or I will report you to the public.  And trust me, you don&#39;t want that.  The sharks can get awfully riled up when they smell blood in the water.&#34;   <BR> <BR>As they hefted the Naga and ran away, Jorus knelt before the shrine and continued, &#34;And if I ever hear of a Henger grave robbing, you will pay dearly.&#34;   <BR> <BR>They bolted, and Taerusu picked up 0446.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Take him back to the ranch.  I will stay here and pay my respects to Daht-Sieg.&#34;   <BR> <BR>After Taerusu had left, Jorus sighed. <BR> <BR>&#34;One should respect every little thing, be it living or dead.  I hope my new assistant understands that, or we have many scuffles to come.&#34;   <BR> <BR>He then stood up, and looked at the sky.   <BR> <BR>&#34;False moon rising; I too, will rise to meet you.&#34;

 I like how you use the use of punctuation and paragraphs helps to build suspense.
