 I knew that the judge&#39;s hammer is called a gavel, but for some reason I just couldn&#39;t think of the name. I must&#39;ve had a brain-fade or something. So I had to ask my brother what it was called because &#34;the judge said as he hammered down his hammer thingy.&#34; didn&#39;t sound quite right.
