 Not a yelp, a sigh, a gasp, nor breathe could escape Kale&#39;s lips as they walked into that room. The narrow hall they walked was lit by some strange, purple stone on the ceiling. Kale stayed close behind Clymain as they first entered the dungeon. Indeed, that&#39;s what it was, shackles held old skeletons to the wall, some just held the hands of their former captives. In this room, the purple light faded out, save the faint glow that showed them the way out. Kale stumbled a bit on a set of leg chains on the ground, then looked up at the only source of light in the room. <BR> <BR>A grate, but not a big one. This on seemed reinforced trice fold. The light from the moon angled in and cast a long, wide square of light half on the floor and half on the wall. The square had the black shadows of the bars throughout, but Kale was a little happier being able to see somewhat. <BR> <BR>Kale&#39;s eyes pierced into the darkness the best they could, and he stop to look at Clymain, who was performing a similar search, with similar luck. <BR> <BR>&#34;Clymain, lets get out of here.&#34; Kale whispered as he eyed the darkness. Kale knew there was a path behind him and a wall to his right, but he couldn&#39;t even see the other two walls. If there were walls there at all. <BR> <BR>&#34;Kale, I want to know what that thing is.&#34; Clymain stated as he tightened his grip on his Gorebaton. <BR> <BR>Kale heard it then. Something like a shuffle, or movement, almost dead ahead in the shadows. Clymain slowly snuck to his left, into the darkness. Apparently there wasn&#39;t a wall there after all. Kale tried to motion him back, but Clymain was going to try and flank it, he guessed. Kale grabbed his respected weapons a few minutes later, as he saw movement in the shadows directly ahead. <BR> <BR>Kale got himself in a comfortable fighting stance. Perhaps comfort would be more readily defined as prepared. He arched his scythe over his shoulder, ready to throw if need be. Then, the shadows seemed to meld around a form, a shadow that was sucking in all other shadows as it approached. <BR> <BR>&#34;Easy, killer. I don&#39;t want to die down here.&#34; Kale breathed out lightly at the sound of Clymain&#39;s voice. <BR> <BR>Clymain stepped out of the dark but just shy of the light, neutral in all respects as he said, &#34;I got nothing.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale face went long at the sight of another shadow, much larger than Clymain, &#34;Look out!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What!?&#34; Clymain exclaimed as he turned toward the dark. <BR> <BR>Kale was used to the sounds of battle, heard them time and time again. Yet now, only now, was he utterly disgusted with the sound of parting flesh and snapping bone. Clymain jerked hard, but stayed in the same place. He limply dropped his Gorebaton to his side, there it finally slipped from his hand. Kale watched in horror as Clymain rose, ever so slowly, to be even with the shadow&#39;s face. It held him there, stared at him, examined him. Kale heard several noises now, like metal hitting each other, and a grinding noise. With these sounds, came Clymain&#39;s voices, a garbled scream drowned by blood. Also ensuing, the sounds of snapping bone and twisting metal, and the horrible crunching and slicing that followed anyone to death. Kale could only stare in fear. <BR> <BR>Clymain&#39;s body slowly entered the shadows, and Kale finally got over his shock. He slung his scythe as hard as he could, aiming for the things leg. The blade whizzed into the dark, and Kale waited to here the meat rip. Instead, he heard metal on metal, and a flash of sparks shot up. In this light, Kale briefly saw what he was up against. <BR> <BR>The thing&#39;s legs were armor plated, running up to its hips, and its knee was bent, almost crouched. Kale could see no more of the hunched form because of Clymain&#39;s body still suspended in the air between Kale&#39;s view and the thing&#39;s upper body. Not seeing the beast&#39;s left hand, that must be the one that was holding Clymain. The flash also lasted a mere second at best. <BR> <BR>This did, however, make Clymain&#39;s body jump, spooking the shadow fiend. Clymain&#39;s body lowered slightly, and a solitary, piercing red eye seemed to lock onto Kale. Kale snatched his chain back quickly, catching his hand scythe with his trademark dexterity. <BR> <BR>Clymain&#39;s body sunk into the shadows quickly, and as soon as he went in, he came out. The body flew through the dank air and slammed into the far wall, right beside the purple illumination of the magic stone. Kale ran to his comrade, and cradled Clymain&#39;s head the best he could. <BR> <BR>He was dead. No last words of a soldier, no requested promises from a friend, no charge for a vendetta against his slayer, but above all, no good bye. Clymain&#39;s eyes stared blankly at the stone roof, but his face wasn&#39;t one of eternal pain. Instead, he was peaceful, slightly surprised, but suffered none. Kale looked at his chest, which looked as if it was stabbed by a thousand swords. The metal of the chest plate had been twisted and shredded by something powerful, and the chest didn&#39;t stand a chance against this monstrosities grip. It was cut in no particular fashion, just mutilated. How could something do this so fast? <BR> <BR>Kale asked himself this as he returned his sights to the one bright red dot in the dark. He stood, walked to where he was on the other side of the moon light before issuing his challenge. <BR> <BR>&#34;Emerge fiend of the shadows. Assassin of the night, reveal yourself to be destroyed.&#34; Kale said defiantly. <BR> <BR>He was not prepared. The lumbering form slammed its right foot into the stone floor first. Kale saw an assortment of melted armor and weapons were grafted onto it. Several daggers lined just over the toes, and one large axe blade was attached to its heel. The knee was bent, and had a large kite shield for more less a knee pad. The rest of its flesh wasn&#39;t bare, with scraps of metal fused to the skin like a prefab armor.  The skin that was exposed was a milky, yellowish white tone. Kale could easily see the veins running throughout the muscle, they were blackened slightly, almost dead. The skin looked soggy, almost soaking wet but not dripping any water on the ground. <BR> <BR>The as the second knee and leg appeared, they were in the same manner. The thing tried to lean back, keeping its head and torso in the shadows, almost fearful of Kale. Then the right hand emerged and Kale knew he had been right all along. <BR> <BR>The Caustrodon claw emerged slowly. It too, had been altered. The arm had several pieces of plate strapped to it, but the claws remained the same. As the other emerged from the shadow, there was no question in Kale&#39;s mind. The arm was, like everything else, fortified with metal plates on its upper arm. Its forearm was, however, completely reconstructed. <BR> <BR>From the elbow out, were four rods, converging at a tip to be defined as &#39;the hand&#39;. These beams were bolted directly into the flesh just past the elbow, and did not interfere with the arms ability to bend. The rods were also slightly reinforced with plating to protect the gears that could be seen inside that ran the entirety of the forearm. The hand was something menacing. Four blades held the predominance of the sight. Scimitars, and they were set in a X like fashion. They were all pointed inward like some giant, iron claw. Inside of these, were several dozen daggers. The longer ones formed a ring, and inside this ring were the smaller daggers, also in a ring. Several gears turned and cranked, and a grinding sounds came forth. The fingers, one could say, opened and closed, and the blade circles inside began to spin, opposite of each other. It would also be of note the blood that covered most of this weapon now, making it look twice as grueling. <BR> <BR>Kale could not believe this defilement, this desecration. Then, the rest of the beast emerged. The very first thing Kale noticed was the arms attached to its stomach. They were long, just short of a shoulder to be considered more arms. Three resided on its stomach. Two more on its chest, and then Kale noticed one attached to the thing&#39;s right arm biceps. The chest still held its emptiness, per say, as Kale could see the hole there still resided. The ribs and the such protruded into this hole, not functional organs, not needed really. Not for a zombie. The rest of the chest and stomach and even the additional arms were just as the rest of the beast, plated with armor and weapons. <BR> <BR>&#34;What the hell did they do to you?&#34; Kale spoke ever so slowly. <BR> <BR>The creature&#39;s red eye finally bobbed into vision. Its snarl was still there, the same one it had in death. Now, however, the right side of his head had a makeshift helmet melded onto it. It only encompassed half its head, made out of assorted shields and armor. The one eye shined bright red, and Kale wasn&#39;t sure it could even see out of it. The ear on that side of the head was removed completely, and the half helm ran only down to its upper lip. The throat was still in bloody ribbons, from were Kale tore it out before. The eye had a circular set of slimmer, overlapping plates around it. Kale watched as they contracted and expanded, focusing on him. Kale supposed this was to assist its vision, much like squinting in the sun light. <BR> <BR>The snarl never changed, not once. Kale figured it didn&#39;t need to eat, and rigor mortis had already set in anyway. But how? How did they bring it back? How did they make this thing? Kale pondered all this as the beast stood there, unsure of its ability to kill Kale. After all, Kale was the reason it died first. <BR> <BR>Kale regained his mind set, staring at the beast, he sputtered, &#34;I&#39;ll free you.&#34; <BR> <BR>The creature roared, loudly, and swung at Kale with its right arm, the flesh arm. Kale bobbed out of the way rather surprised that the creature was actually faster. Kale slung his scythe with his right hand, aiming for the side of the beast&#39;s neck, letting the slack of the chain run. The beast turned into its own swing, and Kale was shocked when it turned his back to him. <BR> <BR>The thing&#39;s back was literally covered in hands. Some in gauntlets, some just bare hands. The entire back was covered, side to side, with grasping hands, all moving, all seemingly alive. Not arms, like the ones on front, just hands, connected at the wrist. The back was also plated with assorted armor in places, but not really concerned with full protection. <BR> <BR>This garden of appendages grabbed Kale&#39;s scythe quickly. Two actually grabbed the scythe, three more grasped the chain. Kale tugged back quickly, slicing one of the hands off, but another grabbed the scythe. In the turmoil, the beast turned quickly. Its hand let go about the time the thing spun, but Kale barely saw the axe blade on the back of the foot coming in time. <BR> <BR>Kale leaned back, the foot passing mere inches from his chest. As the round house spun, Kale threw his axe around the passing foot, grabbed his axe in the air, and rolled. He managed to grab the chain again, and yanked the scythe to him. He grabbed the scythe quickly as the beast began to recover, and Kale rolled again. Kale now had his chain wrapped around one of the monster&#39;s legs. This time, as the creature gained its footing, Kale tried to dive between its legs. <BR> <BR>Tried to. As Kale dove, his saw one of the new bottom arms reach down, balled into a fist. It rose quickly, and slammed into Kale&#39;s shoulder. Kale found himself doing a flip, right in front of the Caustrodon, who wasted no time. <BR> <BR>In mid spin, Kale saw only the blare of the fist as the thing&#39;s right hand slammed into Kale. Kale was flying through the air in the next instant. It seemed like an eternity of waiting to hit the wall, but the moment finally came. He was upside down, and bounced off the wall with tremendous force, knocking several chunks of stone out. Kale hit with enough force that after he bounced off, he didn&#39;t land on his head, rather his stomach. <BR> <BR>Kale shook his head slightly, then looked over his shoulder. The beast was there, foot up and coming down quickly. Kale rolled to his right and the foot planted itself firmly into the floor. Kale scampered to his feet, only to have the extra arm on the creature&#39;s right shoulder grab him by the throat. <BR> <BR>Kale struggled with the grip, letting his scythe fall out of his right hand, grabbing at the fingers that now choked him. The beast rose slowly, passively, staring to its right at the blackish insect he remembered. The red eye made several noises as the plates pulled in to were you could barely see the red. Like a metallic squint, Kale had to hurry. <BR> <BR>In his mindset, plans didn&#39;t count. He was dying, and his instincts took over. He held the axe tight and from under, slashed up at the creature&#39;s wrist. <BR> <BR>He hit true, and sliced deep, but the Caustrodon stared on. Could it feel pain? Kale hacked again and again, and the splintered wrist finally shattered. Kale landed, tearing the hand from his throat. Kale looked up to see the thing turn to him. It looked to its right at the handless arm, then back down to Kale. <BR> <BR>Kale heart sank as the gears turned, the metal clanked and the blades spun. He leaned back on his axe and his now empty right hand. His hand landed on something, peculiar. Wood? In here? Kale glanced down to see his hand mere inches from being impaled on a... <BR> <BR>&#34;That&#39;s it...&#34; Kale said to himself slowly as he got a slightly better grip on the wooden object. <BR> <BR>The metallic, spinning claw of death opened wide, the scimitars almost begging for another purchase, wincing in anticipation. The hand rose above the snarled face that never changed expression, and the beast was ready to exact its revenge. <BR> <BR>As the hand reached its peak, Kale moved. He slung his right hand up as fast and hard as he could, slinging the Gorebaton directly into the spinning blades. He then ran for the door, his axe in his left hand and the scythe dragging shortly behind him on the chain. He yanked the chain quickly, snatching his scythe out of the air, he wrapped his right arm around his chest, cradling his broken ribs. <BR> <BR>Of course, all this transpired in a matter of seconds, as did what followed. The Gorebaton slammed into the pit of daggers with inexpressible speed. The daggers and blades from both weapons shattered and broke, sending blades of all shapes and sizing into the far reaches of the room. Several daggers planted themselves into the Caustrodon&#39;s hide, some merely bounced off the armor. The claw shattered and fell apart, several gears cranked there last and spiraled into the darkness. Kale saw one of the arms on its stomach lopped off by a falling scimitar as he looked over his shoulder. Two hands fell to the ground behind it, also chopped off. <BR> <BR>Kale wasn&#39;t as lucky as he thought, as several daggers flew down the hall as well. As Kale exited the door, he turned left, but didn&#39;t quiet make the stairs. One dagger planted itself between the plates on his left thigh as he turned. Still another slammed into his left arm, between the armor as well. The rest either bounced off his armor or missed him, some closer than others. He collapsed on the stairwell. Crawling up to his feet as he heard the Caustrodon&#39;s mad roar of aggression. He began climbing the steps as fast as he could. He heard the door shatter into pieces under him, the creature in pursuit. <BR> <BR>When Kale reached the top, he had a gut wrenching realization. How was he getting out? Kale pressed his back against the grate and tried to lift it by himself. Pain rampaged through his body, his mind, his heart. <BR> <BR>The roar again, climbing the stairs now, it had to be. <BR> <BR>Kale pushed again, lifting it slightly, but not enough to get out. He ripped the dagger from his thigh and the other from his arm, throwing them into the pit. <BR> <BR>Two splashes, the Caustrodon stopped when it heard them. <BR> <BR>Kale kept pushing lifting, nothing gave this time as his strength faded. <BR> <BR>Big splash. Kale looked into the darkness of the pit. Ripping flesh, thuds of bodies that flew from that watery grave. It roared again in frustration. <BR> <BR>Kale lifted the grate very slightly. A guard, a shadow on the wall. <BR> <BR>&#34;Help!&#34; Kale screamed to no avail. The guard mumbled something from he wall and stumbled away. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey, help! Please help!&#34; Kale screamed as he pushed against the grate. <BR> <BR>The roar, angry roar. Fast steps, back on stairs. Must hurry. <BR> <BR>Kale pushed as hard as a desperate man would now, the adrenaline pumping ten fold. The grate raised, and Kale wedged his chest plate between it and the ground. Kale pulled his legs free from the grate just in time to hear the final roar that was right behind him. <BR> <BR>Kale stood and fumbled towards a ladder by the gate. He heard the roar again and turned quickly to see the grate flying off the pit. The Caustrodon bounded out of the pit in a rage. Shrapnel of all shorts riddled its body. Bloody hands lay limp, severed but not quiet off. The red eye jerked this way and that, it turned again and again. Searching, searching for Kale. For revenge. <BR> <BR>Kale ran, if one would call it that, to the ladder. He grasped it with his left hand, letting his axe dangle at his side. He climbed with his feet mainly, and continued to cradle his ribs. <BR> <BR>The roar, again. He was spotted. The insect scurrying up the wall. Coming to smash, to kill, must hurry. <BR> <BR>Kale reached the top and rolled onto it. As he stood, he saw one of the guards fumbling away from him. <BR> <BR>&#34;Help!&#34; He yelped as he ran toward the guard. <BR> <BR>He was an amazingly thin one, this guard, with long, thin gray hair and seemingly no meat to him. <BR> <BR>Kale grabbed his shoulder and spun him. Kale gasped in the reeking air around the skull he was faced with and fell flat on his back, kicking himself away. <BR> <BR>The empty sockets gazed toward him as if eyes were actually there. The front few teeth were knocked completely out of this skeleton, and the helmet wobbled loosely on its head. Perhaps it fit once, when it had hair, a scalp, flesh. <BR> <BR>Kale gasped again as he turned, only to see one, long, putrid arm slap the ground in front of him, the Caustrodon not far behind. <BR> <BR>Kale, acting quickly, placed his scythe firmly into the castle wall, and jumped. Not diving off the edge, but riding the wall down more less, repelling with his chain. The scythe gave way about halfway down. <BR> <BR>Kale landed hard on the edge of the putrid moat. He grabbed at the dirt for a purchase to keep from sliding in, but found none. He saw a hole in the wall where a brick had obviously fallen out. Acting fast again but not thinking at all, he threw his axe by its chain into this hole. It went through, and Kale pulled him out of the hole. <BR> <BR>Kale looked into the pit now. Oil perhaps. This mire was something he&#39;d rather not land in, but how to get across? <BR> <BR>The roar. <BR> <BR>Kale looked up only to see the Caustrodon halfway down. He jumped back as the creature landed in the moat. Kale slammed his back to the wall as the crude substance seemed to erupt from the pit. Kale glanced in briefly, to see the Caustrodon completely gone. <BR> <BR>Kale sighed, it had to take this to destroy that thing. Then, the liquid erupted again as the enraged Caustrodon fought its sticky confines, all its hands and arms fighting the substance. <BR> <BR>Kale had long since given up thinking, given up caution, given up guessing odds. With only action, he grabbed his weapons in each hand, despite the pain. He jumped into the pit. Planting both feet firmly into the beat&#39;s flesh and metallic skull, he jumped again, to the other side of the moat. He planted both weapons into the side of the drop off, and gritted his teeth as his ribs shifted. He looked over his shoulder. <BR> <BR>Submerged again, thanks to Kale. Better hurry. <BR> <BR>Kale placed axe in front of scythe, then scythe before axe, and climbed his way out of the hole. He lay there now, looking up the giant wall. The undead sentries were gathering now. Better hurry. <BR> <BR>Kale stood in time to see the Caustrodon rise again. It grabbed into the same gouges Kale had just made climbing out, and began to ascend. <BR> <BR>What now? Can&#39;t outrun it, can&#39;t fight it, what now? <BR> <BR>Kale&#39;s instincts took hold once more. <BR> <BR>The Caustrodon rose slowly from the edge of the moat. The substance stuck to its entirety, every inch was black. As it slowly tried to regain its footing, it looked up for its prey. Kale was already en route. <BR> <BR>Kale sprinted from some 15 feet away, and the Caustrodon looked up only at the last second. With a battle cry that would have made Clymain proud, Kale swung his scythe upward in his right hand with a vengeance. The scythe sliced into the beast&#39;s good eye, and it jerked back out of reflex. Kale capitalized yet again, throwing all the speed he had built up into his shoulder, slamming into the Caustrodon&#39;s stomach. The arms had no time to react. <BR> <BR>The beast fell again, this time, it fell back. It bounced off the slope with a load roar as it plunged head first into the moat. <BR> <BR>Kale looked down in time to see the metallic feet sink into the pit. The thing might not drown, but there is no way it could maneuver in that tight a spot to turn around and swim. The metal would drag it to the bottom, there in darkness, it would wait, and rot. Hopefully, die again. <BR> <BR>Kale returned his gaze to the castle wall. Several of the undead soldiers began to fall back. Maybe to sound an alarm, or to come after him themselves. Kale decided not to find out, and began walking. <BR> <BR>Later that evening... <BR> <BR>Kale had walked for hours, his back ached, his leg throbbed, his arm hurt, and his ribs were killing him, literally. One felt deeper than the others, and Kale was afraid it might puncture a lung. He had made it to the dead trees some 15 minutes ago, and had no sign of the trail they had taken here, nor any sign that the Doom March was after him. He leaned against a tree now, to rest, to die, to be capture, to be eaten. It didn&#39;t matter anymore. <BR> <BR>He heard the breaking of dead twigs behind him, and stopped breathing... <BR> <BR>He heard voices. Close. <BR> <BR>He held his scythe to his chest, his axe at his side. If he went down, he&#39;d go down fighting... <BR> <BR>Voices. Closer. <BR> <BR>Kale had a vision of Clymain the day before. A proud warrior, saved Kale&#39;s life many times. He was gone, died at the hands of something so terrible... <BR> <BR>Very close, the voices. <BR> <BR>Kale thought of the Caustrodon&#39;s eyes as he had straddled its chest, the look of horror on its face as Kale tore out its throat. Kale would see that look again, from Baron Perenolde... <BR> <BR>Too close. <BR> <BR>Kale jumped from behind the tree. The figures were blurry, masked in a case of fog that might have been there or just in Kale&#39;s mind. He slung his scythe at the closest blur. It jumped, but Kale would&#39;ve missed anyway. He grabbed his axe and slung wildly at the shapes. Their forms leaped and bounded away, unsure of this surprise attack. <BR> <BR>&#34;<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> zombies and their demonic speed.&#34; Kale sputtered. <BR> <BR>He jerked on his chain to pull his scythe back. His exhaustion was taking its tool, as he missed catching it, and it bounced off his chest plate with a &#42;twang&#42;. He looked down at it, surprised he missed. He saw three scythes, each attached to a different chain. He paused at this, and decided to go for the one on the right. His hand found only soft dirt under the mirage, and his eyes saw only black as he lowered all the way to the ground in an unconscious stupor. He muttered still as he fell, tears brimming as he passed into darkness. <BR> <BR>&#34;Clymain...&#34; <BR> <BR>Stay Tuned. CHB <BR>-Feedback always welcome-
