 Alright here is chapter 3.  Hope you like it! <BR> <BR>Chapter 3: The Saint <BR> <BR>	Hunter pressed his sword down a little, drawing a small red bread of blood.  Wes tried to push himself flatter onto the ground, but it was useless.  It felt as if an invisible pressure were building upon Wes.  Sweat began to push out from his forehead.  Hunter smiled as he saw Wes’ useless struggle to escape from his sword. <BR>	 <BR>“This was easy,” Hunter chuckled, “I feel bad that I actually have to kill you.”  <BR> Just as Hunter finished a tall shadow washed over the two, no sound was heard.  The two ignored it thinking it’s just a passing cloud.  But then the shadow’s owner spoke in a strong confident voice. <BR> <BR>“We are all God’s children, it is not right to kill a brother, no matter what has happened.  Please release your weapon your you shall be forced to do so.” <BR> <BR>Hunter felt offended and looked over to see a tall man, towering over the two.  A brown triangular pullover fell over his shoulders, it flapped in the breeze.  A brown hat was heavily placed onto his head, it looked old as the brims dropped down and where worn.  The figure was intimidating, even to Hunter, but he showed no fear, his face still shown with heavy determination.  Hunter stood there, still, sword still to Wes’ neck. <BR> <BR>“Last time I’m telling you, put the sword down,” said the figure.  It didn’t even seem that he was talking, or it was hard to tell and the neck of the pull over was tall and covered it’s mouth.  The hat was pulled down to the eyes, casting a solid shadow that hid all the features.   <BR> <BR>Hunter still stood his ground, all that moved was the wide grin that spread across his face.  The figure simply lifted a gloved hand up and snapped his fingers.  Next thing Hunter knew a strong blow hit him on the back of his head and he was biting the ground.  The sword clattered to t ground.  Wes slowly got up, scratching his head.  He looked up at the stranger, <BR> <BR>“Um…thanks,” Wes said. <BR>“Don’t thank me thank Skippy there,” the man said pointing past Wes. <BR> <BR>Wes looked over to see a small blue Hopper with a small white horn jutting out of his forehead.   <BR> <BR>	“Uh…thanks,” said Wes.  Unsure weather what the man’s motives was.  Wes turned toward the stranger and looked up into the dark blackness that covered the man’s face.  Within the unseen depths, the stranger smiled. <BR> <BR>	“Well…” the stranger began, “aren’t you gonna ask why I saved you?”  Wes felt confused. <BR> <BR>	“Uh…why did you?” Wes asked.  The man plucked his hat off and folded his tall color, revealing short but thick black hair, slightly tanned skin and a kind and gentle face. <BR> <BR>	“To tell you the truth, you seemed to need it,” the man said.  Wes thought that wasn’t a very good reason, especially because the man didn’t know if Wes was actually the bad guy there or not. <BR> <BR>	“Well once again thank you,” Wes turned toward Skippy, “both of you.”   <BR>	“Oh I’m sorry for being improper, I never even introduced myself.  I am Rancher.  Preacher of the highly shrine of the Dragon,” Rancher replied.  <BR>	“I’m Skippy, nice to meet you,” chirped the Hopper.  Wes got a concerned look on his face and asked Rancher, <BR> <BR>	“Did you happen to pass by a black dino carrying an unconscious tiger?” <BR>	“No,” said Rancher, “Did you, Killa Kan or King see anything Skippy?” <BR>	“Not that I remember.”  <BR>	“Why?” asked Rancher. <BR>	“Because, that’s my tiger, Fury.” <BR> <BR>	Skipper walked toward a small covered wagon near the edge of the tree line.  The wagon was painted red and said “DRAGON” in bold black letters on the side.  A large gold, metal looking golem was strapped into a harness at the front.  Skipper hopped into the wagon from the back. <BR> <BR>	“What’s that?” asked Wes pointing toward the strange looking golem. <BR>	“That’s Killa Kan, my Gobi,” said Rancher.  Rancher looked down at the knocked out body of Hunter.  He picked up the limp body and slung it over his shoulder.   <BR> <BR>	“I’ll be right back,” Rancher said, walking into the town.  Wes guessed he’d be taking Hunter to the constabularies office.  Wes decided to check out the cover wagon.  He walked over, the titan like Gobi loomed over Wes looking down on him.  Wes was afraid but he knew most golems were friendly creatures. <BR> <BR>	“Hello,” the golem spoke, in a hollow, echo like voice.  Wes simply waved to him, then he heard Rancher coming up behind him.  Rancher put his hands on Wes’ shoulders. <BR> <BR>	“Well,” Rancher began, “we better find Fury” At this Wes turned to face the tall preacher.   <BR>	“You’re going to help me?” asked Wes, still unsure if the man was really of good motives.  Rancher nodded confidently. <BR>	Rancher helped Wes up into the back of the covered wagon.  It was open in the back, but he couldn’t have seen that before because of the wagon’s direction to his perspective.  Inside he saw a few crates, which he guessed contained food, and he saw the small Hopper sitting on one and a man-sized gold and white Hair with it’s back against a side.  Wes guessed the Hair to be King, the one Rancher mentioned before.   <BR> <BR>	Rancher worker his way through the back and into the opening, leading toward the seat at the front.   <BR> <BR>	“What direction did the dino head?” Rancher asked. <BR>	“North.  We should probably try checking Dark Wood city since it’s that direction any ways,” Wes replied, “it’s only about 5 miles up,” he added. <BR>	“Right, okay Killa Kan let’s head north!” Rancher said excitedly. <BR> <BR>	Standing atop a building, about 20 yards from the tree line a tall man’s outline was highlighted by the now rising sun.  All that was decipherable about him was a long flowing cloth and some form of short hair. <BR> <BR>	“It’s only about time,” the man simply spoke, in a soft voice, sounding like a light breeze.  He placed a worn hat atop his head.  He stood there, on the building.  The raising sun blackened his visage, the breeze blew his cloth.  A smile crept across his face.       <BR> <BR>	“Only about time,” he repeated.  <BR> <BR>-Nicholas D. Wolfwood-
