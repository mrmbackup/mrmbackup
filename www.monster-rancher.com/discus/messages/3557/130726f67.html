 The Voicless Tiger pt.1 <BR>By Necronomicon <BR> <BR>&#34;Roar, roar you pup do it.&#34; <BR> <BR>Ice heard his fathers voice echo over and over in his head. He opened his mouth and tried to make a noise, nothing came from his throat. <BR> <BR>&#34;What good is a Tiger that cannot roar&#34; Ices father growled. &#34;A mute, a mute for a son. As if enough bad things haven&#39;t happened already to me in my life. But this, this tops them. I thought that with time you would gain a voice a mere sound at least but I guess that was expecting to much.&#34; <BR> <BR>Ice opened his mouth he wanted to tell his father he was sorry that he didn&#39;t mean to be the way he was. But as always he made no sound when he opened his mouth. He hated himself for the way he was, he hated himself for dissapointing his father. <BR> <BR>&#34;Nothing you are no good, why did your mother give up her life for you it was a waste. She was so strong so courageous, then she died giving birth to YOU.&#34; <BR> <BR>Ice had heard it before the same story over and over again and he always felt bad for the death of his mother. He knew he could never change his mothers death never take it back but he promised himself he would make his father proud of him one day. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hmf get to sleep you mut, NOW LEAVE ME GET OUT OF MY SIGHT&#34; his father yelled at the top of his voice. <BR> <BR>Ice slumped to his tree tail between his legs and head down. He decided tommorow he would leave and enter a tournament. He would show his father he wasn&#39;t useless. He would show him that he could fight, that he could be a champion. Maybe then his father would be proud of him.

 The Voiceless Tiger pt.2 <BR>By Necronomicon Aka Chad Cup <BR> <BR>&#34;Ladies and gentlemen&#34; the announcer roared over the microphone captivating the audience. &#34;Let me introduce a new rival to the Beginers Cup. A Tiger who can not make any noise what so ever. A mute tiger ladies and gentlemen&#34;. A murmur went through the crowd, a mute tiger participating in a battle was completely ubelievable even the idea of a mute tiger was outrageous. &#34;Yes ladies and gentlemen you heard right a MUTE tiger, we actually had to play charades to figure out his name. Ladies and gentlemen let me introduce to you ICE&#34; <BR> <BR>There was an eruption of applause and cheers but also a mingle of boos and hisses. Ice guessed not all watchers were tiger fans. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now ladies and gentlemen it is my privelege to introduce a returning fighter&#34;. The lights dimmed and the announcer took a long pause to draw out the suspense, &#34;ROXARAN!!!&#34; the anouncer shouted. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hmf he cant be that strong, can he?&#34; Ice thought to himself. <BR> <BR>Boom, boom, boom, boom, the boom as of monstrous feet approached closer and closer, the ground shook from the monstrous crashes. The two glowing spots high off the ground appeared in the dark depths of the hall opposite to him. Slowly the yellow spots seemed to be measuring him trying to find his strengths. The head of the beast emmerged from the dark.  <BR> <BR>&#34;No, no, no, no, no, no&#34; Ice thought &#34;not a Dragon anything but that, by a Mochis blubber how in the world can he be in the Beginers Cup&#34; <BR> <BR>The monstrous creature was all muscle it raised its head and breathed a jet of pure red flame from its monstous mouth. Fangs larger than his horns glinting in the light. Its bright gleaming armor shining in the arena. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh no an Armor Dragon at that, what are they thinking I could be killed.&#34; <BR> <BR>The announcer chuckled over the mike &#34;it looks like this little tiger is ready to bolt.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;If you try to run&#34; the dragon roared &#34;I swear I will hunt you down. I will find your family and rip them apart.&#34; <BR> <BR>Ice recognized the dragons way of acting from his fathers lessons. <BR> <BR>&#34;Do not pay attention to an enemies bosts, they are just trying to frighten you, make the battle easier for themselves.&#34; <BR> <BR>Ices lesson all came flooding to him he suddenly became filled with confidence and knew this dragon would be no match for him. <BR> <BR>&#34;Let the battle begin&#34; the announcer roared. <BR> <BR>The dragon started to attack but its movements were slow and lethargic. Ice dodged every sweep of a wing or slash of a claw the dragon threw at him. <BR>He was suddenly thrown back though by a violent wind. The dragon steped towards Ices unmoving form and lifted a fist when Ice moved he jumped for one of the dragons exposed wings and made a hole straight through it. He jumped towards the other and ripped it with his fangs. The dragon did nothing to attack back he nearly stood there quivering. Ice backed away from his prey to find a whole in its armor. He found it just below the right pauldron was a small hole. Ice knew he could finish this he prepared to charge, when suddenly the dragon roared a fieresome powerful roar, a roar that spoke of vengeance to come.  <BR> <BR>The dragon charged towards Ice attack faster and stonger then ever before. Ice was dodging them all tell suddenly the dragons tail whipped under his feet slamming him to the ground. The dragon reached down pinning Ice to the ground with a massive hand. Ice tried to bite the hand but merely contacted cold steal. It reared its head up preparing to breath its fire. Ice closed his eyes and thought of his father, even though the old dog had sometimes been cruel to him Ice still knew he loved him and his father would be heartbroken if he ever became seriously hurt. He had taught and raised Ice all on his own he licked Ice&#39;s wounds. Always looked after him and he would not let his fathers works all go to ashes because of some muscle headed dragon. <BR> <BR>Ice&#39;s eyes flew open he stared at the dragon and let all his anger loose he bit through the gauntleted fist and jump away when the dragon roared in pain and raised its hand from him. Ice prepared to charge when a pure blue blast of lightning flew from his horns and struck the dragon in the chest. <BR> <BR>&#34;D.d.did I do that&#34; ice stammered in his thoughts. <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll have to talk to pop about that.&#34; <BR> <BR>Ice stared at the dragon as it toppled to the ground and fainted. <BR> <BR>There was total silence in the crowd. Ice wondered if he had done something wrong when suddenly the whole stadium burst int cheers. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ladies and gentlemen we have a very unlikely winner&#34; <BR> <BR>Ice held his head high, he knew news of his victory would spread through the streets. He would gain fame very quickly. He felt happy and confident. Soon he would be home with a fat purse and a medal hanging from his horn. His father would be proud finally something to make his father proud. <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if ive put my story in the correct place if it is not please tell me.

 Yeah, just say that Chapters 1 and 2 are located here.  Maybe you could get a mod to move them, but they are very busy right now with EVO, so it may be a while.
