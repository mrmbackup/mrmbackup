<B>INTRO</B> <BR> <BR>Ok, for you people who have played Bloody Roar and Bloody Roar 2 will get how this story is organized. For those who have not played Bloody Roar or any sequel, will still get it. It is organized just like when you play story mode on Bloody Roar. Except this Story Mode is based on Monster Rancher 2. I just thought I would do something like this just for fun. <BR> <BR><B>Monster Roar</B> <BR> <BR>One day when Mocchi was walking down the street, he sees 2 monsters fighting. It was a Zuum and a Gali. As the Mocchi walked closer he sees that the Zuum is trying to mug the Gali. Gali is trying to out wit him with his Inteligence but Zuum is not that stupid and attacks the Gali. Mocchi runs towards them and gives the Zuum a 1-2 thrust. The Zuum turns and tries to give Mocchi a bite, but the Mocchis speed is to high and he misses. The Zuum is now vulnerable to a attack, and the Mocchi knew it was a perfect time. He gave the Zuum a Mocchi beam and the Zuum fell to the ground. The Gali now very scared runs off without saying thanks or anything and the Mocchi thought, how rude. Then the Zuum asks why he did not mind his own bussiness. The Mocchi says because he does not like to see violence, nor use it. The Mocchi says to the Zuum if he is part of the FIMBA. The Zuum says yes, and the Mocchi asks for the leader, the great Joker. The Zuum says I wont speak, you can&#39;t make me. The Mocchi is very tired of this guessing game and disposes of him with giant press. Now on his journey again, he walks through a neiborhood that he has never been to. He notices that everyone is staring at him. Then he notices that the ground is starting to shack every couple seconds. Then something started to come in focus. It was a giant Golem running right towards him. Mocchi moves while the Golem tried to hit him. The Mocchi then knew that he was a follower of the Great Joker. Mocchi turns around and hits him with a Mocchi ray in the leg. The Golem did not really feel to much and tried to hit Mocchi with his fist. The Golem misses do to low Skill and hits another monster. Especially the wrong monster, a Pheonix. The Phoenix is furious and does a Fire Tornado, and the Golem gets toasted. The Mocchi was relieved and on his mission to find the Great Joker again. On his way he started thinking if he really had a real twin brother or if the Great Joker just created a clone of him. No matter what it was, the Great Joker must die because of the death of his mother. But if Mocchi really had a Evil Twin Brother, with the same Genes, than it would be really difficult to beat him, and on top of that the Great Joker. But Mocchi will do all he can to stop the Evil. <BR> <BR>&#40;To be continued&#41;

 While Mocchi was thinking, he did not notice the territory that he was walking into. It started getting darker, and darker, until he could not see his own hands. It was pitch black. Then he heard a cat noise. It was Mew, he was sure of it. It&#39;s eyes glowed, and told the Mocchi that he is the bringer of death, stealth assasin Mew. You have walked on my land, and you shall pay, it said. It went at Mocchi with a twindling, but quick as Mocchi was, the Mew missed, and Mocchi nailed him with a giant press. Does not seem to be the bringer of death. Seems like he brings death on himself. While Mew was on the floor he said to the Mocchi, &#34;I know what you search&#34;. The Mocchi was puzzled. You search him, the mew said. He is up north in a cave, in the mountains. You will find him there. The Mocchi did not know wether to trust him, or not. He had nothing else to do but trust him, and said, if you lie, you will pay even worse than this time, you will pay with your life. So on his way north, he walked. He traveled for miles and miles toward the mountains that the Mew had said. He walked through Desert, Snow, Rain and finally he was near. When the Mountains came into view, he saw a tall figure, start aproaching him. It was a Zilla, and it did not seem happy. It looked some sort of body guard or security. He said that noone may enter here, only the FIMBA. Then the Zilla noticed that this Mocchi was the one. The enemy who must die. He called for backup and almost instantly 4 or 5 more Zillas came up and circled the Mocchi. He was in a major mess now... <BR> <BR>&#40;to be continued&#41;
