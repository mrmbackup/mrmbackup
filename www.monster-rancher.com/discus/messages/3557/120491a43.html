 &#34;Wow! This is amazing!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No kidding - they really pulled out all the stops for this one.&#34; <BR> <BR>Cormac and Lisa were riding on the roof of the coach as it trundled up the main road of Kanturk. The guards which had been assigned to escort them to the arena had protested at first, but it was evident that they hadn&#39;t been chosen for their mental abilities, and Lisa&#39;s silver tongue soon enabled the to escape the confinement of the stuffy cabin and enjoy the brilliant sunshine. The view up there was better, too. <BR> <BR>The festivities surrounding the tournament were in full swing. Brightly coloured banners criss-crossed the sand-coloured buildings, fluttering in the breeze above them, and golden streamers tumbled lazily through the air, glittering in the sunlight like shining butterflies. <BR> <BR>Stalls lined every path and road, offering delicious foodstuffs from every corner of the world - from juicy fruits of Parepare to the famously hot spices of Kawera, and succulent seafood hailing from the briny depths of Torble. The smells wafting from the array of culinary delights mingled and mixed, creating a unique aroma that made one&#39;s mouth water within moments. <BR> <BR>Other stalls offered toys, games, souvenirs and more exotic goods. Carnival acts were dotted around the street, including fire-breathers, sword-swallowers, jugglers, clowns, and performing monsters. The pair laughed at dancing Garus and were amazed by dancing Ogyos, amongst others. The mood of celebration was compounded by lively music emanating from every street corner. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey, look!&#34;, cried Lisa, pointing at a particular stall. &#34;Tournament programs! Can we get one? I&#39;d love to see my name in there!&#34;. <BR> <BR>Cormac chuckled. &#34;Well, let&#39;s see.&#34;. He called down to the driver below them: &#34;Hey, can we stop for a sec? I wanna get something.&#34; <BR> <BR>After a brief, mumbled conversation with the guards, the driver tugged on the reigns, bringing the Baku pulling them to a halt. Cormac leapt nimbly off the coach and strolled over to the stall. <BR> <BR>&#34;Excuse me, could I have two programs please?&#34; he asked the old woman behind the small cheerily. <BR> <BR>&#34;Of course, dear.&#34; she replied, smiling a small toothless grin. She handed him the sleek papers. &#34;So, are you heading to the games then?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; said Cormac, a slight smile playing on his features. He was still a relative unknown, and preferred traveling incognito anyway. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ah, that&#39;s lovely. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be a grand day. I do wish that I could go, but someone has to sell the programs, right?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I’m sorry to hear that.&#34; <BR> <BR>She gave a small sigh. &#34;Oh, it&#39;s alright. Pay no heed an old woman&#39;s ramblings. You just go enjoy yourself, love.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Thanks a lot.&#34; <BR> <BR>Cormac reached down to close his money pouch. As his fingers closed on empty air, the unkempt youth next to him suddenly broke away and fled through the crowds. Cormac, without any conscious thought, instantly followed. He was vaguely aware of Lisa shouting behind him, but he kept his eyes firmly locked on the back of the fleeing thief. He pushed past startled festival-goers, leapt over spilt produce and knocked over at least one stall. A trail of confusion and chaos followed the pair. <BR> <BR>At last the thief ducked into a dark, damp alley. Rashly, Cormac followed. The narrow and dirty alley curved around the buildings, leading to a maze of tiny streets and lanes. Despite the crowds nearby, the area was deserted. Reaching a crossroads, Cormac found that the thief had vanished. He stopped, breathing heavily, allowing his mind to catch up with the rest of his body. The tall buildings blocked out the sunlight, shrouding the area in deep shadows. The hairs rose on the back of Cormac&#39;s neck. Instinctively, he turned to his left and raised his hand to shield himself... <BR> <BR>There was a gasp of pain, and something metallic dropped out of the blackness in front of him and clanged on the ground. He took a step backwards as the thief slumped forwards onto one knee, clutching at his shoulder. A Kato stood on his back, its claws sunk through the youth’s shoulder. Cormac felt faint just looking at the cruel claws protruding from the stricken thief’s shoulder. Blood dripped along the claws and onto the cobblestones. <BR> <BR>“Alright, Harlequin. Stop him from running.” came a low voice from the shadows. <BR> <BR>A sound like tearing silk filled the air, and the thief sunk onto both knees, clutching the back of his left thigh. He had gone very pale, and was opening and closing his mouth, though no sound came out. Cormac heard footsteps echo around the alley, and he strained his eyes to see his mysterious savior. The footsteps were followed by a rustle, and then a chink as his money pouch landed in front of him. <BR> <BR>“Be more careful in future. I’ll take care of this scum.” <BR> <BR>“Who…?” began Cormac. <BR> <BR>“Hey Cormac!” called Lisa from behind him. “You okay?” <BR> <BR>He glanced behind him. “Yeah, but I wanna…” – he turned back around – “find out…who…I’m…” <BR> <BR>He stopped. The thief and the Kato were gone. Nothing was left but a few drops of blood and the glint of metal. Cormac crouched down. It was a stiletto blade. His hand would have offered no protection against that. Lisa jogged up behind him. <BR> <BR>“Hey, what happened? Our escort’s having a fit, you know.” <BR> <BR>“I’m…not entirely sure.” Distant bells cut through the background noise. “And now we’re late. I’ll tell you later – for now we’d better hurry.” He kicked the blade into the gutter. <BR> <BR>“Fine, let’s go.” <BR> <BR>As they left the alley, Cormac paused and whispered “Thank you…Leon?” . Puzzled at the name thrust into his mind, he hurried away. <BR> <BR>From the pool of darkness, Leon and Harlequin watched them go. <BR> <BR>“His powers are awakening…” Leon muttered. <BR> <BR>Harlequin growled an agreement. <BR> <BR>“It is good that we have found him. Now is the most critical time, and without guidance he has no chance. I…almost pity him. He will suffer much - perhaps die. But if he survives, then…” <BR> <BR>----------------------------- <BR> <BR>“Welcome Ranchers!” boomed Mr. Ghubs. “You are here because you are the brightest and the best! From long time stalwarts like Arithon Vitar” – here he indicated a tall, heavy-set man, who nodded in recognition – “to bright young starts like Cormac McLaughlin and Lisa Hayes” – his other hand gesturing at the two, Cormac reddening slightly, while Lisa just giggled – “you are all destined for further fame and fortune! Will this tournament be a stepping stone to your destiny? By the end of today you’ll know! Now, step out into that arena, and put on a show the likes of which will stay imprinted in the memory of all that see it for the rest of their lives! Prove that you are worthy to be champion of this tournament, and more ahead! Good luck to you all!” <BR> <BR>Polite applause echoed around the large hall. All of the competitors, as well as various journalists, officials and celebrities were present to hear the tournaments opening ceremony. Lisa and Cormac were sitting amidst their rivals. Cormac felt uneasy. <BR> <BR>“I’m not used to all this pomp and pageantry.” He muttered to Lisa. <BR> <BR>“You might have to get used to it.” replied Lisa with a smile. <BR> <BR>Cormac prepared to give a withering response, but Mr. Ghubs’ assistant, Fitzroy, stepped up to the mic. <BR> <BR>“Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Could I ask the participating ranchers to proceed down the stairwell to my left, where they can make their final preparations.” <BR> <BR>As the group marched up the stairwell, Cormac felt a sudden chill run through his body, as though icy fingers were playing on his spine, as he passed the tournament’s benefactor. He glanced in his direction, but the businessman had his back to him and was in animated conversation with his assistant. Cormac shook his head and pressed onwards, ascending the narrow flight of marble steps. <BR> <BR>The stairs led to an open-air room near the top of the stadium. Here, the magnificence of the stadium could be truly seen. <BR> <BR>Kanturk arena was disproportionally large for the sparsely populated region which it occupied. It had been built hundreds of years ago, for some kind of celebration or games which had sadly been lost in the mists of time. As a result, much of the seating was simple stone benches, and it lacked many of the features enjoyed by more modern stadia. However, it more than made up for this with its grandeur. It could easily hold 200,000 people, more than the entire population of Kanturk. Although old, all of its furnishings had been kept in superb condition. <BR> <BR>But even these paled in comparison compared to the arena itself. Due to the decline in fortunes of the area, a small synthetic arena had been used in lieu of the ordinary arena. But for such a monumentous bout, the old arena had been restored to its true magnificence. <BR> <BR>It was almost two acres in area, and had been designed to mimic natural terrain. Or, more accurately, a mixture of natural terrains, for there was a number of small, but perfectly formed, field types. These included plains, desert, woodland, marshland, and gravelly. It was a credit to the original designers that the blending of such a diverse landscape looked completely natural. A number of different obstacles, including boulders, rocks, trees, ditches, hills and, running through the center of the arena, a small river, made battle tactics a necessity. It was a truly unique arena, and one to cause even the most reserved strategists to pause and think carefully over their plans. <BR> <BR>“The first bout will commence in approximately ten minutes.” said Fitzroy, who had followed them up the stairs. “I believe that the combatants are Arithon and Cormac, correct?” <BR> <BR>“That’s right”, said Arithon. For such a large man he had a surprisingly quiet and soft voice. <BR> <BR>“Very good. Please leave here when the bell above the door behind you rings, which will be in about five minutes. You will be paired up with your monsters, who have been given a thorough check-up to ensure they are in peak condition, and then you shall proceed to the arena proper. Until then, refreshments are available on the table to your left. You can view any bouts preceding your own, and we encourage you to talk and get to know your fellow competitors a little better. I wish all of you the best of luck.” <BR> <BR>Fitzroy left the way he came. The door closed with a click. <BR> <BR>“He gives me the creeps.” Muttered Lisa to Cormac. <BR> <BR>“How come?” <BR> <BR>“I dunno…he’s a bit cold and uncaring – he hasn’t shown any emotion at all.” <BR> <BR>Cormac shrugged. <BR> <BR>“Ah well. Nervous yet?” added Lisa with a small grin. <BR> <BR>“A bit.” confessed Cormac. “I just wish I’d get a chance to spend a bit more time with Thenardi beforehand.” <BR> <BR>“Why don’t you head down early then? I’m sure there’d be no problem with being prompt.” <BR> <BR>“Actually, that’s a good idea. I think I will.” <BR> <BR>“Alright then, good...oh, wait...looks like your foe wants to say a few words to you beforehand...” <BR> <BR>Arithon had, indeed, walked over to the two. “Uh…you’re Cormac, right?” <BR> <BR>“Yeah. I guess we’re up next.” Lisa had wandered over to the buffet. <BR> <BR>“True. I look forward to it…I’ve heard a lot about you.” <BR> <BR>“All good, I hope.” <BR> <BR>“Don’t worry, it is. It seems that you’re the ‘next big thing’ in this region. Along with Lisa, of course. Em…I’m assuming was the lady that you were talking to a moment ago.” <BR> <BR>“Wow, that’s amazing. I knew that we were pretty good, but to hear something like that coming from such a pro is…well, very flattering.” <BR> <BR>“Um…you two work co-operatively, correct?” <BR> <BR>“That’s right.” <BR> <BR>“Pardon me for asking, but you two aren’t…er…” <BR> <BR>“Oh no, we’re not ‘er’ at all, just good friends.” <BR> <BR>“Oh, alright. I bet that you get that a lot.” <BR> <BR>Cormac thought for a moment. “Actually…no, not really.” <BR> <BR>Arithon coughed and looked quite embarrassed. Cormac was surprised. Arithon was a veteran rancher – he’d been working with monsters for close to 35 years by now. He was also one of the few trainers from the region to achieve fame outside of Kanturk. Physically, he was in terrific shape as well. He had every reason to be confident, perhaps even arrogant. And yet, standing face to face with the rancher who was used as an example to all of the training youngsters in the region, the trainer who was hot favorite to win the tournament outright, Cormac found him shy and awkward, looking vaguely out of place. “A lot like me…” mused Cormac. <BR> <BR>The small bell began to ring. <BR> <BR>“Oh…I guess that’s us.” said Arithon. He offered his hand. “Good Luck.” <BR> <BR>Cormac shook it. “You too, Ari.” <BR> <BR>Arithon gave him a wry smile, and headed down the narrow corridor to his mantle. <BR> <BR>Lisa hurried over to Cormac, carrying a leg of chicken in one hand, and gave him a bearhug. Lisa was a huggy person. <BR> <BR>“Good Luck!” <BR> <BR>“Much more luck and I think I’ll crack a rib!” gasped Cormac. <BR> <BR>Lisa relinquished him and grinned. <BR> <BR>“Show ‘em what you got!” <BR> <BR>---------------------- <BR> <BR>Cormac entered the underground barn where the competitor’s monsters were being kept. The ceiling was practically vibrating with the stamps of the spectators, and the sound of cheering rumbled through the length of the corridor. The official, a young woman wearing the KMA headband and with a long ponytail, looked up as he approached. <BR> <BR>“Cormac, right?” <BR> <BR>“Yep.” <BR> <BR>“Hang on. I’ll get…Thenardi now.” <BR> <BR>Cormac rocked back and forth on his heels, whistling under his breath. He suddenly wondered whether Thenardi could handle the pressure. As tough as it was for him, it must be worse for his Mew. As soon as Thenardi dashed in, he realized that he needn’t have worried. He was leaping up and down in excitement, his large yellow eyes glowing. <BR> <BR>“Ready?” <BR> <BR>Thenardi nodded and meowled. <BR> <BR>“Let’s go!” <BR> <BR>------------------------- <BR> <BR>Leon crouched on top of one of the roofs which jutted over the stands to give the viewers some protection from the elements. His black jacket fluttered in the breeze, giving him the appearance of a giant crow. Harlequin lay next to him, growling quietly. Leon surveyed the scene below him through a pair of antique binoculars. <BR> <BR>“Let’s see how far his talents have taken him…” <BR> <BR>----------------------------- <BR> <BR>Mr. Ghubs sat back in his own private viewbox, and sipped a glass of red wine. His plans were coming to fruition. Now all he had to do was to sit back and enjoy the show. <BR> <BR>------------------------------ <BR> <BR>Lisa leant against the glass. <BR> <BR>“Come on Cormac, I know you can do this…” <BR> <BR>“Excuse me, miss? You’re Lisa, am I right? <BR> <BR>She turned. “Yeah, but I’m kinda bu-“ She stopped. <BR> <BR>The man who had addressed was stunningly handsome. He looked a little older than he was, with an angelic face, strong grey eyes and golden curls that flowed over his shoulders like a slipped halo. He was dressed in a smart black suit, and was wearing pleasant cologne. Lisa realized she had her mouth open, and closed it hurriedly. <BR> <BR>“Sorry to interrupt, but I felt that I should introduce myself. My name is Neil; I’m to be your first opponent.” <BR> <BR>“Well, the pleasure’s all mine.” She smiled her sweetest smile. <BR> <BR>“I’ve heard you’re something of a prodigy. Is it true you completed the two-year training course in two months?” <BR> <BR>“Actually, it was three. Although, with hindsight, I could’ve pushed myself a little harder – but all work, no play, you know.” <BR> <BR>Neil laughed a rich, almost musical laugh. <BR> <BR>“Well, I’m sure that I have my work cut out for me then. You’re sure to be a formidable foe – though I sincerely hope only on the battlefield.” <BR> <BR>Lisa smiled.  <BR> <BR>“Oh, is that your partner out there now?” <BR> <BR>Lisa stirred from her reverie. “Oh, yes. He’s on the right-hand side.” For reasons beyond her, she quickly added: “We’re good friends.” <BR> <BR>“Indeed. Your friendship must be strong if you both entered the competition.” <BR> <BR>“What do you mean?” <BR> <BR>“Well, surely you’ve considered the possibility of being put in the position where one of you must triumph over the other in order to succeed?” <BR> <BR>“…Sorta…we’ve always just agreed that the person who won deserved to win, and left it at that.” <BR> <BR>“Oh, I’m sure that works for important tournaments. But these are extremely high stakes. Do you think that your friendship could survive such a blow?” <BR> <BR>Lisa opened her mouth to say “Of course”, but found that the words refused to come. Her mind flashed over the arguments they’d had in the two weeks preceding the tournament, and the crushing feeling of defeat when she’d lost to Cormac in previous matches between the two. Her troubled thoughts were interrupted by a roar from the crowd. <BR> <BR>“Oh, it looks like the combatants have emerged.” Commented Neil breezily, seemingly unaware of her discomfort. <BR> <BR>“Oh…alright…” replied Lisa. <BR> <BR>She turned to look out the window and watch her best friend fight the battle of his life, as doubt, an alien emotion to her, clutched at her heart. <BR> <BR>Neil took a sip of wine, and smiled. <BR> <BR>---------------------------- <BR> <BR>Cormac blinked in the bright  sunlight as the noise of the crowd hit him like a hammer. He slowly walked up the steps of the marble pedestal where he could see over the entire arena. A brass loudspeaker allowed him to communicate with his monster over a large distance, but Cormac had given him his instructions before the bout, and trusted his Mew to be able to fight on his own if needed. <BR> <BR>As he reached the zenith of the pedestal, the atmosphere washed over him. Here he was, standing in one of the grandest arenas in the world, at one of the biggest tournaments held in this area for years, and hundreds of thousands of people were cheering him on. The scene was completely intoxicating – he felt a little dizzy at the whole realization of his position. <BR> <BR>He clutched the marble handrail around the edge of the pedestal. No, he had to stay in control; otherwise he wouldn’t stand a chance. It was so tempting to succumb, but his determination, bordering on stubbornness, would hold him fast. <BR> <BR>“Alright, Monster fans!” boomed the voice of the commentator from the loudspeakers in the four corners of the arena. “Welcome to the opening bout of the KMA centurial tournament! Before we start this battle-fest, we have to point out some safety notes to ensure your…” <BR> <BR>Cormac let his mind wander as various rules and guidelines were announced to the frenzied crowd, who promptly forgot them. A stab of intuition made him glance upwards. A lance of sunlight glinted off something on the roof. He squinted, trying to make out what it was. He thought he could see a patch of black… <BR> <BR>“…Cormac McLaughlin, and his Mew Thenardi!!!” cut in the commentator. An explosion of applause shook the arena to its foundations. Cormac blinked, realizing he was being announced. He gave a cautious wave to the stands around him, and the cheers reached the pain threshold of noise. <BR> <BR> <BR>“And his opponent, another Kanturk-region trainer, Arithon Vitar and his golem, Balkaroth!!!” another wave of applause swept through the crowd. Cormac could make out Arithon smiling at him, and he nodded slightly. Thenardi walked about 20 yards in front of Cormac, and viewed his opponent. Balkaroth looked in superb shape. It was slim and muscular, and had sharpness in its eyes unusual for a golem. Thenardi and Cormac had a real fight on their hands. <BR> <BR>“Now, may we have quiet in the crowd so that the trainers can give their monsters correct commands, please?” <BR> <BR>A deathly hush fell over the arena. It seems as though to Cormac that the whole world was holding its breath. A sudden finality came over him. This was it. His destiny was in his hands, and it was up to him to realize it. <BR> <BR>The bell clanged. <BR> <BR>“FIGHT!!!” <BR> <BR>---------------------------------------- <BR>I hate to leave it at such a dramatic climax, but I like to leave something to keep the audiance coming back :&#41;. Again, any suggesitons, questions or comments are welcome.
