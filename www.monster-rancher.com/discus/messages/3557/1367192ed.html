The 3 rangers were running from the the green mist. Everything in it&#39;s path would die of poisoning. Zagref was still thinking, &#34;how could I have been fooled?&#34; Behind them, Mahjor&#39;s minions were chasing them.  <BR> <BR>     &#34;Zagref, we have to get to IMa territory. That is the only area that hasn&#39;t been populated by Mahjor!&#34; Soluv said. The Rangers were reaching IMa, which turned from a peaceful raising country, to a secret battle base against Mahjor. They reached the Gates into the country. There, they were greeted by Songi, a very powerful Golem/General. &#34;Zagref, good to see you again. Ever since the Devil Gene was discovered and destroyed a century ago, things slowed down. But now, we must destroy Mahjor. Our scientists say that Mahjor is the most powerful monster with the devil gene. He is the devil himself. I&#39;m afraid that my army isn&#39;t going to be strong enough to finish him off. Last time, we got lucky.&#34; <BR> <BR>     Solon looked around. He saw others preparing for the iminant threat of Mahjor. &#34;Mahjor isn&#39;t going to win. He can&#39;t, and we won&#39;t allow it. Your men can take out the ones already manipulated. The strongest ones will work with us to take out the Great Betrayer, or should I say, Hijora, our fallen friend. As well as the devil himself, Mahjor.&#34; Zagref, with defiance, said to the others. <BR> <BR>     The hours passed, every minute, filled the Warriors woth fear. Everyone tried to sleep, waiting for hell in the morning. Zagref actually slept. He, again dreamed with Lot. <BR> <BR>     &#34;Zagref, you have come far. You will fight a very bloody battle. Most will die, I cannot tell you who is going to come out victor. But I will help you. Mahjor will destry very much of the area. He will get desparate. He will try everything he can. Eventually, I will come from out of the ground, and I will battle Mahjor. You, and only you must battle the Betrayer. the others must fight the manipulated ones. Only you can defeat the Betrayer. Goodbye, Zagref. Goodbye........&#34; <BR> <BR>     Zagref awoke. He told the General about it, as well as the Rangers. &#34;We must prepare for him. If Lot is coming, Mahjor should be the last <I>one</I>. Lot will finish the Devil Gene for good. Lot is the most powerful being, right?&#34; Songi said. Then, the horns blew, which meant that Mahjor was close. &#34;Everyone, BATTLE STATIONS!!! Get in your groups! Remain in your flanks! Prepare for HELL!!!!&#34; The General Shouted in the mike. Everyone got in their positions. Then, like the General said, all HELL broke loose. The warriors were actually defeating Mahjor&#39;s minions. Mahjor stood above, watching. Monster blood was flying everywhere. there was death taking place.  <BR>  <BR>     Zagref met with Hijora. &#34;Hello, <I>leader</I>.&#34; Hijora said, mockingly. &#34;Hijora, prepare to die. I will kill you for betraying me. Mahjor can&#39;t protect you now.&#34; Zagref said. Hijora laughed. &#34;You can&#39;t defeat me, even without Mahjor&#39;s help. You don&#39;t have the power to even scratch me. Zagref shouted, and launched Vulcan fire at Hijora. He dodged it easily, and sent it back 10-fold. Zagref used a Vulcan shield, which deflcted the fire. Hijora used a dimension portal. Their conflict lasted for a while. Eventually, they both got tired. &#34;You still can&#39;t defeat me, Zagref!&#34; Hijora said. &#34;Ha! The mighty Hijora, looks tired. You can&#39;t defeat me, not without Mahjor. Your weak.&#34; Zagref said. <BR> <BR>     Then, everything got silent. The ground was coming apart. Suddenly, a very shiny monster arose. Once everyone got adjusted to the light, they saw who it was. It was a Durahan. Shiny gold armor, Shiny silver blade, a helmet the shape of a Gali, and a shiny blue shield. It was <B>LOT</B>! <BR> <BR>     &#34;Mahjor, you have been terrorizing my land for years. Now you must die.&#34; Lot came to Mahjor. He clashed blades with Mahjor. Mahjor&#39;s Sythe, vs. Lot&#39;s Silver Sword. This battle was the biigest clash of the century. <BR> <BR>To be continued.......

 Your story&#39;s really progressing Sturnum. I hope that you hadn&#39;t intended for lot to be a Gali until you read my story. I didn&#39;t want to interfere with yours.

 No, I never actually meant to put the Gali mask as his helmet, but I just thought it would be cool, since Mahjor is a Joker.
