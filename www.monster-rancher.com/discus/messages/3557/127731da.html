 Chapter 13:The coming of Moo <BR> <BR>&#34;We captured him, as you commanded.&#34;Flood bowed low before the Masters shadow, the salamander Zarzaas behind him. Before them stood a Trident, chained and bound, in the utter darkness that was the masters chamber. It had been only been an hour since Shielka&#39;s imprisonment. After declaring Moo&#39;s death as priority one, Flood was ordered on a lesser mission and in record time caught his prey. It was easy to find the Naga type, the master had told flood exactly where to look. Subdueing the monster and taking him alive was anouther matter all together. It had been a hard battle but the pressure managed to overpower his enemy with some help from Zarzaas. Now, rubbing the long, painful scar that traveled from his neck to his waist, Flood awaited the masters approval. <BR> <BR>&#34;Indeed, you&#39;ve done well.&#34;The Master didn&#39;t sound very pleased dispite his words. That voice which was always so sharp and decisive seemed preoccupied at the moment.&#34;Welcome Stone claw.....&#34; <BR> <BR>The Trident became alert instantly. That was a voice he&#39;d heard before.&#34;The Master?&#34;He said with great uneasyness.&#34;I dreamed you.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;A dream? Not quite,&#34;Master replied&#34;I reached into your mind as you slept. I sense that you will make a fine addition to our....family. Was he alone?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes,&#34;Flood replied and that news seemed to relieve Claw. They all noticed, the Trident had been far more tense a moment ago.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I know you well Claw.&#34;The Master continued,&#34;You must now join us, and serve me. Together we shall reap the fruits of a new age. As the reign of humanity crumbles our time is dawning. Join us...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Serve you?&#34;He replied&#34;Yes...Yes I will serve you! Let all that stand in our way be cut down! Hahahahahaha!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;......Why?&#34;The Master asked suddenly and his warriors stood baffled. What was wrong? Is this not the response the Master wanted.&#34;Why do I sense that you do not speak the truth??&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Because I&#39;m lying jackass!&#34;Stone claw hissed&#34;You really think I&#39;m gonna serve you an your revolution crap!? I serve no one, I do things the way I want to do them and joining forces with a lunatic ain&#39;t on todays agenda!&#34; <BR> <BR>Suddenly both Flood and Zarzaas were upon him, beating the life out of the helpless trident. Meanwhile the master watched from the shadows, enjoying very twich of pain that crossed claws face, every agonizing blow. He could not remember when one had spoken to him in this way. The master made his decision, he wanted this one. It wouldn&#39;t take long to bend his mind to the Masters will. Commanding his followers to stop, he ordered claw to be imprisoned until moo was taken care of. <BR> <BR>At last, after draging his limp body for what seemed an eternity, Stone claw was thrown into a cell. The two foot thick doors slamed shut and an electronic lock of sorts beeped. It was several minutes before he was conscious enough to realize he was caged. His eyes cast about the cell looking for anything, anyway to escape. During his time locked up at the ranch this didn&#39;t bother him, in fact he&#39;d grown to except it almost. But after tasting free air once again he couldn&#39;t go back to this. Claw paniced, slashing and clawing at the metal walls, no effect. He tried to dig out through the floor, solid. At last he began hurling himself at the doors, again and again, each time doing considerable damage to himself and not even scratching the door. Finally, he moved back as far as he could, about to make one last desperate charge, when a voice called to him from the next cell. <BR> <BR>&#34;Give it up,&#34;Said a depressed female voice.&#34;Those doors are unbreakable and electronicly sealed, impossible to escape.....&#34; Claw stoped and, rising up on his tail, looked through a metal grating on the left wall. He could see a Daina in the next cell, siting down and stareing at the doors. Then she added in the most dismal tone imaginable,&#34;It&#39;s hopeless.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hopeless indeed!&#34;Laughed yet anouther voice from outside. Claw remembered that voice well and that evil laughter. It was the lilim Jakira, she was standing outside the daina&#39;s cell.&#34;So, how are you traitor?&#34; The daina made no replie and only turned away. <BR> <BR>&#34;Is that how it is?&#34;Jakira smiled&#34;You know, I never liked you anyway. The masters alittle distracted with this moo business but when he&#39;s done...he&#39;s gonna skin you alive and then stuff your carcass into the meatgrinder. You can be sure I&#39;ll be there to witness every second. A beautiful act really, a most artistic death in my opinion. You know, if done correctly we can keep you alive until the very last slice. My only wish is that you live just long enough to feel the grinder, i&#39;ve never seen that before! Well, see you then, Hahahaha!&#34; <BR> <BR>The lilim left and some time passed, claw felt the need to escape once again and tried to think of something to take his mind off it. &#34;So...you worked for the master?&#34;He asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;.......yes,&#34;The Daina said&#34;I&#39;d love to kill that insane....&#34;Her voice trailed off.&#34;What am I saying? I&#39;m done for and so are you if you don&#39;t join.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m not joining,&#34;He said proudly&#34;I&#39;ll die before someone else rules my life again...by the way, names Stone claw.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Stone claw?&#34;Daina replied&#34;A human must have given you that name, mine is Shielka.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Not too original but it suits me,&#34;Claw said. Suddenly he heard the footsteps of someone darting down the hall before stopping in front of his cell. He reared up, and, looking through the bars above his door he could hardly believe who it was.... <BR> <BR> <BR>The ominous Dark raven fled, the clouds seemed to part and close again, covering it&#39;s escape. Justice had watched, mystified as the cloaked stranger before him disbatched the minons. Torlormec was still standing, the armies of IMA, in spite of heavy loses, had done their job. No civiliens had been slain in the fierce battle that threatened to consume them. Damage to the city was also negligible. The stranger stared searchingly at justice for a moment before turning away. Justice wasn&#39;t about to let him escape however, he needed answers. Who was this person, why was he here? Why did the Master retreat at the sight of him? The durahan walked up behind him and the cloaked one sensed his approach. <BR> <BR>&#34;Stay back.&#34;He warned. <BR> <BR>&#34;Who are you?&#34;Justice asked, ignoring him.&#34;You clearly don&#39;t serve the master, and you bare not the crest of Moo.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Go home,&#34;He replied.&#34;This situtation will be settled soon enough, there is nothing you can do here. One way or anouther, all will be well in a few days....but if it pleases you, my name is Raa-zor.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We&#39;re fighting the Master too,&#34;Celine said&#34;Let us help.&#34; <BR> <BR>Raa-zor turned and looked at the three monsters standing before him and almost laughed out loud. &#34;You have no idea of what you face. Fight if you must, but it will lead to your deaths. I have seen it countless times, you are are sorely outmatched by this foe.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Then, if you know so much...&#34;Justice said&#34;Tell us, what are we dealing with? How can we stop the master?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You can not,&#34;Raa-zor said, matter of factly&#34;Only me and my kin can defeat this enemy, you can only stand aside and let come what may. Now, as I said before, return to where ever you crawled from...i have wasted far to much time talking to animals.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Animals?&#34;Justice drew his sword but then felt the heavy hand of Ganthor on his shoulder. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hold on! Hey, look at that!&#34;The stronghorn pointed a massive finger toward the sun. Justice stared up, using a steel hand to block the suns painful glare. At first, he could see nothing except the eternal burning of the golden orb. Then he saw it, a black shape in the sky. At first he thought it was the Raven returning to finish it&#39;s work, but as it came closer he realized it wasn&#39;t.  <BR> <BR>Finally it came into clear view, a great, black star falling from the heavens. It was twice the size of the dark raven, slowly desending upon the city of torlormec. A huge mass of cruel spikes and ebony spires, it&#39;s bulk blocking the suns rays. It cast down it&#39;s shadow onto the city as onlookers gasped in horror. Even the raven had not instilled the kind of terror that this tainted star had done. The thing looked dark, unholy, as if one would be turned to darkness merely by looking at it. It&#39;s very presence seemed to chill the air as the people of the city realized what they gazed upon. The floating fortress of Moo himself. <BR> <BR>Panic, wide spread and sudden, grasped the city. People ran about Torlormec screaming as though death was but moments away. In the confusion justice realized that Raa-zor had slipped away and was now nowhere to be seen. Then, making his way through the crowds the zuum begras appeared. <BR> <BR>&#34;Moo himself has come,&#34;He said with a frightened glance at the fortress.&#34; What are our orders? Do we retreat?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No, help fortify the city in case it attacks.&#34;Justice ordered and both ganthor and celine gave him a questioning look. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey man, your pretty calm considering moo&#39;s about to blow us up!&#34;Ganthor said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes and what do you mean in case it attacks?&#34;Celine asked&#34;This is moo we&#39;re talking about, of course he&#39;ll attack!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I think he has more important things on his mind then wiping out cities these days,&#34;Justice said&#34;If he wanted to attack we&#39;d be dead by now.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You...&#34;Said a voice from behind them. The trio turned and saw a powerful looking tiger with a magnificent coat of silver-grey fur. His eyes cold and calculating, trained upon justice alone.&#34;I am Grey Wolf...I come in the name of Moo....&#34;
