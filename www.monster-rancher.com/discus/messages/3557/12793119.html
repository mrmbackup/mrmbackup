 Jace, Roketh, and Vyger all walked the lonely mountain path known as Lager Hill. It was said that a legendary battle had raged here. One known as Denemaur became victorious in a long and horrific bout between himself and one called Dragonaught. The three walked the path while Jace enlightened them with the myth. <BR> <BR>&#34;You see,&#34; he began, &#34;Denemaur was a Golem type and Dragnaught was a Dragon type. Yet both were considered freaks, abnormal creatures such as yourselfs.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You callin&#39; us freaks old man?&#34; Vyger said with a glare. <BR> <BR>&#34;Not at all. These two were both terrible monsters. Burning towns and crushing all the lie before them. Supposedly, it was a huge draw. Legend played it that Denemaur won. We may never know but, Denemaur was a Golem type. Pressure is a Golem type. He may be the one we are looking for.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Roketh stared into the distance as he said, &#34;Maybe, but you said he was an evil creature. He may be the new evil that I wasd destined to defeat.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Roketh, let me tell you something,&#34; Jace said as he patted the large monster on his leg, &#34;The future is a blank board, a glob of clay. Depends on hnow you draw it and mold it that makes your life. You may win and think you were destined to win, but if you just sit around, you will lose.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I understand.&#34; Roketh said looking down on the human. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hear that?&#34; Vyger raised his heads, &#34;Sounds like...battle? I thought these mountains were deserted?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, some trainers do like to make matches personal. Here they fight to the death sometimes.&#34; Jace replied, &#34;Probably just dueling trainers.&#34; <BR> <BR>Over the next hill, a horrid sight was before them. A battlefield, carnage every where. Death was the only stench left. Dead Pressures and Tyrants lay everywhere. Four fought in the middle of the two fallen armies. Two on two from the looks of it. One was a Pressure, no doubt a general. He was completely black, with two red eyes. At his side was a Durahan made of solid diamond, with pure gold trim. They were faceing off with two very odd looking dragons. One&#39;s legs and waste were completely armoured and the rest of his body was slightly armoured. The other was completely blue and had four arms. On each hand was a black glove, with a few studs on the back of them. It was hard to tell who was wining. <BR> <BR>&#34;Should we stop them?&#34; Jace asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;No. Let them kill each other. We will destroy whoever survives.&#34; Vyger stated with a grin on all three heads. <BR> <BR>&#34;We can&#39;t. If one of those four is one of the eight lords, we&#39;d have problems. Especially if he lost.&#34; Roketh said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, lets just watch it a while and let them tire out. We&#39;ll take them prisoner a whole lot easier.&#34; Vyger said as he stared at the clashing monsters. They were un-noticed at the moments. Each side had their hands completely full. They were close enough to hear them screaming at each other. <BR> <BR>&#34;Denemaur, how long has it been? Ready for round two?&#34; Dragonaught said with a sidistic grin. <BR> <BR>&#34;Dragonaught you make me sick. I will defeat you once again if I must. Your army is crushed and you hold not a candle to my inferno.&#34; The Pressure said, obviously Denemaur. <BR> <BR>&#34;It is they. A rematch? They are still alive?&#34; Vyger said a bit stunned. <BR> <BR>&#34;Obviously in good shape as well.&#34; Roketh added as they continued to watch the waring factions. <BR> <BR>&#34;Denemaur you under-estimate me. I am stronger, blessed with the masters dark spirits I am. Death awaits you now, old foe. Galin, you take that little Durahan. The Pressure is mine.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;How dare you call the Lord of Combat little? I am the master of weapons and warfare. I, Bloodlust, will have you destroied.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t make me laugh, Bloodlust. You forget, YOUR quarrel lies with me, Galin. I am one of the Dark Lords. Now you will feel our wrath.&#34; <BR> <BR>They then paired off. Each watching their opposite. They got a good distance from one another before they began to fight. They launched themselves simultaneously at their opposition. Jace decided to watch Denemaur and Dragonaught&#39;s rematch. Dragonaught swung one swipe from overhead. Denemaur dodged and landed a crushing blow to the back of the Dark Lord with an axehandle type attck. Dragonaught rolled out of the way of the foot as it crashed a huge crater into the ground. Dragonaught rose and pointed an open fist at the Pressure as it looked up, and shot a massive energy orb into its head. Denemaur stumbled back and landed on his back after tripping over a dead Tyrant. He looked up to see his foe comeing from strait above. He raised his hands over his face, as if to catch the falling Dragon. Then, a slight pulse ring began to emit from his palms in a horizontal manner. They began to resemble waves. Dragonaught seemed to realize this and tried to stop himself in the air. When he finally did, it was to late. <BR> <BR>&#34;TYPHOON CRUSHER!&#34; Denemaur screamed and, in the same instance, Dragonaught was heard screaming as well, &#34;NO!&#34; <BR> <BR>A massive colum of water erupted from his palms. Shooting strait up with such force, the Pressure was pushed deeper into the ground. Dragonaught tried to block the attack by covering his face with his wings. The twoer of steaming water began to swril into a giant water tornado. Which in turn, became a mini-hurricane. The Dragon was tossed about like a doll. When the storm subsided, the Pressure was deep within the earth, in an imprint of himself. He was obviously worn out, and his foe was doing no better. Dragonaught was stumbling towards Denemaur as he rose from his crevice. Jace then looked over at the other two. They were both laid out on the battlefield. The Durahan was on his side, trying to catch his breath. Galin was on his back, his face smoking from either and energy blast or breathing fire. <BR> <BR>Something then clouded the sky. A shadow fell over all four of them. A huge beast landed a little ways above them. He watched them and without saying a word, spread his wings wide. His two minons disappeared, leaving the two ingored monsters to find for themselves. <BR> <BR>Roketh stared at the monster who was about his size, except for some very distinct features. He stared in awe at the beast before finally he said, &#34;...the Evil?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Stay tuned. Enjoy! CHB
