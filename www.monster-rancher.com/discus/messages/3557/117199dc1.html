Here it comes! Chap 6 of the MDA. New thrills, chills, and spills! Hope you like it! <BR> <BR>The MDA Chap 6: The Return of the Sasuke Army <BR> <BR>The door made the sound of nails on a chalkboard as Zena pushed it aside. Kala had to cover her ears, it was so painful. The door was oak, and had many scratches and bruises on the surface. A chill went down Kala’s spine. She thought the room was a torture chamber, and the scratches were those of unlucky monsters being dragged into certain doom. <BR> <BR>“This way,” beckoned Zena. <BR> <BR>Kala followed her into a jet black room. The ceilings were flooded with cobwebs, and the floor felt damp as Kala pressed her already frozen feet onto it. She stepped forward, and looked around. <BR> <BR>“Oh my god…” <BR> <BR>The room was full of countless torture devices. The pendulum ax slept in the corner, a chair with nails protruding from the surface stood to the right, to the left, stood the bed with ropes used for stretching bodies out, and in the center of the room, stood the friendly guillotine with a spackle of blood on the tip of the blade. <BR> <BR>Kala was about to run for it, but Zena grabbed her arm. Kala struggled to break free. <BR> <BR>“Don’t worry missy,” she said, easing up on the pressure to Kala’s arm, “You won’t be testing any of these today.” <BR> <BR>Zena smiled, and Kala smiled back, relieved. Then, she saw a large black door in the back of the room. The Whizring and Allure stepped forward and made for the door. <BR> <BR>“Whatever is beyond that door,” Kala thought, “I will meet it head on…” <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>Keemo stared at the guards confronting him. The crowds let out a loud boo, but when Writhe emerged from the gate, they silenced. He approached Keemo, and in the process squashed the Garu’s severed head. The audience all let out a loud groan. <BR> <BR>“I am pleased to inform you,” Writhe began, “That I trust you. You have strength beyond that of a Raiden, I am impressed. Come, we will discuss the matter at hand in my quarters.” <BR> <BR>With that, Writhe spun his cloak around and made his way for the exit. Keemo followed, and noticed the crowds filling out of the stadium. They made their way down into the bowels of the coliseum. Keemo noticed the granite walls lined with various weapons and armor. As they continued on, they reached a series of cells. Each one contained a monster. However, they weren’t mistreated. They had fine furniture, and a bell, obviously for room service.  <BR> <BR>“I get it,” thought Keemo, “Writhe doesn’t send his own men into combat. He houses monsters in need and gives them food in return for their combat in the coliseum.” He then noticed a key on the sides of each cell. “They could leave at anytime, but probably can’t return.” <BR> <BR>After they left the coliseum, Keemo walked through a series of tunnels. Busy monsters roamed from room to room, obviously doing some type of research.  <BR> <BR>After about ten minutes of walking through busy hallways, Keemo noticed that the action had died down, and that only guards at each door were in sight. Then, at the end, there was a passage with no guards. <BR> <BR>Writhe strolled into it, and Keemo hesitated, and then followed. There was light coming from the end of the tunnel, and soon they stepped into a large garden. Keemo couldn’t believe how green it was for a cave. There were carrots, potatoes, beats, and other assorted vegetables. <BR> <BR>“Lord Writhe,” Keemo began, “Why is this place unguarded?” <BR> <BR>“Why, this is my private garden. None of the Black Hand members dare set a foot inside these walls. It’s not against the rules, they just don’t do it,” Writhe spoke to Keemo as if they had been friends forever. He obviously trusted him. <BR> <BR>As they walked further into the vegetation, Keemo noticed a small house at the end of the cavern. It looked cozy enough. Writhe pushed aside the straw in front of the entrance, and lit a lantern, illuminating the entire house. Keemo pushed aside the straw, and stepped inside. <BR> <BR>The house contained large furniture and doorways, as it would be hard for a Beerock. Keemo sat down in a small armchair, and Writhe brought out a kettle of tea. <BR> <BR>“Why do you treat me so well?” asked Keemo as he spread his wings comfortably along the red wood arms of the leather chair. <BR> <BR>“Because you have proven yourself, and I have put you through our coliseum. You deserve a good rest. After all, not many people are the same after they’ve killed ten monsters.” <BR> <BR>Keemo remembered his bloody experience, and burst with rage. <BR> <BR>“How can you do something so awful? How can you force monsters to fight to the death right before your eyes? How can you let your gang cheer at the sight of blood?” Keemo yelled. <BR> <BR>“I understand you anger,” said Writhe as he poured tea into two cups, “But rest assured it’s for a good reason. You see, many fear combat and war. Rookies on the battlefield usually chicken out, but not ones from my clan. Think of the coliseum as a training gadget. It trains my men in the art of combat. With the coliseum, my warriors learn to embrace battle. So if they don’t fear combat in the coliseum, they won’t fear it on the battlefield.” <BR> <BR>Keemo was shocked. It was brilliant. If no one in Writhe’s clan feared battle, they had an obvious advantage over other groups if it came down to violence.  <BR> <BR>“Now,” began Writhe as he handed Keemo the tea, “I’m sure you have lots of questions.” <BR> <BR>The large Beerock took a seat in an over sized sofa as he took a sip of his tea. He waited for Keemo to ask questions. <BR> <BR>“Why did you give me a weapon down there?” Keemo asked, “If you wanted to see my strength, why didn’t you make me fight with my own two fists, or, wings in my case?” <BR> <BR>“You see, Keemo, I am not as stupid as some other breeds of Beaklon. I know of a Raiden’s physical strength. It would have been too easy for you to fight with your wings. You would have easily overpowered the samurai. If you have a sword, it limits your abilities,” Writhe smiled as Keemo took in his answer. <BR> <BR>“Of course, why didn’t I see it before?” Keemo said. <BR> <BR>“Yes, Keemo,” the large Beerock paused to take a sip of his tea, “I am very old, but I’ve still got a few tricks up my sleeve. But now, let’s talk business. I know you were sent here thinking the Black Hand was up to something, please, enlighten me on this predicament. <BR> <BR>With that, Keemo explained everything. The cell phone, the mysterious voice, and how Onslaught had captured him. <BR> <BR>“Hmmmmm…” Writhe though in silence for a moment, then spoke up, “It sounds like you have been set up, but the question is, by whom?” <BR> <BR>“Well,” Keemo began, “It is probably one of your enemies.” <BR> <BR>“Why do you think this?” <BR> <BR>“Why else would they send me after you? If you were arrested under false charges, you’d be out of the way. Your mines are worth billions, and I’m sure many people are just waiting for you to leave so they can walk right in,” the Raiden finally took a sip of his tea, and looked up at Writhe. <BR> <BR>“It seems we are allies the,” Writhe said, “We have a common enemy, and I will help you find him.” <BR> <BR>Writhe extended his claw. Keemo took it with his wing, and they shook. <BR> <BR>“Welcome, temporarily, to the Black Hand.” <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>Jango awoke in a dark room. He had no idea where he was. Had he been killed? Was this heaven? Or worse… <BR> <BR>Just then, the door was thrown open, and two ninja stepped forward. <BR> <BR>“You, Metal Jell, the master wishes to see you!” One spoke. <BR> <BR>Jango was roughly pulled up from the floor, and tried to slide out, but couldn’t. The ninjas were wearing gloves with great traction, and they held fast to Jango’s slippery skin. He then felt the pain in his heart, and bent over. He vomited as the ninja took him out of the darkness and into the light. He was dragged through numerous hallways, and soon realized where he was. <BR> <BR>“This is an ancient Japanese palace,” he muttered. <BR> <BR>The ninja turned and slapped him across the face. <BR> <BR>“You will speak when spoken to, understand?!” the ninja kicked his heart and Jango let out a scream, and then passed out. <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>Kala watched as Zena opened the door into the unknown chamber. It was well lit, and there were no torture devices inside. Both the Allure and the Whizring stepped forward. <BR> <BR>“Why have you come, Zena?” demanded a deep voice from the back of the room. <BR> <BR>“The Allure, she is awake,” squeaked Zena, she was terrified. <BR> <BR>“Why do I care? There are important issues to be attended to an…” <BR> <BR>“She is Kala of the MDA!” interrupted Zena. The voice halted. <BR> <BR>“Interesting,” the voice now sounded amused, “Bring her in, but don’t follow her, I wish to speak with her, <I>alone</I>.” <BR> <BR>Zena shoved Kala forward, then whispered, “Good luck, you’ll need it.” <BR> <BR>With that, the door slammed shut, and the voice called out, “Come closer, my dear.” <BR> <BR>Kala did as she was told. She stepped forward, and soon saw a throne at the end of the room. The monster in it stood, and began its way towards her, then stopped. <BR> <BR>“Why have you come here?” the voice demanded. Kala was silent, and this angered the voice. <BR> <BR>“I said; why are you here?”  <BR> <BR>Kala squelched herself. The voice screamed, and Kala backed against the wall. <BR> <BR>“CLANG!” <BR> <BR>“AHHHHHH!” <BR> <BR>Kala screamed as the scythe bit into the wall right next to her neck. Kala instantly thought, Joker, but then realized the blades of the scythe were slanted. The figure came out of the darkness. There was a blue robe with metal hands and a silver mask. It extended a hand, and the scythe tore from the wall and landed back in the hand. <BR> <BR>“I don’t believe it,” Kala began, “You’re the Ghars who saved me.” <BR> <BR>The Ghars let out a hoarse laugh. <BR> <BR>“My name is Flare, and yes, I did save you. You see, I used to be a master of torture, and people know of my reputation. I now love scaring the crap of people and monsters,” it said sarcastically. Then Flare became serious. <BR> <BR>“Why have you come to the Kalaragi?” <BR> <BR>Kala saw no point in resisting, so she told Flare the entire story. <BR> <BR>“I see,” he said, “Well, I can assure you, the Black Hand has done nothing wrong.” <BR> <BR>“What do you want me to do?” Kala asked. <BR> <BR>“I want you to leave this place,” began Flare. Kala lowered her head, but then Flare spoke, “I want you to save your friend, Jango, was it?” <BR> <BR>Kala shot her head up. <BR> <BR>“What happened to him?” <BR> <BR>“He almost died trying to save one of my men, Sear, who died at the hands of the Sasuke Army. He has been captured , and taken hostage. He is being held in Kawrea. They have an old palace under the volcano. I’ve already dispatched team of my most trusted Joker, but I want you to join them.” <BR> <BR>With that, Kala opened her purple wings, and soared into the night sky. After about an hour, she could make out a squad of black robes with scythes hovering over the trees. Then, she saw the large volcano, and a Japanese temple. <BR> <BR>“I’m coming, Jango…”

 I thought that Ninja and Samurai traditionally didn&#39;t get along too well? Now they both are part of the Sasuke Army? <BR> <BR>Other than that, great addition. I can tell you like Jokers.

 Well, CHB, you&#39;re half right. Sometimes ninja and samurai didn&#39;t get along. However, the emperor commanded both ninja and samurai, if they serve the same person...Oops! giving away too much of the future fer this story. Thanks fer the comments every1!
