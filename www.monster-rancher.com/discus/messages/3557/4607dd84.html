 Roketh held his scythe with an unrelenting grip of utter rage now. The suffering of all of Kronock&#39;s victims have been revealed, as well as their horrid fates. He cringed slightly as a cold chill shot through him at the thoughts of eternal damnation. To be lost in a pit of evil, crowded with a sinister monstrosity&#39;s victims, all crammed wall to wall with you. A hell beyond hell, a fate worse than death. Now, all that Roketh had known and all he cared about and then some, all gone. Moonshadow and Galin each lay helplessly on the ground; each fought to their brink. Roketh now stood against the final form of Kronock, who now had encompassed his former ally, Dadge. The armor had been damaged in the explosion, but was still mostly intact. A square dent resided in a circular dent in the chest plate, signs of Dadge&#39;s battle with him. Roketh&#39;s eyes blurred. The light in them changed several times over, and kept flashing. <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you ready…to die…fool.&#34; Kronock&#39;s words were long, drawn out and raspy. He almost sounded like he had asthma, but Kronock knew it was because the power overwhelmed him. <BR> <BR>Roketh ran towards him with a vengeance. He lifted his scythe above his head as the tears began running down his face. Kronock raised his left arm, attempting to block it with his forearm armor. The scythe hit and sparks flew like liquid fire. They ran off the blade as it met the armor, the flame rain slightly burned Roketh&#39;s knee, but he couldn&#39;t look down for that. He and Kronock stared into each other&#39;s eye, piercing them with their utter hate for each other. <BR> <BR>&#34;Tears…Roketh? Are you…that…scared?&#34; Kronock said as he pushed against the demon scythe. <BR> <BR>&#34;No, old foe, I cry for all those you destroyed and imprisoned. More than that…&#34; Roketh said as he pushed down harder, &#34;I cry for you, and what I&#39;m going to do to you.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh pulled back his scythe quickly, the friction against the arm plate sparked massively. A bright flash flooded through Kronock&#39;s eyes. He grabbed his face in reflex. Suddenly, a loud clang rang out, and Kronock felt a sharp pain in his stomach. He spun once, then turned toward Roketh, or where he thought he was. Then, a large Dragon foot was planted into his back. Kronock fell flat on his face, quit enraged. He began to regain his sight now. As he stood, he turned to see Roketh flying towards him. He was half turned, his scythe closely behind him. Kronock knew how to work this armor now that Dadge was with him. All but one blade had been completely used up, but the jetpack was still intact. <BR> <BR>Roketh thought he was about to end it now, then Kronock shot into the air, a blinding current of dust and smoke behind him. How did the jetpack survive the explosion? He couldn&#39;t ponder it much beyond that point; the mechanics were too much for him. Now, he had to catch Kronock in the air, and not let him get the advantage. <BR> <BR>Kronock turned to see a large, rather unruly Dragon pursuing him. He turned in mid air and barreled toward Roketh. The blade on his back left arm was still working. He powered it up, and was ready to use it. Roketh readied his weapon as the two flew at each other in the deadliest form of chicken imaginable. <BR> <BR>Galin pulled himself over to Moonshadow. The Terror Dog merely gazed at the aerial conflict in awe. The two sped past each other, turned, and did it again. Each time, the sound of clashing metal sounded. Galin got within earshot of Moonshadow before he ran out of energy. <BR> <BR>&#34;You…are you…ok?&#34; Galin muttered weakly, but if anyone could hear him, it would be a Tiger breed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Moonshadow spoke back, never taking his eyes from the sky. His coat was now back to black; the blood had mostly hardened now, stiffening his fur into small, shard-like projections. He continued to speak, though he was also becoming weaker, &#34;I did lose a lot of blood though…&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin partly chuckled to himself, wondering if this is what Grendel meant. That old Jill was lending all his power now, they all were. Galin rolled over and stared at the star lit sky. It seemed two shooting stars were battling over a wish. Galin laughed to himself slightly, hurting with every rise and fall of his giant shoulders. Yet, still he told himself, &#34;I ain&#39;t dead yet…&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh had been slashed from his right shoulder, diagonal to his left hip. Not a deep wound, but it did hamper him slightly. Kronock had received a slash across his waist, just under his armor. They both continued to fight at full speed. One fateful pass, Roketh spun to hit Kronock in the back. Imagine his shock to see Kronock doing to same thing. Roketh had already raised his scythe, and Kronock capitalized. Roketh spun wildly through the air as a large, red foot print appeared on his face. Kronock had managed to boost a decent bit before shutting it off and spinning in midair, drop kicking Roketh in the mouth. Roketh tried to regain his momentum, but he received another dual-foot present from Kronock in his back. Roketh spiraled into the hard earth. It gave very little, cracking at least three ribs. Roketh glanced up as Kronock landed quite gracefully for his appearance. <BR> <BR>&#34;Give up…you should…&#34; Kronock gasped out, he may have very well been winded now. <BR> <BR>&#34;Would you?&#34; Roketh asked as a slight stream of blood fell from his lip. <BR> <BR>Kronock only giggled to himself in all his glee as he strolled to Roketh&#39;s newfound hole. Roketh struggled to his feet, which was more than just a challenge. As he stood, Kronock took off full sprint and kicked Roketh upside the head. The Dragon toppled from the attack, and somersaulted out of his crater. Roketh did manage a dazed Cartwheel to his feet, but staggered shortly after. Kronock jumped into the air above Roketh, and spun like a top on his way down. Almost like a version of the Rolling Slash with his left elbow blade. A cut ran adjacent to the one he already had. Roketh backed up a bit off centered. Kronock landed in a crouched position. His right arm pointed behind him, his left went under him, the elbow blade pointing towards the dumbfounded Dragon. <BR> <BR>&#34;I told…you…you can&#39;t…beat me…&#34; Kronock said as he rose slowly, the blade dissipating into thin air. <BR> <BR>&#34;So…&#34; Roketh spoke slowly in return, &#34;You&#39;ve lost your power, eh?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Fool…&#34; Kronock muttered as his fingers eagerly formed fists, &#34;I need not…foolish technology…to beat…anyone…&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, both of Kronock&#39;s hands exploded. In their place, three tentacles on each hand like his first child. Two were five feet in length, the last was seven. Roketh was a bit shocked again. Kronock was more like a Jell than any other monster. The tendrils slapped the ground, anxiously awaiting a warm coat of blood. <BR> <BR>Roketh felt two sensations now. One on his upper left shoulder, the other on his lower right back. He glanced over each shoulder to see Moonshadow and Galin standing there, a paw and a heavy hand on him. <BR> <BR>&#34;This is the best way we can help you, old friend.&#34; Moonshadow spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;Win this one for us.&#34; Galin said slowly. <BR> <BR>Instantly, Roketh felt a slight pain in his back. They where giving him their very life force. Roketh felt mad that he had to resort to this, but he couldn&#39;t beat Kronock inn his current state. Moonshadow&#39;s form fell limply to the side. Galin&#39;s body fell to its knees, leaning against Roketh&#39;s back, before sliding around it to the hard earth. Roketh held his eyes shut as he grasped his scythe once more, determined more than ever to win. <BR> <BR>-Can Roketh beat such a powerful foe now? All of his friends and allies have sacrificed themselves for this moment, so Roketh could defeat him. Now, can Roketh live up to the task? Can he muster the strength? Why don&#39;t I end it now? Because I want more chapters than Black Razor? Maybe, or I just ran out of time again…you decide- <BR> <BR>CHB Stay Tuned.
