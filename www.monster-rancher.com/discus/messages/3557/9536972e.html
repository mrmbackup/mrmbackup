 Angel, Zan, and secrets of the Lost. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I think back on it...  Ah no no no...  Horrible beginning...&#34;  I mumble to myself as I dip my quill in its inkwell and put a neat line through the offending text.  From the corner of the small cabin I hear a single noise. <BR> <BR>-Chirp.- <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh quiet you...  You can&#39;t hold a quill let alone think up a decent beginning to this can you?&#34;  I reply, with silence my only answer.  With Zan, it is almost always my answer.  To be expected I guess, all things considered. <BR> <BR>Oh yeah, Zan.  I could start there I guess.  But, it would make more sense to start before that, back on the ranch of my father, and Angel. <BR> <BR>I wrote. <BR> <BR>It all started about six years ago, on my father&#39;s ranch.  It was a small ranch not very popular, and lacking even an assistant like most ranchers had when they became &#39;official&#39; in the eyes of the various arena circles.  We were official, more or less.  But the last monster we had entered was about two years before this, and had been killed by a lucky blow from one of the much rarer &#39;mixed&#39; monsters.  A &#39;marble&#39; if I recall...  Golem and naga?  Not important really. <BR> <BR>After that, my father sort of retired from the arena, letting his assistant go attend other tasks.  We were lucky, as the assistant had put in a good word for us at the local shrine, and we were still able to regenerate monsters from the sacred disks we had scrounged up over the years.  We used them sparingly when we were official.  Now, we used them with even more frugality. <BR> <BR>My father was married at one point, but his wife, my mother, died about ten years ago, around my tenth birthday.  I miss her dearly, but who wouldn&#39;t.  Maybe that&#39;s why my father&#39;s last monster died as it did.  Not something I dwell on, I really liked Rover. <BR> <BR>Another denizen of the old ranch, was Angel.  Of the old mixed breed monsters as well, she was on the ranch for as long as I could remember.  I&#39;m not sure when my father had acquired her, but she had a very long life span. <BR> <BR>I wipe away a tear, dipping my quill again. <BR> <BR>Until yesterday actually.  My father had told me, that if she ever lifted her hand in anger, to fight, she would die.  She had lived all of my eighteen odd years, and whatever time while I was not there, I believed him.  For she died protecting me and Zan. <BR> <BR>But, that doesn&#39;t explain everything, does it? <BR> <BR>After my father retired he started to teach me.  Now, he had a lot of experience, training many kinds of monsters.  And not all of them even remotely mild tempered.  One, he called &#39;Cypher&#39; was a dragon.  Large, foul tempered and even worse at feeding time.  He was my first test.  &#39;Train him, and any monster you raise, will follow you into the abyss itself.&#39;  He would say.  He was right too.  After I had tried kindness, begging, pleading, a lot of running away with my clothes on fire, I finally resorted to rolling up my sleeve and grabbing my base ball bat. <BR> <BR>I remember very little after I had said &#39;All right you dragon!&#39;  I had come out of that with a broken arm, a charred stump of baseball bat, and a dragon that respected me.  I guess it gave me points for effort.  But after that, the &#39;try and get a hand as well as food&#39; stopped.  The &#39;set the rancher on fire&#39; stopped, and even the &#39;I don&#39;t want to train today&#39; stopped. <BR> <BR>Well for the most part.  But at least, by the time my arm healed, I was able to &#39;suggest&#39; &#40;I could never just up and order Cypher to do something,&#41; just about anything.  My father, impressed, patted me on the head, and gave Cypher a nod. <BR> <BR>I knew right then, my dad had set me up.  It took me a broken arm to learn this lesson, but looking back on it, it wasn&#39;t so bad.  Another lesson was soon to come after that.  For Cypher died less than three months later.  &#39;Compared to us, they live very short lives.  Most of them, at least.&#39; <BR> <BR>This was said with a fond look to Angel, ever present as a comforting person.  I hugged her as I watched Cypher breath his last. <BR> <BR>After my fifteenth birthday, something changed among the people of the town.  Rumors started to surface about, of all things, Angel.  &#39;Not natural.&#39;  &#39;Some sort of secret.&#39;  &#39;Evil magic.&#39;  I was worried, and so was my father.  Angel seemed sad over the whole affair, and I knew she and my father expected this.  It angered me, that my best friend was being accused of this.  I wanted to fight back against the villagers, to tell them Angel was just a monster.  But my father told me no, and to take her with me, and leave.  &#39;That wretched assistant.  The secret must have been too much for him.  I expect torches and pitchforks on this one son.  Please, head to the camping spot north of here, and wait for a few days.  Angel, please, take the discs and protect my son.&#39; <BR> <BR>A single nod from Angel, and things started happening too fast, my mind raced to keep up with my body.  Pick up bag.  Food, need that.  The tiger growls outside.  I hear voices, angry, demanding.  A hand on my shoulder and a tug out the back door.  Hands are full, hard to keep up with the pure white fur in front of me.  Crashing through the forest.  Again the tiger growls, then yelps.  I fall. <BR> <BR>Blackness.  My mind finally caught up with my body then.  &#39;Watch where you are going son, you fall less.&#39;  I could hear my father say. <BR> <BR>----------- <BR> <BR>Comments!  Please!  ^_^ <BR> <BR>Oh yeah.  Huzzah!  My first post. &#40;Thanks again Lisa&#41;
