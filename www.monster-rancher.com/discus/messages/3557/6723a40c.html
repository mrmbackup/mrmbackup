 Rain was falling heavily from the sky and splashing up with brown, wet mud as the two blue legs trampled through the ground.  They hit the ground one after the other propelling their owner through the windy air.  The owner was Tarn.  Behind him he could hear howling, the tigers were on to him.  They had already caught the other three.  Lefty, Cleo and Yell had all been ripped to shreds by the tigers.  A day ago they had been small time thieves.  At the time the four of them had hated it, so they went for the big score.  It was like an abandoned castle with people living there.  It was like an abandoned castle due to its boarded up windows and chipped stonework.  There were people there though and who ever they were they would have to be rich enough to afford the house in the first place.  Only one person had ever seen the owners of the house before, he had driven a meat cart through the huge stone doors and been introduced to the Duchess herself.  When the gang had heard about this they were even more eager to do it.  So they had gone up the windy, mud path to the castle gates.  They had always been a gang, since kids, they were rough.  Four of them, always four, they did the stuff as four or did nothing at all.   <BR> <BR>Lefty was an eared mew, he had a ripped left ear though he had lost in a fight with a naga.     Cleo was a mum mew, she was the only female and a lot smarter than the guys, she was a lot quicker as well but not quite as strong. Yell was a main breed mew and had a special link with Tarn, he was the leader in a way but always to fast to jump into things, it had been him who had set the alarms off. <BR> <BR> Tarn could still hear the tigers behind him; they had been automatically released when Yell had touched the wire. Hundreds of them, longhaired mountainous tigers. Had leapt from a hidden door and grabbed Yell right off.  The golden candlestick he had been holding fell to the ground as he was grasped in the jaws of a blue and white mouth.  Tarn and the other two had run then but Lefty had ran off from the other two and they had heard his cry as he ran to a dead end.  Cleo had been cut off purely by chance.  A tiger had run ahead of the group and totally missed Tarn.  He sent Cleo flying forwards as he slammed into her and she landed badly.  She was swept up by the bright white teeth and killed on the spot.  Tarn had been running for a long time and was running back towards the town.  Suddenly there was a flash of blue and a tiger leapt from the bushes.  It roared and Tarn skidded to a stop.  It looked down its nose at the creature.  Tarn jumped into the air as his jaws snapped below him.  He fell into the deep sticky mud and his blue fur was matted into deep thick knots.  The tiger was ready to bite again.  Its horns drove into the ground as Tarn dodged wildly and randomly.  The tiger was strong and had been well trained in skill but Tarn was a little to fast, for the moment.  He would soon get tired and make a mistake then he would fall just as Yell, Cleo and Lefty had.  The only way was to fight the tiger.  Its teeth were coated in blood of other victims and its chin was dripping with rain.  Tarn leapt up one foot forward and kicked the tiger in the snout.  It back up a little, its eyes were watering, not tears but dripping as the tiger tried desperately to sneeze.  He knew that if he sneezed at a bad time then Tarn would have an easy chance to attack.  The tiger scratched his nose lightly while Tarn waited.  The tiger&#39;s horns lit up with electricity and blasted a powerful bolt towards Tarn.  It hit him and pain ran through his body as the rain magnified the thunders power.  He leapt up again this time smashing into the tigers back with a powerful slamming attack.  The tiger sneezed and Tarn ran in, fists flying.  Punches were landed in all areas of the dogs face.  The tiger tried to react but could not open his eyes due to primal instincts.  He cowered back as hit after hit poured into his snout, face and mouth. The creature charged a thunder attack and Tarn leapt back.  The electricity hit the ground just in front of the creature and electricity ran through the giant puddles.  The tiger howled in agony and jerked uncontrollably, His fur burnt, blood ran from his eyes and mouth.  His skin slowly burnt into nothingness until pile of black muscles lay in a puddle of blood.  Tarn smiled slightly but knew that there were more tigers on their way.  He looked to the left and saw a wall of fauna.  The woodland lay between the castle and the nearest town, it was a long route but could be made and was a lot easier to hide in than the open road.  Tarn disappeared into the greenery and ran in the direction of the village.  He stopped only when he could no longer hear the howling and lay on a pile of fallen leaves, it was no longer raining as hard and the trees were forming a roof above him.  He slowly fell into a sleep.  He awoke to find daylight.  He made his way for the village but was amazed by the site that met him.  Blue lights, everywhere.  The whole town was full of police, wagons with blue tinted candles. They were placing photos up, wanted posters with Tarn&#39;s face on them.  Wanted for murder and theft.  Tarn was shocked; he had been caught before and never had a response like this.  It just showed how the police were influenced by money.  He slipped through the outer streets to his favorite bar.  It treated monsters, mostly strays but sometimes trained monsters.  It was a totally human free zone.  The bar keeper and owner of the estate was Garth, a murdering draco moochi, he lost one of his eyes in a fight with a centaur and permanently wore an eye patch.  He slipped in and ordered a drink.  Garth was in great awe of him as soon as he got him his drink he began to tell others of Tarns great thief.  Tarn told of how Lefty, Cleo and Yell had been killed and the whole bar fell into silent respect.  There was a crash and the door fell in, a dozen armed guards ran in holding their guns facing the bar.   <BR> <BR>&#34;No body move or we will fire, we no you are in here Tarn and another noted criminal Garth!&#34; <BR> <BR>A loud shout arose from one of the police.  Tarn looked desperately to Garth who looked back with equal despair.  Then he grabbed Tarns arm and they ran.  Tarn was in shock at first but then he realized the situation and his legs kicked in.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Stop!&#34; The police man screamed. <BR> <BR>Garth dragged Tarn through a broken window to the sound of gunshots and a hail of bullets.  They fell for what felt a long time.  Tarn had no idea what would happen when they met the floor but they never did.  A trampoline had been placed at the bottom, of the fall.  They had some how got to the bottom of Kia mountain.  The mountain held the whole town above and at the castle could just be seen at the top of the hill. <BR> <BR>&#34;When can we go back there?&#34; Tarn said as Garth walked forward quietly.  He was walking away from the hill leading to the village.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Never.  That castle had money, the police will stay guarding the area for ever if they have to.&#34; <BR> <BR>The two walked on, their futures were unknown to them, but not everyone.  They were now outcasts.
