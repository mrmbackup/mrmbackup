 &#40;&#40;This isn&#39;t monster rancher related but it&#39;s a part of a fantasy story I&#39;m workin on. If you guys like it I&#39;ll post more.&#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>Of Mystic&#39;s and Weavers <BR> <BR>Act 1:Chosen		     <BR> <BR>Prologue:The Rain <BR> <BR>He was the last to leave the funeral, still staring down at the freshly dug mound of earth long after friends and family members had gone. Benjamin Wynn had buried his best friend today, and no doubt a piece of himself. The forest that surrounded him had gone silent, save for the steady beat of rain drops as they pelted everything from above. Yes, it was raining again...as it did so often these last few weeks. It seemed every other day the sky would darken, thick storm clouds swelled with moisture gathering to unleash their fury upon the earth below. The rains would come and lakes and rivers overflowed, spilling out onto the land, drowning crops and plants and whatever couldn&#39;t make it to higher ground. The sound of rainfall suffocated everything else, no birds sang, no crickets chirped. It devoured everything else in the forest. Today it seemed especially fitting. <BR> <BR>The funeral had been very brief, a few kind words spoken, a few prayers sung, and then the coffin descended. The oak coffin was simple, yet lovingly designed, an attractive piece of work. Little time was afforded to mourning before the rains came again. Horrible timing, but the other villagers could not remain. With the rain and clouds came darkness...and with the darkness came the enemy. Benjamin had not been able to speak the words in his heart at the funeral as planned, so he remained behind and spoke them in private. And here he remained, eyes downcast, hands folded before him. It was the least he could do... <BR> <BR>Consumed with grief, it took the young man a moment to realize the danger he was in by remaining behind. His clothes and hair were soaked from the rain when he finally lifted his gaze to scan the forest around him. Levia forest seemed to go on forever. Huge trees with gnarled, moss covered trunks and shimmering emerald leaves trees dominated the landscape. It was midsummer, and by now their full branches all but blocked out the sun except for small rays of light here and there. The air was warm and humid, even worse after rainfall. It was also a place of shadows. They draped over every tree and stone and seemed to hold a will of their own at times. Occasionally Benjamin would spot them move out of the corner of his eye. He&#39;d noticed it since he was a child. The other villagers saw it too, he was sure, but dismissed it as a trick of light or their eyes playing tricks. <BR> <BR>A dirt path about twenty yards from where he stood connected to a trail that ascended to the mountain village he called home. Home...he thought of it and decided it was time to return. Benjamin gave his respects and turned on his heel toward the path. The ground was flat here, save for the tripping hazards created by uplifted tree roots. His boots left deep imprints along the path, now slick and covered with mud from the rains. Countless times he walked this road during his seventeen years of life. Nowhere did he feel as comfortable, strolling beneath the protective canopy, the trees like huge wooden sentinels. His best memories had been right here...and his mind began to wander. But it was no sugary memory of childhood...it was more recent...and far more horrific.  <BR> <BR>It was two days ago, the bright rays of morning quickly shrouded by gray clouds and gloom. A cold wind swept through the village, and Ben could still recall the generally uneasiness that seemed to effect everyone whom lived their. That morning was uneventful until word got out that the daughter of the town magistrate had been lost in the forests below. Benjamin knew her, a little six year old girl named Elixis. She was a spoiled brat. At once a small party was formed to travel down the mountain path and search for her. Anyone else would have been left in that forest to rot...but this was the magistrates daughter after all. Benjamin and his friend Zavier were two of the five &#39;volunteered&#39; to look for her. Zavier was a year older then him, a big guy, stocky with a pleasant face and unruly blond hair. At first glance you&#39;d think him one of the guard, and while skilled in combat it was purely for self defense. He was a kind and passive person...sometimes too passive. Together with three other men from the village they walked the winding path that led to Levia forest below. None would be prepared for what they found at the bottom... <BR> <BR>Benjamin stopped for a moment along the path, breaking away from his memories of the past for a second. Something had darted passed the corner of his vision. It was small and black, that much he was certain of. Turning, he searched for it warily, looking beyond the tall grass that surrounded him and to the guardian trees. Covered in moss and shadow he looked at them imploringly, as if they would bare the forests secrets to him. The leaves above rustled violently in the wind, showering Benjamin with more icy droplets. The trees revealed nothing, he had to move on... <BR> <BR>The weather reminded him of two evenings ago. They had descended into the forest and found a peculiar feeling waiting for them. Benjamin remembered it well, an oppressive heaviness. The air was thick, so humid you could choke on it. He felt a terrible weight on his shoulders, his eyes began to sting, his mouth went dry. Then he heard the voices, whispering into his ear, always just beyond hearing the words they spoke. They sounded threatening, they sounded angry. Ben felt as if their presence was not tolerated, as if the forest itself wanted them gone. They dealt with the terrible feeling and fanned out to search for the little girl. It was then Benjamin first noticed something was wrong with Zavier. He was distant, distracted, even abit confused. Ben watched him walk toward a cluster of trees and disappear within them as they to, split up. It was another fifteen minutes of fruitless searching before Benjamin heard the first scream ring out, shattering the ominous silence of the forest. <BR> <BR>There is was again! Benjamin whirled about this time, breaking his train of thought, desperate to find out what was following him. The shadow in the corner of his eye seemed much larger this time. He looked again and found nothing, save for the sting of rain water in his eye. A feint mist was rising up from the ground, coating the forest floor with a thick, damp blanket of ghostly white. The moisture clung to his skin and clothing. If he didn&#39;t get home soon he&#39;d get sick for certain. Taking one last glance behind him Ben started toward the village again. He had reached the mountain path by now, a long cobblestone road. Mount Destiny itself stood before him. It seemed to Benjamin that it&#39;s wind swept peaks had been around since time began. The mountain would always be hear, he knew, a solid immutable presence. The ground began to rise sharply and his paced quickened regardless, his thoughts traveling back to that day... <BR> <BR>Two nights ago, that scream... He ran towards it recklessly, his sword drawn. He found one of his comrades, one of the older men. His gut was slashed open, his body mangled in ways that made the young mans stomach turn. He called out to the others, no one came. Benjamin searched them out...and he found them indeed, butchered and broken. Bones shattered and muscles torn by what looked like claws. No human being had done this. He had not found Zavier, and panic gripped him at the thought of what he would find... <BR> <BR>Benjamin&#39;s memories were halted yet again. Something was behind him, watching him. He could see little from the corner of his eye, only a black form, roughly humanoid. He feared turning around, but if he didn&#39;t face this &#39;thing&#39; he might get attacked from behind. Ben whirled about very suddenly, and found nothing. The wind was blowing the mist on the forest floor around, the trees still hide their secrets. Was he going crazy? He wasn&#39;t sure.. Continuing up the path again he walked the long, curved path along the mountains side, traveling higher still... <BR> <BR>Ever since that day, he&#39;d been abit unhinged. He found Zavier all right. His friend was hunched over, his back turned to Benjamin. He was trembling violently, almost convulsing. When approached he began to weep. Benjamin placed a hand on his shoulder, told him they had to escape. He barely had enough time to move when Zavier suddenly twirled around and slashed at him with his blade! His friend stood erect, a twisted grin in his face, a mad look in his eyes. Benjamin saw the blood stains on him, dripping from his hands, his sword...his lips. Zavier cocked his head to the side abit, regarding him before exclaiming... ~You are the one?~ <BR> <BR>Benjamin had no idea what he meant, his legs frozen with fear and horrified disbelief. Zavier charged at him like a rabid bear and swung his blade without further comment. Ben suffered a slash across the chest, not too serious a wound for he had fainted back abit. He hesitated to strike back, he tried to reason and failed, he pleaded but was given no heed. Finally, when a violent swing from Zavier was aimed to cut off his head he ducked beneath it... Zavier had overextended himself that time, he&#39;d left himself open to counterattack. This time.... Benjamin did not hesitate... <BR> <BR>Finally he reached home, shoving the memories to the back of his mind. The village was built within the mountain itself. It was a fortress actually, protected by stone that had withstood countless ages. The guards watching the gates recognized him at once and opened the way for him. Massive stone doors slowly parted, no longer barring the path. None of the villagers really knew what happened that day... <BR> <BR>And they would never know...

 Ohhh, nice one. I like the fact this site does have a section of non-MR related stoires like this. MR stories have a good audience, but people are more prone to read something like this if they have never heard of Monster Rancher. <BR> <BR>Very nice, when I&#39;m famous, I might just get some of these published. For their respected arthurs, of course.

 Thanks alot. ;&#41; And I agree this section is a good idea. Although it&#39;d be nicer if more people wrote stories this HAS to be the best fiction section in ANY monster rancher site. And I&#39;m not saying that cause some of it&#39;s mine. You could delete everything I posted here and it&#39;d still be the best MR fiction section on the net.
