 Well, library seems kinda dead... &#42;Shakes head&#42; Anyways =D <BR> <BR>This is a fiction I&#39;m working on currently, I also have it posted at another site, but... I dun wanna advertise or anything =&#92; &#40;If you dunno who I am, you probably don&#39;t wanna go to the site ^^;; &#41; <BR>Anyways... This is a dark fiction, a little bit of Silent Hill basises, with a stolen character off of something else... <BR> <BR>Beh, Vashy boring you, if you&#39;re even reading this V_V Onto Clockwork... <BR> <BR>Clockwork Little Happiness~ Chapter One <BR> <BR>	Darkness... Everywhere... <BR>	It is engulfing him, making it had to breath... Where is he? The air is so thick... His head hurts. The sound of machinery is heard somewhere, of clanking steel and metallic sounding moans. <BR>	Eyes growing adjusted to the light, the young man turns around in a circle, seeing outlines of a narrow wall on two sides of him, and nothing but darkness, seeming to stretch on forever, on the other two sides. The walls... Something is wrong with the walls, they look stra-- Gah! His head... Hard to breath. The walls seem to be closing in on him, and he can see them better. A rusty, bloody color... Or is it just color? The walls seem to be alive, like writhing and squirming maggots, the naseating mixture of rust and bloody splattered everywhere. <BR>	Suddenly, he is running into the endless darkness of the apparent tunnel, primal fear pushing him forward, past the writhing walls inches from him. <BR>	He sees something in the distance-- a door, perhaps? He gains a spark of hope, rejoicing already from his find, knowing that there is a way out of this hellhole. He smiles, but the smile quickly fades as he feels the writing wall brush his shoulders. The walls really are closing in, it isn&#39;t just his imagination. <BR>	He turns sideways as he feels the space beginning to get more cramped, shuddering from the feel of whatever the &#39;wall&#39; is made of as it rubs against his shoulders. He slides, sideways, down the hall towards the door, which has a space of nothingness in front of it. If he can just make it a few more feet, he will--	No! He can feel the wall brushing against his back and chest, and gasps as claustrophobia sets in. He remembers now, how he fears small spaces... <BR>	Panicking, he lunges towards the open area, but seems to be held back by the wall, the writhing sections of it seeming to pull him towards them. His hope dwindles, despair and fear setting in, as he realizes he can&#39;t move. Something loud sounds in the distance, growing nearer to him... Sirens... <BR> <BR>	Screaming, the young man sits upright in bed, sweating despite the chilly air coming through the open window of his apartment. His sheets are strewn about carelessly, none of it actually doing its job in covering him. Breathing heavily, he sits there, eyes wide... <BR>	&#34;What was that...? Some kind of dream?&#34; <BR>	Shaking his head, the youth swings his legs off the side of the bed, his feet making contact with the floor with a light thud. He stands, the loose khakis he wore to bed-- which he is glad of, now, due to the chill in the air-- ruffling against the bed&#39;s side. He flings his raven black hair, a considerable long length, just above the halfway mark of his back, behind his shoulder. Eyes closed, he catches a faint image of the tunnel-- or whatever it was-- he was in moments earlier. No, he wasn&#39;t there... Just a dream. <BR>	He walks over to his window, and snaps into reality, hearing sirens near his apartment complex. Is that what woke him up? <BR>	&#34;Thanks, whoever they&#39;ve come after.&#34; He murmers, shutting the window back, unsure of how it got open in the first place. He knew it would be cold, and he left the windows shut before he went to bed. He was sure of it... <BR>	Chuckling a little, he stands in the dark. What was it... &#39;Sirens always come for someone, like a messenger from some higher entity, to take you away from the pain.&#39; ...Yeah, that was it... An old saying he knew, but did not know of who first said it... <BR>	He flicks his desk lamp on, staring at his bed. No way he was going back to sleep, now... the things that you saw in the movies, of people having horrid dreams and just turning over going back to sleep, is about as true as most other stuff you see in them. Dreams like that, or just bad dreams in general, make you not want to sleep. <BR>	And sleep he will surely not. Fear of whatever that place was will keep him up until the next night, where, forgetting about the dream, he would fall asleep once more. <BR>	That&#39;s how it has been for the past week... A strange dream followed by a night of restlessness, only to go to sleep the next night, and repeat the process... It started the day he got the letter... <BR>	Walking over to his desk, he picks up a small envelope, pulling out a neatly folded piece of paper. An invitation, actually, from someone who&#39;s name he did not know, to a place he had never been... <BR>	He had dismissed it as nothing but junk mail, the first glance he took of it. But it plagued his mind, curiosity abounding. Who was this person? Apparently female, by the name of Kira, but not one he had ever heard of, none the less. <BR>	It had been adressed to him, but the name used was Vash. That was what attained his almost immediate interest, after he had thought about it. <BR>	Only people he knew called him that... Any telemarketer or person wanting nothing more than his money would have used his real name. This Kira... She must know him. But why does he not know her? <BR>	He stares at the return adress, which is the same as where he was being summoned to. It sounds like a name of a hotel... <BR>	A new light flashes in the room as he turns on his computer. A light blue flash, gone in an instant, replaced by the rich colored light from the background of his computer. He hums as he waits for the internet to connect, still remembering the dream, though not frightened now. <BR>	&#34;Hm... Let&#39;s see, here...&#34; He types in the name of the hotel, or what he believes to be the name of it, into a search engine. A few results pop up, and he smiles to himself as he finds what he was looking for. It is the name of a hotel... One along the north-eastern coast of the united states. <BR>	&#34;New England, huh?&#34; <BR>	Muttering, he closes the envelope back up, reclining back in his desk chair. The curiosity is almost too much... Maybe he should go. What could be the harm? <BR>His light green eyes reflect the blue-green colors of his desktop background, on his computer, making them seem a very light hazel color. He grins, and looks back down at the envelope. <BR>	&#34;...Why not. I haven&#39;t had any good seafood since I moved into this stupid apartment.&#34; <BR>He stands up, and begins to search for his suitcase, his tired and weary mind glad to have something to occupy it from the strange dream of moments before. <BR>	Darting around his shabbily decorated room, full of hanging pictures and bookcases, which are also filled with books, the place hadn&#39;t been through much of a change since he had first moved in. Still the brown walls, and darkly toned colors of the past tenant&#39;s own liking decorate the room. He didn&#39;t care what the colors were... Just somewhere to sleep when he was busy. Albeit, he had done very little of that, as of late. <BR>	He finishes packing some clothes, grabbing a few books and chucking them haphazardly into the suitcase. A quick phone call seals the decision, and he grabs his car keys, exiting the tiny, one room, one bathroom apartment. Whatever is going on, he is going to find out, he promises himself, as he ducks into the drivers side of his car...
