 Some time after Gonzalaz came to life from the tree Colt planted, we receved a letter in the mail, saying there was an erranrty discount. &#34;Well, he could do with some new attacks...&#34; I said. So we took Gonzalaz to the Mandy dessert errantry. He came back from the errantry a month later, and we were told that he had defeated a wild monster. When we got back to the ranch, Gonzalaz handed something to Colt. &#34;What&#39;s this?&#34; she asked. &#34;Looks like a spear,&#34; i said. &#34;I think doctor Talico should have a look at it,&#34; she replied. Colt went inside and called Dr. Talico. &#34;He&#39;ll be here soon,&#34; she said. Then all of a sudden, Joy let out an alamed squack, and Gonzalaz growled. &#34;What&#39;s wrong you two?&#34; asked Colt. &#34;I have the strange feeling we&#39;re being watched,&#34; i said. All of a sudden Gonzalaz ran off, &#34;Where&#39;s he going?&#34; asked Colt as we ran after him. Gonzalaz ran over the top of the hill, and when we arrived there, we saw him locked in combat with the stangest monster we had ever seen. It had the lower body of a horse, middle body like a man, and a birdlike head. After a cose battle, Gonzalaz managed to chase the creature away. When we got back to the ranch, Dr. Talico was waiting. &#34;What happened here, why do you look so angry?&#34; he asked. Colt and i told him the whole story, how Gonzalaz had found the spear, all the way to the battle with the strange creature. &#34;Lower body of horse, and a birdlike head? Sounds like a centaur, i did not know that they lived around here, though.&#34; he said. &#34;Centaur? I think i read about them in an old school book.&#34; said Colt. &#34;Hey, do you think we could use this spear as a seasoning in combining monsters?&#34; I asked. &#34;Maybe you could aske Dadge,&#34; said Dr. Talico. &#34;We will,&#34; said Colt. &#34;Well, I must be on my way,&#34; said Talico.  <BR> <BR>Well, the centaur had done some heavy damage to Gonzalaz, and sadly, he died the next week. We took the spear to the lab and used as a seasoning and got a centaur of our own, which we named Chester. He&#39;s doing good, who knows? Maybe our ranch will take another intresting twist. We&#39;ll see! <BR> <BR>THE END!
