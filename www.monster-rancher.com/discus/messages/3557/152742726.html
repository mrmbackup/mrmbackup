 Cecil had just returned from the IMa offical D with Kasumi, a Pixie. Colt gave him a congratulations hug. 4 weeks later he and Colt had a visitor. Her name was Claire&#40;you might recognize her from Monster Rancher DS2.&#41; She looked about 14-16, blonde hair, two ponytails, blue eyes, a red open shirt, blue shorts, and red boots with laces. She was flirting with him, which made Colt mad. Eventually she takes them both to her area, which was called BOMBA. She said it stood for Bogon Monster Breeders Association. When she took them to her ranch, she said there are some monsters you can only get here. Cecil saw a monster with a staff.He asked &#34;Who is this.&#34; Claire said that was an Abyss. She then shows Colt and Cecil a hot spring, which Claire and Colt get in their swimsuits, which look like get this a turquoise two piecer for Colt and a red two piecer for Claire, and get in. They both ask Cecil to get in his and get in, which he initially refuses, but not after Claire flirts with him by saying she and Colt will give him  LOT of kisses, which afterwards he gets in. Cecil sees a girl named Crysta, who he recognizes as a person he read about in breeder&#39;s school. She, too flirts with him. Twenty years later, Cecil and Claire are married and have a kid named after Holly. <BR> <BR> <BR>comments are welcome
