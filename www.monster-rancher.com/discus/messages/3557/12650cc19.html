 You can&#39;t actually force people to comment here. Poetry isn&#39;t my strong point, so I&#39;ll remain silent.

 I&#39;m not really into non rhyming poetry unless it has strong imagery or symbolism in it, free verse has always seemed, IMHO, to be a form of essay writing when done badly.   <BR> <BR>Why use that repeating word scheme? Its gimmicky and its inconsistently applied throughout the piece. The black zan splattered with blood running down the road is also repeated, rather needlessly i think, since the reader already knows that and then you repeat it again, why? It just adds length without strengthening the image or the emotion you&#39;re trying to evoke. Also I think its a bit long, and you could probably tighten it up by excising some unecessary words.   <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if that helps. Just my two cents.
