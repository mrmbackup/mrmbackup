 The morning of the second day of battle had arrived. Dew settled on the field of battle and the monster gotted prepared for their upcoming battles.  <BR> <BR>The crowds had packed into the stadium once more the watch the greatest fighters of all time compete in one last battle.  <BR> <BR>Zeke and Stellar had both stepped onto the battle field to fight. A fight that they both were used to. They had known each other for awhile and Stellar had never managed a victory over the darkness of the Zan. Stellar walked up the stair a glare was on the floor of the battle field. Stellar squinted his eyes as the sun had loomed over the stadium. The roar of the crowd had picked up from when it was. Zeke had won the 4 meetings between these 2 in 13 seconds and under. Stellar had a lump in his throat and was nervous approaching the center.  <BR> <BR>Zeke flipped up onto the the stadium floor and had complete confidence in his self. He stared at Stellar, a face he had known all too well. He had seen Stellar many occasions and he wasn&#39;t much of a challenge. Stellar gulp with uncertainty as the match was underway. Stellar close his eyes and prayed for guidence.. For hope that he could conquer this giant that had defeated him many times before. The stadium began furiously circling him. It was just a whirl in his eyes. It was sickening to Stellar he couldn&#39;t believe the feeling he had after his losses. He wanted to win this. The cocky grin of Zeke.. He had seen it too many times.. He had never seen it defeated.. It had only been challenged once. He hated it. He wanted to rip his face off. Foam fell out of the raging dogs mouth as he angstly await the match to start.. Which seemed like an eternity.  <BR> <BR>&#34;They say when you die, life goes in slow motion and you see everything you&#39;ve done flash before your eyes&#34; Stellar thought in his head.. As images of him as a puppy to growing up and receiving a gold medal in his last world championships.  <BR> <BR>&#34;No.&#34; The soft word fell from his mouth as he hit the ground. He laid on his side. A gaping wound in his side. Zeke was a hellish blur of black as he passed by. The black monster licked the blood off his claw as he walked off the ring. Stellar closed his eyes. &#34;Is this it?! Is this all I have left?!&#34; The questions raged through his head as he sat up. He barked over to Zeke who was walking away.  <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s not over! I must beat you!&#34; Stellar hollered. Zeke turned his head. Blood seeped out of Stellar&#39;s wound as he tried to stand up. &#34;You poor mutt. You don&#39;t know when it&#39;s over&#34; With another furious flash of black Stellar had now been scarred. Not on his body. His ego, his pride, his honor had been shot. Blood gushed out of a wound ontop of his head. It leaked down to the floor. Stellar stood up once more.  <BR> <BR>&#34;You fool.&#34; Zeke whispered as he walked slowly at Stellar who gave one last futile charge at the demon. He bit Zeke on the arm and clamped tightly, Zeke flexed his muscles in his arm and it shattered the dogs teeth that were embedded in his arm. Stellar fell down and laid motionless. No special comeback, no heroic move, nothing fancy. He laid there, the match was over and Stellar was carted off. Zeke would be going to the finals. <BR> <BR>Ruth and Elizkee walked onto the stage. Neither showed any emotion or worry. The match started Ruth pelted the Durahan&#39;s dragon-like armor. Ruth was smashing him with unrelenting blows. The metallica fist of Ruth continued to hit Elizkee, with no effect. Ruth then assumed a form that was oddly similar to that of a spaceship. She flew with great speed at the knight. Elizkee caught Ruth and threw her like a frisbee into the crowd and with an explosion the stair were taken out, no human casualities.  <BR> <BR>Ruth begun to spin faster and came around harder. Elizkee jumped up as the metal monster came flying towards him and as soon as she crept closer Elizkee thrusted his sword right through the middle of the Metalner. Oil spewed out of the top and the monster was stuck in its spaceship form. Elizkee shucked ruth off his sword and another casuality had occured at the hand of the evil hands of Elizkee. Electrical waves pulsated through the body of Ruth as she softly spoke.  <BR> <BR>&#34;You may of won the war.. but i&#39;m going to take you down with me!&#34; With that Ruth self-destructed Elizkee was caught off-guard and the pile of armor had been caught in the explosion. After the dust had subsided Elizkee appeared, kneeled over. Dust and scratched covered him as he fell over. His sword had impaled his right arm and he needed some surgery. Luckily he was still alive and was capabel to walk off the stage and take the victory. <BR> <BR>&#34;The consolations will begin tommorrow!&#34; Announced the announcer, &#34;And the Championship will be next weekend!&#34; Fans moaned after hearing they would have to wait a whole week for the final match. Thankfully they had the consolations to keep them entertained.  <BR> <BR>The consolations will be as the following:  <BR>Fleck vs. Bree  <BR>Mo Mo vs. Vox &#40;deceased&#41;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Mo Mo will fight Stellar.Vox will take 8th as he died first and 7th will be going to Ruth as she died as well.&#34;The overspeaker blaired this in many different languages as the fans packed into the sovineir stands and some went off to their hotels for the day. <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, in the monsters room.. Stellar had made a full recovery and Elizkee payed a visit to Zeke&#39;s room.  <BR> <BR>&#34;You, yes you. Zan. I will kill you in the finals. I promise.&#34; Elizkee gloated.  <BR>&#34;Hmph! You&#39;re a wicked monster and you don&#39;t deserve to live!&#34; Zeke said sitting up as he glared angrily at Elizkee.  <BR>&#34;Our match will be to the death. No mercy.&#34; Elizkee said as he walked away from Zeke&#39;s room. Zeke laid back in his chain and went back to watching televison.  <BR> <BR>This is the last chapter I will be writing until Friday. I hope i&#39;m getting better, your imput is welcome.

 GAAAAH!!!!I couldn&#39;t read it for content with the mistakes in it! please have a sib, parent, SO, or somebody you trust read over it first. Using spell check only drops misspelled words, and verb tenses are not misspelled, just bad grammar. Look for that, have an editor look for them, some people even have two&#40;editors&#41;. Please, look before you post. that is all. PS. Please don&#39;t disregard the other post&#39;s critiques, as I still see some in there.
