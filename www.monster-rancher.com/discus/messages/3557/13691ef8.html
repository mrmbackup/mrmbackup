 Colt and I went to the shop to buy some items. Colt&#39;s Aunt had some seeds for us. She said some peddaler gave them to her, and they were for her most relable costomers. The next day Colt planted the seed. Over the years, we watched it grow into a beatiful tree. Then, one day we saw blossoms on the tree. They were so beautiful! But, the tree seemed to have moved. To our dismay, in afew days the flowers were gone. The tree looked like it was going to die, so we watered it. A short while after that, the monster we were raising died. We decided not to hold a ceremony, but to pay our respects in private. Me, Colt, and Pabs went to the altar. When we got back, Colt was the first to notice something was strangely amiss. Soon Pabs and I noticed it too. Suddenly we heard a noise coming from the stable. We spun around, and the doors of the stable swung open. Inside, there was some kind of walking tree. &#34;What the heck is that?&#34; screamed Colt. &#34;It&#39;s a Mock! I thought they were extinct!&#34; cried Pabs. &#34;Can we raise it?&#34; I asked. &#34;Hmmm, i guess so.&#34; said pabs,&#34;but it needs a name.&#34; &#34;How bout Gonzalaz?&#34; asked Colt. <BR>&#34;Then Gonzlaz it is then&#34; Pabs and I cried together. That&#39;s basicly what happens when u get a mock.

 I thought it was nicely done. You created an effective informational post while adding some depth to actual gameplay elements. Though I do like the stories, I admit I&#39;m partial to this, and Tony&#39;s writing, because it&#39;s straight out of the game.  You&#39;re fleshing out the bones of events we experience while playing. <BR>If you don&#39;t want to do the others, no big deal. But you do seem to have a good touch at it.
