Creating Session 6: Technology <BR>greenspun.com : LUSENET : Monster Rancher 2 : One Thread  <BR> <BR>Okay, I&#39;m getting desparate for ideas for the topic for these Creating Sessions as you can probably tell. I do these posts for two resons:  <BR>1&#41; It&#39;s cool to see what you people come up with.  <BR>2&#41; If you&#39;re bored, it&#39;s a great way to keep your mind busy and it&#39;s fun too.  <BR>Anyway, make a monster from any man-made item or machine. I can&#39;t come up with any for this one right now.  <BR>To Eagle: No, my pride &#40;chuckle&#41; wasn&#39;t hurt, just my feelings. You&#39;ll see why in a sec.  <BR>To stupid: Why? Why can&#39;t they get along? I love ALL cats. Why do they hate each other? Can&#39;t they just get along? We can make a whole nation of were-felines! Just think! A whole kingdom! Whaddya say? I hate to see two feline species hate each other.  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 04, 2000  <BR>Answers <BR> <BR>Did you ever read that Stephen King short story where the pressing machine in a laundry came alive and started eating people? What about a giant pressing machine with the rollers for a mouth and clanking gears all over. They could suck a monster into their mouth and shoot them out the top nice and crisply pressed.  <BR> <BR>-- Miss Carrie &#40;<A HREF="mailto:musicality1@earthlink.net">musicality1@earthlink.net</A>&#41;, February 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Miss Carrie, from the alias that you use and your &#34;happy&#34; use of an email account, you tend to give the impression of a nice lady. However, your ideas and thoughts tend to contradict this impression. Wasn&#39;t it you that liked raising nagas or jokers? or was that MamaNya? Quite horrid creatures, if you ask me. I haven&#39;t even gotten around to raising them yet.  <BR>It catches us off guard. Well, me at least.  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, February 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I already wrote about an idea for a monster called a Harley in one of the previous creating sessions...  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I am dissapointed that you didnt like my idea of a between the 2 species but if they will be allies wouldnt that be too much they will simply be too powerful combine power &amp; defence with Speed &amp;power they will kick Moo&#39;s dragonbutt and rule the world.Let us create monsters not change or interfere with monster rancher world.  <BR> <BR>-- stupid &#40;<A HREF="mailto:twopacliveson@hotmail.com">twopacliveson@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR>To RNA- I am a nice person and I don&#39;t much like raising nagas and jokers, it must have been MamaNya. Actually I have never raised a joker or a naga, I prefer katos and metalners. As for Stephen King, I really like his writing and think he&#39;s a great author. I don&#39;t read other horror writers unless it&#39;s something out of the ordinary. I prefer fantasy and Science fiction, though I will read almost anything if i am bored.  <BR> <BR>-- Miss Carrie &#40;<A HREF="mailto:musicality1@earthlink.net">musicality1@earthlink.net</A>&#41;, February 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR>What about....  <BR>Vortex &#40;not /sure yet&#41; - A metalic monster, similar to the Henger species. This monster has believed to have been a time traveler due to the unusual numeric design on its lens.  <BR>Lif - 5 Pow - 2 Int - 3 Skill - 3 Speed - 5 Def - 4  <BR>Catatonic Manipulation - The battle timer stops for a few seconds, leaving the opponent temporarily frozen in time.  <BR>Guts cost = 50  <BR>Force = E  <BR>Hit% = S  <BR>Withering = A  <BR>Sharpness = D <BR>  <BR>Temporal Barrier - If the opponent is struck by this technique, its Speed will drop 50% and Hit% will drop 80%. These effects terminate when the battle is finished.  <BR>Guts Cost = 35  <BR>Force = A  <BR>Hit% = B &#40;remeber that it has average skill&#41;  <BR>Withering = C  <BR>Sharpness = E  <BR> <BR>Sonic Disturbence - This technique acts much like Henger&#39;s Sound Wave, but since it is at a higher frequency, it does more damage.  <BR>Guts cost = 25  <BR>Force = C  <BR>Hit% = A  <BR>Withering = B  <BR>Sharpness = S  <BR> <BR>Perilous Pendulum - Vortex alternates sides by appearing behind the opponent, attacking it, then reappearing in its original position.  <BR>Guts cost = 19  <BR>Force = B  <BR>Hit% = S  <BR>Withering = N/A  <BR>Sharpness = E  <BR> <BR>Blur - Vortex travels at the speed of light and displaces its image. The opponent&#39;s chance to hit% is temporarily decreased by 20%.  <BR>Guts cost = 19  <BR>Force = N/A  <BR>Probability = A  <BR> <BR>Light speed - Vortex moves at light speed, and appears behind the opponent. Then, you see a horizontal streak of light penetrate the opponent.  <BR>Guts cost = 45  <BR>Force = S  <BR>Hit% = C  <BR>Withering = D  <BR>Sharpness = S  <BR> <BR>Spinning Hands - Vortex creates a spear-like object, and throws it like a boomerang at the opponent.  <BR>Guts cost = 35  <BR>Force = A  <BR>Hit% = D  <BR>Withering = E  <BR>Sharpness = B  <BR> <BR>Blade Hand - Vortex will turn one of its hands into a sharp blade, and run it through the enemy.  <BR>Guts cost = 15  <BR>Force = D  <BR>Hit% = E  <BR>Withering = C  <BR>Sharpness = S  <BR> <BR>In case you haven&#39;t guessed, Vortex is a clock-like monster. It has great defensive techniques. However, it lacks the power and intelligence to do any major damage. I thought that it was a cool idea. What do you think?  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Dean Koontz is a great writer as well you should try some of his books. Stephen King doesn&#39;t just write horror&#40;gunslinger and green Mile series&#41; He just is extremly imaginative. One of my dreams was to be such a great writer as he is. Alas some things were never meant to be but, Don&#39;t condemn a man before you read his work. Also wasn&#39;t Carrie a title of one of his best-sellers?  <BR> <BR>-- tjmax &#40;<A HREF="mailto:tjmax@tnweb.com">tjmax@tnweb.com</A>&#41;, February 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>i read an interview of stephen kings, and he was talking about how he used to do a lot of acid&#40;lsd&#41;. i wonder how he got so imaginative  <BR>hmmm.......  <BR> <BR>-- Crimson &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Crimson@antisocial.com">Crimson@antisocial.com</A>&#41;, February 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>If I remember correctly, he stated &#40;on one of those late shows&#41; that his ideas mainly came from his nightmares. I sympathize with him, as I have the same problem, but mine are a little TOO weird to believe!  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Sorry if a reply to this is late. I haven&#39;t been on-line since I posted this.  <BR>Eagle: I like the idea of a clock monster. Then you will have to use much more strategy than usual.  <BR>Stupid: What&#39;s wrong with an all-powerful cat race? Lions, Cheetahs, Panthers, Cougars,... All working together as a peaceful and powerful society where the laws are strict, and the punishment stricter. They will fight with power, valor, and courage to overcome Moo. But there are only few left out of thousands, maybe millions, because Moo caught them off-guard and they are now struggling to survive. But on day, by banding together with other monsters, they will overcome him and pring about a new era of peace and harmony. Oooohhh. Great storyline, if you ask me! C&#39;mon!  <BR>Miss Carrie: No, I have not read any of his novels. I read fantasy and mystery. Like the Defenders of Magic Trilogy, as an example as fantasy. And The Cat Who... series as an example of mystery. Not really into horror stories. Sorry.  <BR>I&#39;m gonna try and come up for more Creating Sessions. And NO POKEMON MONSTERS! I like Pokemon as much as the next guy, but that&#39;s a whole other game series that, I feel, should remain separate from MR because they are both unique in themselves and shouldn&#39;t combine. Can&#39;t wait for Pokemon Stadium next month...!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I mean &#34;bring about a new era&#34;, not pring. My bad.  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Fine,fine let our cats rule for even the godlike monsters phoenix and Moo cant stop them.I dont really like cheetahs as much as you like lions but I use to when I was in elematary I rented books on them I drew them I thank them because all that time drawing them my drawing skills have tottaly improved and I am currently the best drawer in my shcool.In my opinion all big cats look cool in their own form of way . I also read books only fantasy books I hat science fiction because all that scientific talk gives me a headache,my favorite books are the Tolkien sereis and,the Dragonlance sereis.  <BR>Leos and Chitals rule watch your back phoenix and Moo there are a new bunch of badboyz in town.  <BR> <BR>-- stupid &#40;<A HREF="mailto:twopacliveson@hotmail.com">twopacliveson@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I suppose that you haven&#39;t seen the Fierce. It is equally as useful as your Leo and Chitin species. The only downside to it is the fact that the freak genetic coding is quite unstable. Thus, it has a little bit of a handicap when it comes to lifespan. I&#39;m still working on a new set of techniques for it &#40;my little &#34;pet project&#34;&#41;, as well as more for the Vortex species.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Some comments:  <BR>I like the idea of a clock monster! In fact, I think there is going to be a clock-owl in the new Pokemon games. I&#39;d love to see monsters like a Durahan/Vortex ... or a Monol/Vortex &#40;a grandfather clock!&#41; ... or a Mock/Vortex &#40;a cuckoo clock!&#41; ... or a Vortex/Joker &#40;a Doomclock, that goes up to 13 o&#39;clock&#41;...  <BR>And I like the idea of a kick-<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> cat monster, instead of the drunk Kato and the cute little Mew -- both of which I like, but neither of which are particularly cat-like, in my opinion. Also I&#39;d like to see a Cheetah monster... so that I could get a Cheetah/Henger and name him Cheetor! &#40;Yup, I&#39;m a Beast Machines addict, too&#41;.  <BR>As for a technology-based monster... how about a radio? At long range it could spit CDs &#40;POW-based&#41; or blare bad music &#40;INT-based.&#41; At closer ranges, it could whip its power cord, spit a tape, launch batteries... I would call it Vox, the latin word for &#34;Voice&#34;.  <BR>Oh yeah, and one of these monsters -- Vortex, Cheetah, or Vox -- has to have Orange as it&#39;s &#34;color&#34;. They need a monster who&#39;s disc chip color is orange instead of another shade of yellow :P  <BR> <BR>-- Bill Mick &#40;<A HREF="mailto:otterzero@hotmail.com">otterzero@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Cheetor! YEAH BABY! And I might make a Tiger monster, combine it with a Henger, and BOOM! Tigertron! OOOHHH...&#42;Shiver&#42; Too bad there wasn&#39;t any lion robots on the series.  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Hey, Stupid, read the Defenders of Magic Trilogy? It&#39;s in the Dragonlance series. It&#39;s really good.  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>.....or better yet, combine a Tiger/Phoenix and make a tiger hawk  <BR> <BR>-- Midnite Wolf &#40;<A HREF="mailto:fhslhod@HiWAAY.net">fhslhod@HiWAAY.net</A>&#41;, February 16, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Creating Session 7: Chef? <BR>greenspun.com : LUSENET : Monster Rancher 2 : One Thread  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure many of you have played Star Ocean: The Second Story. You could cook. What if you could cook food for your monster? Come up with some dishes. I KNOW this is lame, but I try to release one session a day. Gotta go, I&#39;m taking up the phone line &#40;I&#39;m in my friend&#39;s house. My house has a separate phone line for the internet.&#41; Laters!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000  <BR>Answers <BR>Like Lobster Patte on his/her birthday.  <BR> <BR>-- Wheel Gator &#40;<A HREF="mailto:MyersDCM@email.msn.com">MyersDCM@email.msn.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll cook metal scraps for my henger!!!!  <BR> <BR>-- Jiggypuff &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ongyn@singnet.com.sg">ongyn@singnet.com.sg</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>i would get iron chef chen kenichi to cook for my metalner.  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>baked colt  <BR>colt satay  <BR>colt salad  <BR>colt soup  <BR>etc...  <BR> <BR>-- onomiba &#40;<A HREF="mailto:abimono@mailcity.com">abimono@mailcity.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Oh Mighty Celious. .that&#39;s a Great idea but is this about? Yes, I played Start Ocean second story. I was wondering why the hell everybody was selling real foods. I had no idea that you could cook.  <BR> <BR>-- Master Grey Wolf &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Greywolf456@hotmail.com">Greywolf456@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Yeah, Star Ocean&#39;s cooking and item creation system kicked <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>... although I had to go out and buy the strategy guide. Normally I don&#39;t like to buy commercial strategy guides, but I was starting to stay up late at night trying out EVERY combination of ingredients and herbs and metalworking combos...  <BR>It would be cool if there were all different kinds of food you could feed your monsters, and it would make sense that some would love certain food items, but others would hate them...  <BR>Carrot cake, instead of birthday cake. Hares, centaurs, and bakus would love this one, but don&#39;t feed it to a plant or a mock! They might be related to the carrots!  <BR>RAM chips. Hengers and Metalners would love these, but other monsters wouldn&#39;t know what to do with them. &#91;I got this from Mystery Science Theatre 3000... there&#39;s an episode where Joel bribes the robots with &#34;yummy RAM chips&#34;&#93;  <BR>Hey! Sorry to get distracted, but I just got an idea... what if I was stuck on a monster ranch with a Henger and a Love Seeker &#40;the red Metalner/Pixie&#41; and forced to watch bad movies... it would be just like Mystery Science Theatre 3000! We could watch movies like &#34;Night of the Lepus&#34; which is about giant Hares!  <BR>While I&#39;m not making any sense... did anyone else think it was funny when you get Bajarls... my roomates and I were laughing at Colt&#39;s conversation with the builder guy so much. &#34;Hey, what are you doing with that pot? I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to have to take that pot.&#34; Must have been a heck of a party after that! Hahaha...  <BR>Okay, enough from me today :&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- Bill Mick &#40;<A HREF="mailto:otterzero@hotmail.com">otterzero@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>So I&#39;m &#34;Mighty&#34; now, huh? Cool. I think I just raised up in rank or somethin&#39;. And you can&#39;t feed chocolate to Tigers. Chocolate is poisonous to dogs and since wolves are members of the dog family, you would think that the same would apply to them as well. The same for cats. And it would be cool if you could make them special treats for winning the tourneys. And special cakes and dinners for their birthdays. I wonder what comes after the &#34;Mighty&#34; rank around here?.... Hmmmmm... &#34;Awsome&#34;?  <BR>Birthday Cakes: Carrot, Black Forest, Cherry, Strawberry, Lemon....  <BR>Special Treats: Sweet Butter Rolls, Cream Puffs, Death By Chocolate...  <BR>Special Dinners: Five Cheese Lasagna, <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> Au Vin &#40;Pronounced <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>-Au- Vahn&#41;, Mushroom Chicken....  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Hey Bill, that was prtty funny. I liked Mystery Science theater 3000, too bad they canceled it. And as for pot, I am not going to say anything about that.  <BR> <BR>-- Miss Carrie &#40;<A HREF="mailto:musicality1@earthlink.net">musicality1@earthlink.net</A>&#41;, February 07, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I would give my Kato sardines.  <BR> <BR>-- Fritz 7 &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Ghostman12@hotmail.com">Ghostman12@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 07, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I would get a Chef &#40;Ghost/???&#41; to cook for me and my monster because I&#39;m lazy.  <BR> <BR>-- Fritz 7 &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Ghostman12@hotmail.com">Ghostman12@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 07, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Sorry that my post is a little late this time.  <BR>What about having items such as:  <BR> <BR>Ice Cream - Increases the effectiveness of ice based techniques. This would be good for Jill, Ducken, and &#40;of course&#41; Tiger species. Consequently, it would be harmful to Dragon, Zuum, Kato, and Phoenix species.  <BR> <BR>Hot Coals - Icrease the effectiveness of fire based techniques. This would be good for Dragon, Zuum, Kato, and Phoenix species. Has a neutral effect on Pixie species. Harmful to Jill, Tiger, Ducken, and any moster with ice based techniques.  <BR> <BR>Nuts &#39;N Bolts - A mechenized treat for boosting technological techniques. Best used with Henger, Metalner, and Monol species. It is dangerous for Golem, Plant, Mock, and Jell species.  <BR> <BR>Nature Candy - Natural forestry that increases the techniques of natural monsters. Best used on Golem, Plant, Mock, Worm, Beaclon, and Jell species. Weakens Henger, Metalner, Monol, and any other monster that is not created from natural surroundings.  <BR> <BR>Mammals Milk - Increases the effectiveness of warm-blooded techniques. It is best used on Hare, Ape, Tiger, Pixie, Ducken, Mocchi. It is harmful to Zuum, Naga, Jell, Gaboo, and any other cold- blooded monster.  <BR> <BR>Reptilian Scale - This item is used to increase the defense of cold- blooded monsters. It is best used on Zuum, Dragon, Naga, Jell, and Gaboo species. It is harmful to Hare, Ape, Tiger, Pixie, Ducken, and Mocchi species.  <BR> <BR>Nail File - The iron in this item will make bad natured monsters more aggressive in combat.

Make a monster with a &#34;job&#34;, that is, maybe a veterinarian monster or a dentist. A dentist. That&#39;s a good one. Also, make scenarios involving your monster. Raising your monster could make special events happen if certain qualifications are met. You could come up with attacks and cards too, if you wish. Like a dentist could use a big drill, for example. Try not to make a same job monster if someone else has before you. The dentist and vet are open. They were just examples. If you really want to use a job that someone else has done, give more ideas for their monster that you came up with. Get it? Got it? Good. Laters!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 06, 2000  <BR>Answers <BR>By making a monster dentist it might scare young children from going to the dentist.  <BR>Remember this game was made with children in mind, I&#39;m not saying there is anything wrong with adults playing it but, try not to make it over Y7.  <BR> <BR>-- tjmax &#40;<A HREF="mailto:tjmax@tnweb.com">tjmax@tnweb.com</A>&#41;, February 07, 2000.  <BR> <BR>How about a monster policeman? They can come and arrest all the evil monsters :&#41; Then the evil monsters would have to train in jail...  <BR>Ooh, or a monster mechanic! They could help repair the hengers and metalners who get hurt on expedition, or build improvements on them.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-- Bill Mick &#40;<A HREF="mailto:otterzero@hotmail.com">otterzero@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 07, 2000.  <BR> <BR>This is copied from one of my old &#34;wish list&#34; post responses.  <BR> <BR>3.&#41; The ability to choose your profession. For example, if you are a trainer, you may someday take Master Pabs place &#40;or whoever is in charge&#41; and have to raise monsters to defeat challengers battling for the Hall of Fame. Consequently, you may even have battles with different organizations, &#40;IMA, FIMBA, etc.&#41; each having a different array of monsters to chose from. After, defeating a foreign challenger, maybe you could get the ability to unlock a few of HIS/HER organizations monsters. Or maybe take on the role of the lab guy, and have to search all over the world to find items that can be merged to create new species of monsters. I think that would be cool!!!  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 07, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I have a really dark sense of humor so here goes  <BR> <BR>Hooker/prostetute-Pixie,Colt-you know who these are  <BR> <BR>Policedog-Hopper,Tiger-they chase criminals and bad monsters and occasionally try to dig up drugs and needles in parks,and also beat up drunks  <BR>Marijuana  <BR> <BR>gardener-Mock,plant-In business there are the sellers,the buyers and the growers  <BR> <BR>Poachers-Durahans,Wrackys-Hey a monsters got to make a living  <BR> <BR>Scrap metal-Metalner,Henger-DDDDDUUUUHHHH!  <BR>Rubble-Golem-DDDDUUUHHH!  <BR> <BR>-- stupid &#40;<A HREF="mailto:twopacliveson@hotmail.com">twopacliveson@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 08, 2000.
