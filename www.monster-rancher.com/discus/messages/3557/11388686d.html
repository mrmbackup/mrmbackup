 Here’s chap. 4, all set and ready ta go!:P &#42;wow, I feel like I’m repeating myself. Aww, well&#42; <BR> <BR> <BR>After the battle with James and his Centaur, Jamaru was now determined more than ever to win that battle. Every week I insisted that he’d take a rest, but instead would refuse the offer. And, as usual, one flick of his favorite vegetable and he would obey. Funny how easily some monsters are persuaded by just food. I guess you could say that for me, too. <BR> <BR>After three weeks of training, fighting and resting, it was finally time to head on down to the tournament. Jamaru was pumped up and so confident, and I….well….didn’t know where we were going. <BR> <BR>“So, we take this road and then turn left here, right?” Jamaru pointed to a narrow picture of a road on a billboard map we came across. <BR> <BR>“No, no I don’t think we go left, I think we go right. See? Right here.” I pointed the opposite way Jamaru was. We both looked at each other, then gave out a deep sigh. <BR> <BR>“We’re lost, aren’t we?” <BR> <BR>“Hold on, let me check the invitation again.” I pulled out from my coat pocket the letter I had received three weeks ago. I carefully examined it again. And again. And again. “Darn it! You’d think they’d give you instructions to where the stadium is!” I sat down back first against the map’s pole. Jamaru did the same thing. <BR> <BR>“Maybe we should…ya know…..ask for directions or something?” <BR> <BR>“Maybe we should. I think we’re like late anyway.” I started to look around if anyone was around, but to my despair, not even a tumbleweed passed by. <BR> <BR>“Forget it. Let’s just go.” Jamaru then got up, stretched his front paws, and started walking South. <BR> <BR>“Jamaru! What if you’re going the wrong way?!” I got up at that point. <BR> <BR>“Whatever. I’ll just let this road take me to wherever it leads.” I sighed and started walking after him. That was so like Jamaru: doesn’t care where he goes just as long as it goes somewhere. We traveled what seemed like hours on a dirt road that leaded us probably all the way to Brillia. Later on, Jamaru just gave up and collapsed on the dirt path. <BR> <BR>“I give up. This road leads to nowhere! End of story!” I dragged Jamaru to the side and sat right next to him. <BR> <BR>“Well, what’d you think? That the stadium would be right next –door?” I giggled a little at Jamaru, who was even too tired to argue with me. I figured that he might. Figuring that we wouldn’t get to the stadium any time soon, I pulled out my sketchbook, flipped to a random page and started on a new drawing. Jamaru was still too tired to even notice what I was doing, but I still continued on. <BR> <BR>About half an hour passed us, and still, we were sitting on our bums on the side of the road. I figured that the sign up for the tournament was over all ready, so I just relaxed and drew. I know Jamaru would take it pretty hard, so I decided not to wake him up. I sighed and took a little break from my doodling, and looked out south towards the road. I was really starting to wonder if Jamaru was right about taking this path. For that, I wouldn’t know. <BR> <BR>As much as I was surprised, I actually heard something coming down the road. I looked around with excitement, then turned my direction over down North. In the distance, I could see a…actually, I’ve never seen this monster before. It was even stranger than Charles. This monster was a small orange turtle / dinosaur with a large green hump mounted on its back. Various green gauntlets surrounded its arm, while wearing…wooden shoes? Well, at least I thought they were, but honestly, I couldn’t tell. The monster was moving too fast for me to even notice.  <BR> <BR>Before I could even react to this, the monster ran straight up to Jamaru and I, and stopped. By the looks of it, the monster seemed to be a ‘horse’ for…whatever was in the cart. But whatever was behind the cloths over the cart, it spoke to the both of us. <BR> <BR>“You guys heading towards the tournament?” Jamaru, at this point, slowly woke up from his little dog nap. <BR> <BR>“Well, we were, until we got lost, that is. I figured that the sign ups were over anyway, so…” <BR> <BR>“So, what?” I looked up to see that the cloth was now gone and revealed a some – what tall girl with dark blonde hair. Her smile seemed to lighten up my negativity. “Just because your late, doesn’t mean that you missed everything, right?” <BR> <BR>“Uhhh…right?” I started to stand up from my sitting position. I looked over to the girl’s…unique monster, only to find Jamaru sniffing around it. The girl only laughed softly. <BR> <BR>“It would seem that your monster is interested in mine, am I not right?” her monster only backed a little away from Jamaru’s curious nose. <BR> <BR>“Not to be rude or anything, but I don’t think I’ve seen a monster like that before. What is it?” the girl smiled back to me. <BR> <BR>“This is my Madillo, Serenity. She’s very sweet, but she doesn’t really talk a whole lot.” This got me a little confused. <BR> <BR>“A Madillo? I don’t think I’ve heard of a monster like that before.” <BR> <BR>“Well, technically, it’s a new monster that people are discovering now. This was a gift from my Dad before I left the farm.” Her smile turned towards Jamaru. “And it looks like that you got yourself a nice monster, too!” I transfixed my eyes to Jamaru, who was now trying to make friends with Serenity. How cute. <BR> <BR>“Oh, yeah, this is my Tiger, Jamaru. He can be quite a talker, that he can.” I motioned him to come back over, in which he did. The girl sat back down in the cart, then turned her attention over to me. <BR> <BR>“Well, do ya want a lift? I’d be more than happy to take you to the tournament!” She placed her hand to the empty space next to her, motioning me to climb aboard. <BR> <BR>“No, I couldn’t possibly…” <BR> <BR>“But I’m insisting!” I looked over to Jamaru, who now was giving me his usual ‘sad puppy’ look. <BR> <BR>“Please, Cleo? Pwetty Pwease?” I finally sighed at the begging dog next to me. <BR> <BR>“All right then.” I bowed my head to the girl. “Thank you for the offer.” <BR> <BR>“You’re welcome.” She said as I was climbing into the cart. I saw Jamaru walking next to Serenity, gripping his teeth on the pole of the cart. I knew that he’d want to help pull the cart as well. The girl whistled loudly, and off Serenity and Jamaru went, pulling the cart behind them. A little while into the ride, the girl placed her hand in the air by my side. <BR> <BR>“By the way, my name’s Dehlia Emperium. And yours?” I shook her hand warmly. <BR> <BR>“The name’s Cleo Makaru. It’s nice to meet you.” <BR> <BR>“Likewise, I’m sure.” Again, she gave out a hearty smile. And I’m pretty sure for a fact that I really liked it when she smiled. It was a nice gesture. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Okee dokee, then! Fourth one is done! Comments are always appreciated, so..yeah!^_^
