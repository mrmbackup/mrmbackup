The Journey of the Jells <BR> <BR>Chapter 12:The End of the Journey, It’s Been a  <BR>Good Fight <BR> <BR>	Minion discussed plans with the remains of  <BR>the once powerful team.  <BR>	“I think we should give up. We have been  <BR>searching for two months, and nothing.   <BR>Gengen’s probably hidden in a cave up in  <BR>Papas.  We’re not gonna find sh&#42;t!” he  <BR>exclaimed angrily, slamming his hand down  <BR>on the cup of deluxe coffee made for the  <BR>presidents of IMa, smashing the one hundred  <BR>fifty dollar mug into one hundred tiny pieces,  <BR>slicing his hand, and spilling hot coffee all  <BR>over himself.   He didn’t seem to notice. <BR>	Big Bob nodded.  He had been promoted to  <BR>Vice President of FIMBA Monster Associetion.   <BR>“It’s no use,” he said slowly, choosing his  <BR>words wisely, “Gengen is a lunatic.  He also  <BR>happens to be a great guy, so Baxter’s alive.   <BR>Unfortunatly, he’s also a smart guy, so we  <BR>won’t find him.  There are armies of humans  <BR>and monsters working together to find him,  <BR>but it won’t happen.” <BR>	&#40;BTW, Steele is in the looney bin&#41;. <BR>	Scaler stood up to his feet angrily.  “You’re  <BR>gonna give up a search for our friend Baxter  <BR>who stuck the whole thing through with us?   <BR>You’re just gonna forget about him?!” <BR>	Veins in Minion were like ice, his heart was  <BR>failing, but Minion forced it to be like ice to, as  <BR>he said coldly “Yes.” <BR>	It sounded better and colder than he felt, and  <BR>he felt even worse when Scaler staggered.   <BR>Grabbing his heart section, Scaler gasped  <BR>weezing breaths, gasping “<I>help...</I>” <BR>	Minion could see that something was truly  <BR>wrong.  He shouted for a doctor, and they  <BR>rushed Scaler to a hospital.  <BR>	“<I>What’s wrong with Scaler!</I>” Minion  <BR>shouted.  It was no question, it was an order. <BR>	The doctor tried to sooth him, but he kept  <BR>demanding.  Finally, she broke down and told  <BR>him that his heart had failed, and that he had  <BR>gone on and passed away.  The ice inside  <BR>Minion shattered.  He would go on with his life  <BR>living in a large home in IMa’s capitol, but he  <BR>would never again be the same.  And here is  <BR>where we’ll say goodbye to the Jells.  Well,  <BR>most of them.  				 <BR> <BR>							&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>	A sprawled Mr. Freeze body upon a large rock  <BR>in the deepest part of the jungle.  A Phoenix  <BR>body lay beside him, the fires on him still  <BR>crackling.  A feather fell off, onto Mr. Freeze’s  <BR>caracass.  The feather bore a hole in him,  <BR>drawing blood.    The feather sucked up the  <BR>blood like a leech.  The feather grew fat, then  <BR>exploded.  A red shining thing that can only be  <BR>described as “Hate” lifted up.  It fell on a rock,  <BR>waiting for it’s victim. <BR>							&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>	Gengen clutched the orb of Baxter close to his  <BR>chest, hiding it under his cloak, in the famous  <BR>Torble Sea seaport, Barracuda.  Life around  <BR>him was busy, people buying supplies for  <BR>their journeys, people buying souviniers and t- <BR>shirts.  He slowly slithered his way to a large  <BR>ship that was leaving, <B>Jello’s Junk</B>. <BR>	“YO!” he called, screaming at the Jell captain.   <BR>	The pure Jell walked down to Gengen.  “Why,  <BR>Gen, after all these years, you--” he was cut  <BR>short by Gengen shoving a hand inside the  <BR>Jell’s stomach and pulling out his orb, and  <BR>then placing Baxter’s in there.  He then threw  <BR>the captain’s orb into the water.  He led a  <BR>dazed Baxter &#40;in the captain’s body&#41; inside the  <BR>ship and told the sailors to set sail.  He then  <BR>bore a hole in the bottom two days later and  <BR>took a safety boat with a drugged Baxter away  <BR>at midnight, going toward the island of Gaiu,  <BR>where he had already been claimed president  <BR>and was building an army.  Gaiu people were  <BR>mad that IMa and FIMBA ignored them, and  <BR>wanted to rebel, so Gengen was helping them  <BR>by being president.  It would be slow, but it  <BR>would be a pleasure. <BR>							&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>	Otto froze each member of his army and then  <BR>himself.  His last thought was: <BR>	<I>When the time comes...</I> <BR>						&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>	Mudd was still walking in the jungle, eating  <BR>animals and enjoying himself in the  <BR>wilderness.  He had seen the smoke from the  <BR>Phoenix’s dead body, and had come to spit on  <BR>the flames.  As he walked into the clearing  <BR>with both parts of Burner, he saw a bright red,  <BR>shiny stone.  It had bad vibes...like Hate itself.   <BR>Maybe it was Hate itself.  Still, Mudd was a  <BR>sucker for bright stones that might cost a lot,  <BR>so, like the sucker he is, he picked it up.  The  <BR>pain was unbearable.  It was like a fire  <BR>burning inside.  His eyes started smoking.  He  <BR>tried to drop it, but it was burned into his hand.   <BR>There was a fire inside his skull!  He was  <BR>melting!  His last effort went toward looking at  <BR>his hand, and he saw in horror that it had a  <BR>drawing of a flame carved on it...then he  <BR>melted.   <BR>	A sickly laugh that sounded a lot like Burner’s  <BR>echoed through the woods.  It was, however,  <BR>not Burners.  The rock melted also and it  <BR>made a puddle blood red.  From the puddle  <BR>rose a form   First the head was oval shaped,  <BR>like a human’s, and on it there were two  <BR>terrifying yellow slits for eyes.  The mouth was  <BR>big...but it wasn’t the mouth you noticed.  It  <BR>was the teeth.  He had six inch sharp teeth,  <BR>and they were so big they curved outwards.   <BR>Next came the body. It was bloodred, and on  <BR>the back were two dragon wings, the size of a  <BR>Dragon’s wings.  He had Jell-like arms, then  <BR>the hands were two huge Dragon claws.  He  <BR>was part Jell, part Dragon, part Hate. <BR>	He was the son of Burner.  He smiled a nasty  <BR>smile.  He was Flame. <BR> <BR> <BR>		<B>THE END OF THE JOURNEY OF THE  <BR>JELLS</B>

 &#34;Flame&#34; will be up tomorrow, hopefully.  &#40;I  <BR>didn&#39;t want to start a new thread just for that&#41;.  I  <BR>was expecting it to be here Sunday, but things  <BR>just didn&#39;t work out at ALL.  Sorry.  Anyway, if  <BR>it&#39;s not tomorrow, it&#39;ll be this weekend.  I have it  <BR>all typed, I just have to edit the stupid scenes  <BR>and copy it onto a disk, so I&#39;m ready to take  <BR>over the world yet again.

 Hmmmm....it seems like you added more sense I last read this one. I did read it somewhere else, but Scaler didn&#39;t die in that one. I like it! The one thing I enjoy over all is the fact that there is not just one plot brewing. Otto looks as if he&#39;ll pull wildcard duty for a while. I&#39;ll guess we&#39;ll see.

 Actually...the last chapter posted in the old  <BR>board was I belive eight or nine.  Again, it&#39;s  <BR>probably just what you said &#40;I&#39;m not even  <BR>gonna ATTEMPT to spell that&#41;.
