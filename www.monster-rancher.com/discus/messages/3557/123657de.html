 &#34;What of the Joker? His name was Vibrant if I&#39;m not mistaken. Where is he?&#34;,A thunderous voice filled a dark chasim deep in the heart of a mountain, &#34;Well?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Three dragons stood beside a towering throne. Their red eyes being their only visable feature. The throne was part way enclosed in the darkness. Two, massive legs protruded from the blackness, with a firm grip on the cobalt floor. Black claws resided on both as feet, with some type of blue shin armour on above them. The knees each had a solitary spike pointing up towards the glass roof, eerily being illuminated by the occasional thunder. A mighty hand grasped the arm of the massive throne. Each knuckle on the human like hand had a small, blue spike pointing forward over the fingures, which were wrapped around the edge of their prop. The other hand was in the darkness and, much like the spikes, was seen only in the breif instants of thunder. Along with those, the chest could be seen by the ramdom light. Human like, with armour clearly on. The armour itself had no protruding parts. It was very smooth. The desighn was of two bolts of lightning coming up from his waste. Each bolt swirled into circles on each side of the chest ragoin. A dark, cape-like covering fell over each shoulder and draped down both sides of the massive charactor. <BR> <BR> <BR>The four pairs of eyes in the dark focused on one object, a kneeling band of mercinaries before them. The obvious leader rose to address the huge form in the darkness. He was a Jill, unlike any other. His band consisted of all pure-bred Jills, but he was different. His name was Stormer and was very appropriate for him. He was slightly taller then the others and was a bit wider as well. Instead of covering his arms with his hair, he proudly boasted of them and showed them off quite often. He rarely covered the two, very muscular arms. His hair was totally black, not pure black. More of a grayish black. He had two, deep red eyes. <BR> <BR> <BR>He stared into the darkness and, never being the one to fear anyone, stated, &#34;He was a bother to us and hampered or work. I personally dispatched him. He wasn&#39;t as much of an asset or a combatant as you said.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Up to this point, Stormer had his arms tucked away. Now, he proudly revieled them, and flexed accordingly. His troops did the same. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;See how they admire me. I love being the strongest alive.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>The eyes around the throne shot towards the pack of Jills, then fell towards the throne. The massive hand rose a small distance in the air. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Is that so?&#34;, The voice bellowed, &#34;Well, let me be the first to change your mind. However, because of your continued feats, I give you one chance. Revoke your boast or be prepared to die. One snap of my fingure and you will be torn to shread by my Knights of Darkness. Their name fits them quite well I might add. Seeing you are no match for me, I will allow them to play with you and your band. If you win, you may challenge me. The only options are to take that back or die. Well?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>The mighty Jill stared in defiance, &#34;Never! I am the strongest. Me and my party shall destroy you!&#34; The other Jills seemed to be with him. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Very well.&#34; The massive voice rang. His hand turned into a snapping position. Silence fell over the entire room. Even the rain seemed to stop momentarily to allow a single sound to echo throughout the mountain, a snap. The dargons immediately dove from the darkness. Each was of no known breed to man-kind. They landed in front of the throne, each hissing towards their opponants. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Give the word master,&#34; One called out towards the throne. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;...attack.&#34; The voice finally said. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;YES!&#34; One of the dragons screamed as they all charged towards the Jills. Moments later, blood covered the floor and bodies lie in a pile at the foot of the throne. Two of the dragons had Stormer&#39;s arms and had forced him to one knee before the throne. A slight laughter cut through the silence. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Your fiends beat me, not you!&#34; Stormer yelled. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;....let him go.&#34; The thunderous voice rang forth from the blackness. <BR> <BR> <BR>The dragons didn&#39;t question his authority. They realized at an early age to go against him was ludicrous and unhealthy to say the least. The Jill stood and prepared to attack. The hand of the being rose into the air and pointed towards the battle hardened Stormer. His fingures became out-stretched as a small glow filled his palm. It began to glow a golden color as he clasped it. The Jill knew the true meaning of fear now. The fist opened quickly to unleash a golden ray of energy at the Jill. Stormer attempted to block the shot by braceing his foot and crossing his arms over his face. The golden light hit the Jill with such force that it carried him across the room. Stormer found himself slammed into the far wall, the surgeing energy still burning at his crossed arms. The energy faded as the hand turned into a pointing fingure. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Had enough? The tip of the ice-berg as you might say. Want to feel a tad bit more of my wrath?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>The Jill stumbled out of his imprint in the wall. He looked at the ground to see that his feet&#39;s imprint put two, long scrapes along the floor. That was because his grip on the floor was indeed a solid one. He had been pushed into a wall and the marks on the floor that lead to him told the whole story. He then looked at his forarms, No hair remained, burned off in a sad attempt to block the attack. The dragons snickered in the darkness. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;You....caught me off guard. Thats it...yeah...you caught me off guard!&#34; Stormer put his hands together in and axe-handle manner, &#34;My turn.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>The massive creature rose from his throne in the darkness, his cape falling over his entire body, except his legs. His face was still not visable. He sighed a bit and then said mockingly, &#34;If you must.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>The Jill became enraged and, with a loud battle cry, blue energy beams shot between his locked fingures. He ran towards the considerably larger being and screamed, &#34;SLEDGE OF POWER!&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>A massive war-hammer appeared in his hands. He threw it strait at the being in the darkness. The hammer hit around the chest area. The explosion was huge. Peices of the throne room flew everywhere. The dragons stared on. The Jill had a crazed look on his face. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I AM THE MIGHTIEST!&#34; The Jill screamed as the dust was setteling. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Fool...&#34; One of the dragons spoke. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;&#34;What! You want some too?&#34; The Jill turned to his right. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;If we defeated you...and you defeated him..&#34; Another voice spoke from the left. <BR> <BR> <BR>Stormer turned and said, &#34;Then you serve me?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, think about it. If you are stronger.&#34; A third voice spoke from above. <BR> <BR> <BR>The Jill looked up, &#34;I-I-I&#39;m your new master?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;If we could defeat you then why oh why...&#34;, the dragon from his left said, &#34;...did we serve him?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>The Jill looked puzzeled, &#34;What do you mean?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Why would we...&#34;, the one on his left said, &#34;...serve him?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>The one in the raptures whispered to the Jill, yet it was load enough for all to hear, &#34;Why would we serve a weaker master? If we can defeat you, then we could have defeated him, right?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes...I suppose.&#34; The Jill said, thinking he was getting the picture. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;But...&#34;, One of the dragons said, &#34;...we defeated you. How could we not beat him?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Stormer felt a sinking feeling deep in his gut, &#34;Because he is more powerful....&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>He stared into the throne, in it sat the creature he thought he had beaten. Not even a scratch on it. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Fall in troops. Introduce yourselves.&#34; The voice bellowed. <BR> <BR> <BR>From above a dragon landed in front of the terrified Jill. He was a tall one, the one from the raptures. He looked almost robotic, except he was purple. His wings had clear definition of their power. The mechanics of him were only in his arms, muscle enhancers. His stare was a cold one. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Nightmare, Lord of Illusion. A trickster by my reputaion.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>A slighty smaller one appeared from left. He was plated with armour, but not an armoured dragon. His armour was a silver color, it ran down his chest and ran into his legs. His arms had some armour, but not as much. Probably for fighting purposes. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Dragonaught, Lord of Chaos. I love battle and war-fare. That is were my name best suits me.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>A third dragon strolled in from the right, he was the same size as the one called Nightmare. He was the most fearsome looking of the bunch. He had his wings wrapped around his blue body. He spread them, revieling not one, but two pairs of arms. Each of the four arms had a pair of fingure-less gloves. Each glove had five studs on the back and were obviously strechted a bit. The gloves themselves were a blueish color, much like the dragon which bared them. His face was longer then most, his ears were long and slim. He also had two large spikes on the joint of each of his wings. One on each wing. He gave the Jill a long stare before saying. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Galin, Lord of Destruction. I am the begining and the end. I do what ever my dark master wishes.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>The dragons parted from there spot in the chamber to allow the dark one to come down from his throne. He was huge, massive. A monstrosity of towering strength and wisdom. He stood over the quivering Stormer as he looked down upon him. He was some ten feet taller then the Jill, perhps fifteen. By far the largest in the chamber. The Jill himself was at least ten, this he knew. The beast was not just any monster, this he could see thanks in part to the lightning. He was a dragon. He was a dark blue dragon and looked some what like Galin. He also had four arms, each pair was crossed as he unfurled his wings. He had not had a cape on after all, those were his wings. However, he wasn&#39;t entirely a dragon. He had a dragon head, yes. Yet something was wrong. No long neck, no arched stance. He walked upright, like a golem. He had a neck, but it was more human or golem like. No...more like a naga. It was like a naga head because of the neck and the overall shape of the head. However, he had two legs and stood upright. No tail. The Jill was confused by what it was. He clearly was stronger. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Kingston, Lord of Death. I revel in the thought of blood and death. I enjoy the smell of plague and the warfare of the humans. They will, however, pay for making us fight for them. I was once a weapon, but know I seek revenge. Before I do, I believe we have an unfinished transaction.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>With this, he uncurled his massive arms and got in a comfortable stance. Then, with blinding speed, one of his bottom arms shot at the Jill. Stormer caught it in the chest and flew across the room again. The fist was almost as big as the Jill himself. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Alas, none can put up a suitable fight for me. Dragonaught? Nightmare? Care to take some shots?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;No thank you, my lord,&#34; Nightmare replied, &#34;I believe we are already full of Jills for the day.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>The massive creature stared at the third, &#34;Son?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank you for the pleasure father.&#34; Galin said as walked towards the Jill, who was finally standing. <BR> <BR> <BR>Galin shot towards the Jill, charging his shoulder into it. Stormer flew into the corner of the room. Galin faced the corner in which the Jill was standing. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;THERMAL CLAW!&#34; Galin spread his wings back. He put each of his claws into a half-curled fist. Each of his fingures began to glow a brillant blue. Then, the light turned into a set of laser like claws over each of his fingures. He flew into the corner, hands moving with blinding speed as the screams of the Jill were deafening. The other two looked on, applauding, while his father, Lord Kingston, looked on and with a sense of pride in his voice said, &#34;Thats my boy.&#34; As he said this, a piece of the Stormer&#39;s arm landed beside him. He stared down at it and, with a curl of his nose, said simply, &#34;...damnit son.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Enjoy! CHB &#40; Black Razor I hpoe you don&#39;t mind me using your format for my stories. It is just a lot easier to read. &#41;
