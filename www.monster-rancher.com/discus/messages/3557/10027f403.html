 Kale gently brushed his hand on the long, yellow wheat that tugged at his armor. He strolled calmly through this field, with cheerful birds sounding their calls. He looked toward the sky, watching their shadows dance in front of him with a backdrop of blue mixed with white clouds. Kale smiled as the gentle warmth of a sun lit day seemed to rain on him, and the breeze that slowly lifted his hair gave him a feeling of serenity, security. <BR> <BR>All this beauty was obscured by one thing; a dank, blackened path at the tree line. All the trees here were healthy, save the ones closest to this dirt road. They were blackened and charred, leafless and dying. Kale saw something lumbering down the trail. Large, hulking, it moved away from him in no hurry, but slowly it put one foot in front of the other. <BR> <BR>Kale, with no act of conciseness nor sanity, began stepping toward the path. The form faded into darkness, and Kale lost sight of it. He stopped only once, at the entrance to this way. The birds went silent, the breeze hid from Kale now, even the sky had darkened as a few rouge clouds masked the sun&#39;s rays. Kale took it all in briefly, then placed his right foot on this trail of death. <BR> <BR>Kale&#39;s pace hastened to catch up with whatever that thing was. Kale wasn&#39;t running, but somewhat jogging, hastily eyeing the woods on either side of him. He came to a junction of sorts, several dozen paths collided off just this one. He looked around frantically as he stood in the center of this hub, not sure which path he had taken to get here. <BR> <BR>He heard it then. The roar, the cry, the pain. Something wicked pierced the silence. Kale clasped for his weapons, but found none there. He began turning, faster and faster, trying to keep an eye on each trail, to see this thing coming ahead of time. The scream was loader this time, more high pitched. Kale clasped his head and bent over, trying to cover his ears. He rose, turning, ever turning, trying not to be caught off guard by whatever this was. <BR> <BR>Kale&#39;s vision was becoming blurry, dizzy even. He stopped slightly as a still shadow caught his view, totally obstructing one of the paths. The silence sank in hard now, as he stared at this figure. Kale&#39;s vision was blurry, and he could tell nothing more than it was bigger than he was. His vision began to clear slightly, began to unfog, then he could see. Then he wished he couldn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>&#34;What...the...&#34; Kale stammered as he took a few steps back. <BR> <BR>The creature was hunched, eyes fixated on Kale. A trail of blood followed it up the path to its feet, were blood dripped into a puddle from various sources. Its eye were blank, and gave off an eerie sense of emptiness only death could offer. Its entire body seemed soaked, wet from some source or another. It had lost a lot of its original color since the last time Kale saw it, but the hole in its chest remained open and the jutting, jagged bone protruding just past the left elbow only fortified what Kale feared most. <BR> <BR>It hunched forward slightly and screamed again. A heart wrenching sound bellowed forth from its maw, and Kale stammered in surprise, and fear. He turned to run, only to find the beast their now. Before Kale could react, there was another vicious roar and he saw only claws and teeth flashing. His vision jerked around in all directions, only catching glimpses of his attacker. Blood was splashing across his field of vision. Everything started turning red as Kale felt his body being torn apart. <BR> <BR>Kale sat strait up in his bed with a slight yelp. Sweat not only beaded up on his body, but had actually soaked his entire bed. He glanced around nervously, and his eyes eventually rested on Clymain. He was quiet asleep, sprawled out on his bed with one leg hanging off, slack jawed and about as comfortable as one could be in this misbegotten place. <BR> <BR>Kale stood slowly, his hands and legs were shaking unbelievably. He fumbled his way to the window, and opened it, hoping the air outside would calm his nerves, no matter how wretched the smell. Surprisingly, Kale could see moonlight through the cracks, and a lot of it. <BR> <BR>However, as Kale opened the window, he heard it. The roar, the scream, it had followed him right out of his nightmare and materialized itself in the real world. Kale fell back from the window as the sound entered his chamber. He landed on his back, eyes to the window, widened in horror and disbelief. He found himself scurrying back from the window, eyes never removed from it, and his breathing was irregular to say the least. <BR> <BR>Kale jumped again and let out a yelp as a humanoid figure landed in front of him, the silhouette against the window was large. It hunched slightly, and was also standing, this made it seem impressively larger than before. Kale pushed off his hands and feet with very little success as the shadow fell on him. He jerked slightly as a hand grasped each of his shoulders with a firm shake. <BR> <BR>&#34;Kale, snap out of it. Are you all right?&#34; Clymain&#39;s voice seemed almost angelic compared to that roar. <BR> <BR>Kale said nothing, but merely stared at the shadow, unable to see his face against the moonlight that flooded the room. His breathing eased slightly, he gazed into the form before him with blank and bewildered eyes. <BR> <BR>&#34;Did you....hear it?&#34; Kale caught, between quickened breathes, the state of mind to even ask. <BR> <BR>&#34;I heard something, but I didn&#39;t know what it was.&#34; Clymain said as he helped Kale to his feet, &#34;When I got up, you were on the floor, I assumed it was you-&#34; <BR> <BR>The high pitched yell rang this time like a thousand cannons. Kale jumped back slightly as Clymain crouched instantly, both of them eyeing the window as the voice faded. <BR> <BR>&#34;It almost sounds in pain, or grief...&#34; Clymain said slowly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Clymain, we have to leave.&#34; Kale sputtered as he began heading towards his armor. <BR> <BR>&#34;What?&#34; Clymain asked as he looked to Kale in a stupor, &#34;Now?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Trust me, Clymain, we have to go.&#34; Kale stated as he began to quickly fasten his chest plate on. <BR> <BR>&#34;Kale, calm down, at least tell me what is happening.&#34; Clymain pleaded as he grasped Kale&#39;s arm. <BR> <BR>Kale jerked his arm away with a sharp, &#34;We got to go, NOW!&#34; <BR> <BR>Clymain looked at him a little ignorant, then the roar sounded again. Long, dragged out, it sounded heavy with sorrow. <BR> <BR>&#34;What is making that noise, Kale?&#34; Clymain requested solidly, crossing his arms, &#34;What is it?&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale slowed down as he strapped on one leg plate. He turned slightly to his old friend and said, &#34;A Caustrodon.&#34; <BR> <BR>Clymain&#39;s face didn&#39;t even change, instead he continued to stare stupidly at Kale. <BR> <BR>&#34;Its outside the walls then, and the guards should be able to handle it.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No, its in here.&#34; Kale said as he fastened his leg plate on the rest of the way. <BR> <BR>&#34;Please Kale, no beast is smart enough to get in, plus the guards will kill it or drive it away.&#34; Clymain turned about a half and looked to the window, &#34;Perhaps that&#39;s why its grieving, maybe the one we killed was a loved one.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No Clymain, its not.&#34; Kale sputtered as he slipped on his boot, hoping on one leg, &#34;Its the same one that came in with us.&#34; <BR> <BR>Clymain turned to Kale very slowly, &#34;You&#39;re being paranoid.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No. I had a dream, and it came back for me. It was the same one we killed, hole in the chest and all. Blood covered, soaking wet, its eyes were dead Clymain, I looked right into those black, dead eyes.&#34; Kale stammered and slurred half his words accompanied with various hand gestures. <BR> <BR>&#34;Kale, it is dead.&#34; Clymain protested, &#34;Dead as it will ever be. Where are you going to go to anyway?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Anywhere. I&#39;d rather take my chances with the Caustrodons outside the castle than the dead one bent on revenge inside.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Kale...&#34; Clymain said lowly as he grabbed his chest plate, &#34;I hate you.&#34; <BR> <BR>Later that night... <BR> <BR>The screams had subsided some hours ago, but the uneasy feeling still followed Kale. He and Clymain had just walked out of the tower door, into the courtyard. No need to disturb Perenolde, they&#39;d just leave in the night. If you would call this night in a place of eternal night. The moon, however, was bright and shined through several breaks in the clouds, illuminating the entire castle with excellent luminescence. <BR> <BR>Kale looked toward the wall, and the guards did faithfully man their posts. Yet, Kale was amazed by the discipline level here. The caravan guards were fine soldiers, these guards were all hunched, stumbling around, probably drunk. Some were limping, dragging their feet, some moaned and some laughed. Utterly pathetic excuses for sentries. <BR> <BR>Kale shook his head and would think little more on the matter. He and Clymain began walking along the wall, hiding in what shadow there was. They stopped suddenly as the grate slowly lifted. <BR> <BR>Kale and Clymain plastered themselves against the wall, eyes fixed on the slowly rising bars. The grate was glowing slightly green, very dull color. The color was so light it was almost indistinguishable. Then, two men walked out of the pit on a flight of side stairs Kale never noticed before. The men were very tall and thin, and their faces were each very pale. They wore long, black robes with bright red collars that flared up from behind their heads. Each had a staff, a long, ebony shaft affixed with a jewel in the top. One jewel was green, while the other man&#39;s was purple. The green jewel pulsed slightly right now. Kale couldn&#39;t tell much more detail at this distance. <BR> <BR>The two men conversed slightly in front of the grate. The green aura started to fade, and the bars slowly returned to their normal position. The two men walked slowly towards the throne room, and entered the massive doors. <BR> <BR>&#34;Clymain, did you see that?&#34; Kale whispered to his partner. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m not sure...&#34; Clymain stated lightly. <BR> <BR>They heard the voice again, this time, it wasn&#39;t like a scream or a roar. More like a moan, a saddened sound of despair. Kale stared at the grate untrustingly, then rolled his view over to Kale. <BR> <BR>&#34;Maybe its in pain, Kale. Maybe they did capture something and put it in that pit.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale stared at the bars with an innate fear of the unknown. His heart shifted slightly as Clymain spoke again. <BR> <BR>&#34;Maybe we should let it out, or at least put it out of its misery.&#34; Clymain returned his view to the pit, &#34;I&#39;d rather not know what those mad men intend to do to it.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale said nothing, but knew if he was in their, he&#39;d want to be out or dead compared to that fate as well. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok, but only for a shirt while, we HAVE to get out of here tonight.&#34; Kale stammered as he looked to his comrade, &#34;How do we get in it?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll lift the grate, &#34; Clymain said, pointing his finger to the hole, &#34;You climb in, hold the grate from under, and I&#39;ll climb in. We&#39;ll get out the same way.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale nodded, not liking the idea one bit. Clymain began slowly walking across the moon lit courtyard, Kale following close behind. <BR> <BR>As they reached the grate, Kale had to look at the guards once more. <BR> <BR>&#34;What kind of soldiers...nevermind.&#34; He thought. <BR> <BR>Clymain strained a bit, but lifted the bars high enough for Kale to lay down and roll in. Kale let out a yelp as he caught the edge of the pit, his feet not touching any ground. He shuffled his hands until he was at the stairs. He climbed on them and crouched his body, holding the metal up with his back. <BR> <BR>&#34;What a smell, rot, blah.&#34; Clymain stated in a disgusted fashion. <BR> <BR>Clymain rolled in a similar fashion, and almost fell in as well, hanging on the edge. Kale waited for Clymain to get on the stairs before setting down the grate, so he wouldn&#39;t smash his fingers. The duo slowly began heading down the stairs. <BR> <BR>The stairs ran along each wall in a large square. Clymain was in the lead, and Kale followed shortly behind. They could see a doorway at the bottom, much further down than they thought, and a purple light came from somewhere within. They heard the moan again, and stopped dead in their tracks. <BR> <BR>Clymain looked down the center of the hole, and could see bodies floating in something in front of the door, and said, &#34;I&#39;m not wading through that.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We&#39;ll see when we get there.&#34; Kale answered bluntly, none to pleased about being here in the first place. <BR> <BR>As they descended they finally reached the door. Luckily, the stairs ran down into a sidewalk around the pit. Their steps were still gushy, as the stone was wet with blood and other excretions, but it beat wading in the pool of decay. <BR> <BR>As Clymain reached the door, the moan sounded off again. Fairly load this time. The cracks of the door and the edges all had the purple light spewing forth. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well Kale, are you ready for this one?&#34; Clymain asked with a false smile and vague humor. <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t think either one of us will be ready for whatever is on the other side of this portal...&#34; Kale stated bluntly, grasping his axe and scythe, &#34;So lets just do it.&#34; <BR> <BR>Stay Tuned. Sorry for the cliffhanger. :P CHB
