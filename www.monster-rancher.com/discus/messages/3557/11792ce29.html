<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:Blackrazzorx@aol.com>BlackRazor</A></B> on <B>Tuesday, February 3, 2004 - 11:23 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 &#40;This ones shorter, but five will be nice and long. Enjoy. Comments appreciated.&#41; <BR> <BR>CHAPTER 4:Dire Magic <BR> <BR>&#34;...and that is my tale, the whole, grim truth of it Sir Knight.&#34; <BR> <BR>Pharis stood much like a statue as he listened to the dark tale, feeling a great swell of pity for the little Undine and her ordeal of the last day. A durahan had few ways to accurately express such emotion and so he opted to remain still, a cold, immutable presence glinting gently beneath the suns rays.  <BR> <BR>It had taken some coaxing to even get her to acknowledge him, so numb with fear and hurt. When the Azure warrior finally did get her to speak, she told him of how the humans had treated her. Oshin had refused to leave the side of her fallen trainer, but &#39;they&#39; would hear none of it. They took her and stuffed the already traumatized monster into a cage where she wouldn&#39;t interfer with their investigations. Pharis wondered if the humans treated their own kind with such disregard. <BR> <BR>&#34;My wings...&#34; Oshin whispered in a sad little voice, collapsing to her knees in the grass. &#34;Lillian... Why? I don&#39;t understand... I don&#39;t.&#34; <BR> <BR>She looked to him for explanation and the warrior gave none. His only visible reaction were mithril fingers tightening around the pommel of his blade. When no answer came, she broke down into sobs that shook her tiny frame. He could not bare to watch this much longer. She&#39;d broken down five times since in the last hour as it was. It wasn&#39;t that he was unsympathetic. Her trainer murdered, her wings lost. An Undine&#39;s wings were used for swimming as well as flying. She&#39;d never have the same about of control in the water, nor the air, forever a prisoner of the earth from this day forward. <BR> <BR>&#34;Enough.&#34; The harshness of his tone frightened her, and she looked up, hurriedly rubbing the tears from her eyes. &#34;I apologize, but as we stand here idle the murderers are free to run amok.&#34; <BR> <BR>He could already tell she wouldn&#39;t be much help in this matter. What was needed was a safe place to put her while he brought the savages to justice. It just so happened that he knew of just such a place... Someplace safe, but also a nexus of information even the F.I.M.B.A wouldn&#39;t be aware of. <BR> <BR>&#34;I do not know where these killers have run, but I know where to start... The M.L.M...&#34; The Knight couldn&#39;t help but notice a few odd looks from the human agents that were working nearby. Indeed, the M.L.M. was an organization that seemed he draw as many curses as praise. He could tell by the look she gave that Oshin had never heard of such a group, and was skeptical at best. &#34;We shall journey at once towards the nearest village of Thayvar. I know of one there that may be willing to part with the information we need.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I hope so...&#34; Oshin trembled, fighting very hard not to weep again and managing to win the battle this time. She looked more like a small, frightened child then a feared and respected warrioress, the Undine who had toppled a hundred opponents. <BR> <BR>&#34;Then we will leave at once.&#34; Pharis made a point of keeping his tone level and detached. It was best to keep her at arms length, especially when he planned to dump her at the nearest opportunity. Despite himself, Pharis regretted the thought as soon as it crossed his mind. He was torn between the relentless hunt for justice and the safety and protection of one who was now alone. <BR> <BR>The two departed shortly afterward, going on foot as Pharis had little gold, and they might well need it. Information was never free, and rarely cheap. Side by side they walked, hours passing in a sort of uncomfortable silence. Pharis stubbornly trying to avoid even the slightest of emotional attachments, and so made no move to comfort the grieving Undine. Oshin herself was silent, perhaps a little pale in the face, as cold as if she had died alongside her trainer, numb to all the world.  <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Upon the road to Thayvar morning was left behind long ago, leaving the warm afternoon sun beyond. The sky was a perfect cerulean blue and the air was filled the sweet scents of flowers blooming late across the plains. It was a gorgeous, gorgeous day. The kind that begged one to frolic and enjoy life. <BR> <BR>Oshin however, wished for rain. <BR> <BR>The beauty she saw all around her was an affront to her grief. She felt oddly betrayed, as if the world should be grieving along with her and wasn&#39;t. It was certainly illogical to look up at a clear blue sky with something akin to hatred, but a grief stricken mind rarely follows patterns. It was more a jumbled mess of emotions, each one fighting for dominance at any one time, causing almost violent mood swings and sudden bouts of tears. She hated the way she felt, and so hated the world all the more. <BR> <BR>The occasional wagon passed them with warmest regards and condolences, but their smiles were fake and their promises hollow. As if they really cared. The nerve of them.. dropping off a few kind words to the poor, broken down pixie and then rushing off to their own cozy little lives. They didn&#39;t know... they didn&#39;t understand. <BR> <BR>Her traveling partner wasn&#39;t making matters much better. At first she had been enthralled by the mere sight of such an impressive monster. It was enough, for a few moments, to break her out of some of the depression that held her. That is, until she learned his true nature. Every fiber of her being ached for some tiny measure of comfort, even a little pat on the shoulder and a promise that everything would work out, anything. Instead the cold, unfeeling brute kept her at a distance, making her feel like an unwanted burden. <BR> <BR>&#34;There, ahead...&#34; A strong, stern voice at her side spoke up, a blue gauntlet pointing to a small town that had appeared on the horizon. Oshin hadn&#39;t even noticed that they were so close now to their destination. &#34;There it is, Thayvar.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You haven&#39;t told me....&#34; She managed to mutter, sounding just slightly bitter despite herself. It was a strange sound to hear coming from the honey voiced Undine. &#34;Who &#39;are&#39; the M.L.M?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t heard of them. The Monster Liberation Movement. They&#39;re activists who believe that the rights of monsters are outdated and deny us our freedom as thinking creatures.&#34; He spoke proudly of the group, and it was clear he thought their cause one worthwhile. &#34;They have an honorable goal.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;The humans can&#39;t be happy about that...&#34; She mumbled in response, barely audible. She couldn&#39;t decide if she cared or not about this conversation. <BR> <BR>&#34;Actually the group has survived thanks to it&#39;s human supporters. It&#39;s even rumored that certain members of the committee support the M.L.M, even if they cannot say publicly. They are a peaceful group, and with enough public support they may be the heralds of change one day.&#34; He sounded hopeful. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah...sure...&#34; The little Undine shrugged and trudged on a little ahead of him. <BR> <BR>&#34;Such a lovely conversational partner you are. I was merely answering your question.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t talk to me.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Look, It is not my wish to upset you further, but one must be strong in situations like this. If you give in to grief...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Leave me alone!&#34; <BR> <BR>The Knight shook his head once, but said nothing else beyond, &#34;As you wish.&#34;  <BR> <BR>There would be no more words between the two for some time. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Thayvar wasn&#39;t a particularly popular or well known place, thanks to it&#39;s lack of a coliseum or any other sort of tournament functions. There wasn&#39;t even a mudpit in which too monsters could do battle, and the citizens prided themselves on staying clear of such barbaric spectacles. This meant there were rarely combat worthy monsters, or even humans for that matter, in the village.  <BR> <BR>It was a beacon to all manner of scum, including the GodsHand Marauders. <BR> <BR>Even now a few of them stood atop a hilly ridge, looking down upon the settlement with greed and bloodlust in their hearts. They were a legion of Magic&#39;s who delighted in destruction and looting, always killing with nothing except their own bare hands. Thanks to the raving of a charismatic, though insane leader, the Magic&#39;s believed that their hands, able to take life so effortlessly, made them akin to the Gods, above all law human or otherwise. They captured Dino&#39;s and Zuums who they trained into savages and terrorized the countryside.  <BR> <BR>Thus far, no group had been able to stop then. <BR> <BR>They struck fast, hard and then faded away, always attacking poorly defended settlements and villages. They were smart never to attack any area that could defend against their skill and numbers. Thayvar would be next. <BR> <BR>&#34;The village is ripe for the taking.&#34; One of the scouts spoke. He was of average height for one of his kind, arms and chest heavily tattooed with emerald serpents. They spiraled around his muscular arms, linked together as they devoured each others tails. <BR> <BR>&#34;Gather our brothers, Rin. We strike with the rise of the full moon.&#34; Replied the huge Magic to his right. He was likewise tattooed, though his frame much larger. Around his throat hung a necklace of human finger bones and he wore armor wrought from the bones of a dragon. &#34;Our Master wishes blood spilled this night, and so it shall be. The hand of the gods will fall!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;As you wish Lord Gron&#39;Nu.&#34; He bowed low and sped off beneath the setting sun, ensured that the fate of Thayvar had been sealed.  <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Thayvar was a simple place to be certain, a quant little town that seemed to mark the land where the plains became hills. Almost every member of the small community knew the other and the single most popular gathering spot was the local tavern. Very few monsters walked the stone pathways and tended gardens, but those that did were treated with an unusual amount of respect. No strange looks, nor expectations that a human Master be with them at all times. Pharis didn&#39;t think he could ever live without the thrill of battle, but if he was ever to hang up his sword and try for a life of peace, he wouldn&#39;t mind living here. <BR> <BR>Oshin walked along at his side, still solemn, still silent. She gave passing glances to the stone houses around them, but little more. Even the joyful sight of a child playing with a little tiger cub in his yard did could not bring her to smile.  <BR> <BR>Personally, it was beginning to get on his nerves... <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, here we are.&#34; Finally they arrived at Thayvar&#39;s famed tavern, a comfortable spot and the place Pharis could usually find his contact to the M.L.M. Any place else might have thought it strange that a pair of unsupervised monsters were just waltzing into a tavern, but all Pharis found were a few greetings and pleasant nods as the villagers left them to their business. The tender was serving drinks and speaking in jovial tones with the customers, whom he&#39;d probably known for many years. People drank and sang and played pool in the corner, but no sign of his contact.  <BR> <BR>&#34;We&#39;ll wait for my contact here.&#34; He noticed then that Oshin was looking even more depressed then before. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why...?&#34; She was tearing up again, little shoulders trembling as she fought against the swell of emotion. &#34;So you can pawn me off? Dump me somewhere out of the way? I know you don&#39;t want me around!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Please, not this again... Your grief will not bring the guilty to justice. What we need now is swift action and not-&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No...&#34;It wasn&#39;t a scream, but the sharp glare that came with it gave the Knight paused. He had never seen a look so utterly cold in his life. She angrily wiped the tears from her face. &#34;You didn&#39;t know Lillian... it wasn&#39;t your wings torn away. I have a thousand times more right to want revenge, and I don&#39;t need your help!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well you&#39;ve named but two so far...&#34; He could tell he&#39;d gone too far and regretted his words almost at once. Still, all this crying and such galled him so. Pharis tried to speak a word of apology but Oshin would hear none of it. Sobbing, she rushed out of the tavern.  <BR> <BR>Pharis felt truly bad about his insensitivity. He always was the impatient type, whether it was pursuing justice or in dealing with other monsters. His first impulse was to follow, but the Undine probably needed to be alone right now. Long minutes passed before a scream pierced the air and every one of the taverns patrons gave a start. That first cry was but one of many as panic gripped the village and the Azure Knight rushed forward to face whatever might be the cause. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#34;Archers! Open fire! Riders, move into the village. Pillage and burn!&#34; <BR> <BR>Gron&#39;Nu rallied the marauders beneath the banner of a golden fist, the hand of the divine. He sat atop his mount, an armored black Dino that stirred restlessly beneath him, hungry for the blood and flesh of human beings. Dozens of Magic&#39;s poured out of the hills, some rushing on foot, others riding Dino&#39;s and Zuums. The village resistance was no resistance at all as the human defenders where trampled by reptilian feet or broken by the trained hands of the Magic&#39;s. Streaks of flame shot across the night sky, causing embers to fall like rain amid the carnage. Men, women, children, the Marauders cared nothing for either, slaughtering at random and stealing what they could. <BR> <BR>It was all too easy. The men of the village at first tried to fight back with anything in reach, but it soon became clear they were overmatched. Was there nothing in this pathetic village that could test the mighty Gron&#39;Nu? He leapt from his mount, grabbing the head of a man who dared stand against him and crushing it like a melon. The corpse became food for the black Dino to feast upon. <BR> <BR>&#34;The tavern! converge on the tavern and kill all wi-&#34; <BR> <BR>The huge Magic never completed the sentence, his words trailing off as he saw something that could not be. A golden bolt of lightening streaking through the air, as straight and true as an arrow. Only his great combat experience allowed for Gron to leap aside, and as the bolt cut deep into the heart of his mount, he realized what it was. <BR> <BR>A sword. <BR> <BR>&#34;You picked the wrong village to ransack! How could you do this!?&#34; The voice was one of righteous anger as the Herme&#39;s stepped forth from the black cloud of smoke. A quick gesture of his wrist, and the sword returned obediently to his hand. &#34;The only Justice for your kind would be your deaths, and that is what I seek!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Big words...but you are but one. Kill him!&#34; <BR> <BR>Five Magic&#39;s leapt at the Azure warrior, the first falling right into the path of his blade as it sliced open his stomach and freed his intestines. The second tripped over the corpse, falling face first onto the ground. The Herme&#39;s stomped his mithril foot into the fallen magic&#39;s spine, grinding the heel even as his shield warded off punches and kicks from the remaining three. <BR> <BR>Another Magic attacked with a spinning kick, but the warrior was more nimble then he appeared, dodging the kick with a hop backward. The Magic left his back exposed for a spit second as he over extended himself, more then enough time for Pharis to swipe the razor edge of his sword down the creatures spine. The final pair rushed headlong, but promptly found their torso&#39;s severed from their waists. <BR> <BR>Through the brief, though bloody conflict Gron&#39;Nu watched, rather impressed. He raised a hand when other Magic&#39;s and Dino&#39;s threatened to attack. <BR> <BR>&#34;No! This one is mine...&#34;

 Ooooh. What are Magic&#39;s again? MR1 genie guys? Nice story, getting inside everyone&#39;s head like that. A little confusing about M.L.M. though...Are they for or against monsters?

 I knew I forget something. Magic&#39;s only appeared in MR1 and Pure breeds look almost identical to humans, actually. They look similar to bald monks, I&#39;ve always thought.

 Magic = MR1 Bajarl <BR> <BR>And the spot he was speaking of BR, was a slip in thought process: <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t heard of them. The Monster Liberation Movement. They&#39;re activists who believe that the rights of monsters are outdated and deny us our freedom as thinking creatures.&#34; He spoke proudly of the group, and it was clear he thought their cause one worthwhile. &#34;They have an honorable goal.&#34; <BR> <BR>You were actually talking about the MLM, but the transition to describing the &#39;rights of monsters&#39; sounded like you were still speaking of the MLM. I myself, had to stop and read that part a total of four times, before I understood. <BR> <BR>With only one bump, this chapter securely helped to press a long and glorious road for your new epic. Fear the return of the Black Razor!

 By the way, I was living &#39;back in the day&#39; early in this story. I had been thinking, &#34;Undines don&#39;t have wings!&#34; <BR> <BR>However, I took a look at the MR4 Pixies, and realized my fumble. :P
