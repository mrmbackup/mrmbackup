 Yes I know it&#39;s been a while and this is a short chapter.  Like I&#39;ve said before I&#39;ve been busy, busy with my other fan fics.  I&#39;m working on 3 others to be exact.  None are MR related.  But I&#39;ll still be working on this one so don&#39;t worry.  Once I get most things worked out you&#39;ll see more chapters of Story of Wes.  Anyways here&#39;s chapter 11. <BR> <BR>Until next time... C&#39;ya! <BR> <BR>Chapter 11: The Marksmen  <BR> <BR>	Several days ago… in an unknown location… <BR>	“I want them dead.  I will not accept failure.  Do you understand?” the voice rang through out the darkened area.  A sole figure bowed humbly on the floor in the center of the only light in the place.  His whole front was shaded from the light above.  All that was clear was the loose black shirt he wore and his long black hair that was pulled back into a long ponytail.   <BR>	“Yes Master Abbadon.  Geete and Rancher shall be as good as dead, I can promise you that.”    <BR> <BR> <BR>It had been two days since the group’s incident with Hagar.  Killa Kan had almost completely repaired and upgraded himself using Hagar’s remains.  They were all well rested and fed.  But until Killa Kan was sure he was in perfect condition they weren’t going to leave.   <BR> <BR>“Well it certainly is good to see everyone well again,” Wes said as he entered the room they were staying in. <BR>“Well yeah.  I’m just glad to still be alive,” Rancher replied, acting as if they didn’t have to worry about anything they might encounter. <BR>“Yeah so why are we going to this Midnight Valley place anyway?” Wes asked. <BR>“I told you before you’ll see when we get there,” Rancher snapped. <BR>“Geez sorry for asking.” <BR> <BR>Outside an old covered wagon pulled into town.  It was brown with a very dull red colored covering.  On the side in even duller letters was written a single word “DRAGON”.   <BR> <BR>The coach driver was a bald and wiry old man dressed in a nice suit.  He was though very healthy looking despite how one could describe him.   <BR> <BR>“We’re here.  Be sure to be successful and the money is guaranteed.  Failure is not acceptable.  Am I clear?” the old man said in a soft but harsh voice. <BR> <BR>Inside the covered wagon sat the figure from before.  No light was shining into the wagon.  All that was visible was a shaded form of his face.  His eyes mostly caught what light was there. <BR> <BR>“Understood,” was all the figure said.  A smile crossed his face and he lifted one of his six-shooters to his face.  The little bit of light caught the barrel of the six-shooter. <BR> <BR>It was getting around sundown.  Rancher just headed out of the door to get the group some dinner when he stopped.  No one was outside, except for one person.   <BR>It was a man wearing a loose black shirt.  Two ammo straps hung around the shirt and black pants were held by a leather belt.  Two six-shooters rested in each hand.   <BR> <BR>The man’s face had signs of having not been shaven for a while.  His long black hair fell onto his back from underneath a black hat.   <BR> <BR>“Mannen,” Rancher said, already reaching for his daggers. <BR>“That’s right.  How long has it been since your part in the Weapons building back when you were a…” Mannen was cut off by Rancher. <BR>“Shut up!” Rancher shouted, his face showed a rage that he could hardly hold. <BR>“That’s right I forgot.  Your suppose to be a good guy now,” Mannen said with a chuckle. <BR>“So what is it then?  You want to go down fighting or should you just save me the trouble and I’ll execute you now,” the gunfighter added. <BR>“If you think I’m going to let Dragon get away with this then you’re out of your mind,” Rancher exclaimed. <BR> <BR>“Did you want to get some of your friends to help you?  I’m giving you this one and only chance,” Mannen said pointing to the building that Rancher had just walked out of. <BR>“I can handle this myself,” Rancher said as he pulled free his daggers and extended the blades of them. <BR>“Fine then.  On behalf of the Holy Shrine of Draco himself… I hereby now sign your death note,” Mannen said as he pulled free a rolled scroll and signed his Rancher’s name on it. <BR>“So you like to keep track of who you kill?  Your sick,” Rancher said as Mannen put back the scroll. <BR>“Heh and you were no different then me back then.  Anyway enough of this talk.  Let’s get going… draw!” Mannen said pulling free both of his guns and already pumping out bullets. <BR> <BR>Rancher tumbled to his side avoiding the salvo.  He got up and continued his movement going right.  He’d have to wait for some kind of delay, or tell Mannen had to reload. <BR> <BR>Rancher shifted forward and began to head back toward Mannen.  Mannen took time to pump off another few shots.  Rancher deflected them with his knives and closed in, pulling his one of his blades down in an attempt to slash open Mannen’s face.   <BR> <BR>Mannen shifted to his side and kicked Rancher in the stomach.  Then he quickly followed it up by shooting him in the shoulder.  Rancher hit the ground with a loud thump.  He left shoulder was bleeding and he gripped it with his right hand, dropping both of his blades.   <BR> <BR>“It seems as if you’ve lost your will to kill,” Mannen said as he lowered his smoking gun in his left hand. <BR> <BR>“Go ahead and kill me, if I die I want to die by someone I used to consider a friend,” Rancher said gritting his teeth. <BR> <BR>“Your pathetic.  You hardly lasted a minute,” Mannen said as he used his right foot to roll Rancher onto his back.  He then jammed the barrel of his right gun into Rancher’s chest.   <BR> <BR>“All I have to do now is get rid of that piece of trash, then I can enjoy my prize money,” Mannen said with a smile. <BR> <BR>Rancher gave a swift kick at the back of Mannen’s knee causing him to fall, then he quickly took up both knives.  Manned steadied himself to see Rancher fleeing into one of the nearby buildings. <BR> <BR>“Come back here and fight me Rancher!” Mannen yelled as he popped off a few shots.  Rancher lowered himself to avoid the shots and dashed into the door. <BR> <BR>“Hey what’s going on out here?” Wes said as he exited the door from the inn. <BR> <BR>Mannen turned around to see the boy, he smiled the idea he just got. <BR>Wes gave him a confused look, then began to back away as he realized what’s happening.  <BR> <BR>“Whew that was close,” Rancher said as he looked about the place he was in.  It was an old abandoned storage area.  Several dust covered boxes resided in the corner of one wall.  Three boarded up windows took position on each wall.  Making nine in all.  One side being shared with the building next door meant that there wouldn’t be a window there for obvious reasons. <BR> <BR>“Were is he gonna attack from?” Rancher asked as he looked about the area.   <BR> <BR>There was a sudden bang, and several wood chips flew everywhere.  The boards were blown to bits and bullets zipped toward Rancher. <BR> <BR>Rancher let out aloud cry as he hit the floor to avoid the bullets. <BR> <BR>“Come on out or the kid gets it!” Mannen yelled. <BR>“Wes?” Rancher shouted. <BR>“Yeah, hi, sorry,” Rancher heard Wes cry back apologetically. <BR>“Hang on, I’ll get you out of this!” Rancher yelled. <BR>“Come out with your hands up!” Mannen shouted. <BR> <BR>Rancher did that… he walked out the front door with both of his hands above his head.  Mannen held Wes in front of him like a shield, one gun held to the kid’s head, the other gun pointed at Rancher. <BR> <BR>“Good, now die!” Mannen said popping off several shots toward Rancher’s direction.   <BR> <BR>Rancher somersaulted to his left throwing both of his knives from inside his sleeves.  One knife cut across Mannen’s left hand… the other went into his left shoulder.   <BR> <BR>Mannen dropped back to the ground ripping the knife from his shoulder and dropping his left gun.  Wes ran back a ways to make sure he didn’t get caught like that again. <BR> <BR>Rancher got himself upright again.  Mannen began shooting randomly at Rancher.  Rancher dived forward and grabbed one of his knives.  Then he continued forward until he was right on top of Mannen.  His knife was lifted up and ready… though he was right in front of Mannen’s barrel of his right gun. <BR> <BR>“So it’s come to this?” Mannen said between panting. <BR>“Heh… and you thought it’d be easy,” Rancher said, panting as well. <BR> <BR>Sweat dripped down both of their faces. <BR> <BR>“Wes go back to the room and stay there.  This is between Mannen and I,” Rancher ordered. <BR> <BR>Wes listened and went back.  The two combatants never took their eyes off each other.   <BR> <BR>Mannen grabbed his other gun in his left and wildly shot forward.  Rancher rolled backward.  Mannen and Rancher both got up at the same time.  Mannen shot off more times.  Rancher deflected them with his knives and charged forward.   <BR> <BR>Mannen began to back pedal while shooting off a few more times.  He needed to reload his left gun, so he began to do that one handed while getting off a couple more shots with the other. <BR> <BR>Many of the bullets missed Rancher.  One zipped across his cheek.  He cursed silently as he felt his blood flow down his face.   <BR>      <BR>Rancher got no more then a few feet away from Mannen before Mannen finally finished reloading his other gun.  He shot a few times trying to get Rancher before he could use his knives.   <BR> <BR>It was useless, most of the shots went stray as he panicked.  Rancher jammed his right knife into Mannen’s left arm and then he used his other knife to slash at the ammo belts, causing them to fall to the ground with a heavy thud. <BR> <BR>“Get it up it’s over,” Rancher said as he kicked Mannen to the ground. <BR> <BR>Mannen dropped his left gun and lowered his other.  His eyes looked watery, almost like he was going to cry. <BR> <BR>“Mannen.  Help us.  We won’t have to worry about Abbadon.  You’ll be free as long as you help us.  It’s for the better of mankind,” Rancher said putting away one of his knives and extending his hand. <BR> <BR>“Failure… is not accepted,” Mannen said, lifting his right gun to his temple, cocking the gun. <BR>“Mannen no!” Rancher shouted. <BR> <BR>The last gunshot echoed through the town.  It was over.   <BR> <BR>About an hour later, Rancher entered the inn room.  He was wearing the ammo belts over his shoulders and held Mannen’s guns, one in each hand. <BR> <BR>“What happened to…” Wes began, a look of worry held. <BR>“He’s gone,” Rancher said, slowly walking toward a chair. <BR>“I buried him a little ways outside of town,” Rancher added.  Rancher looked like he was almost about to cry.  He was bloody and dusty and worn.  He looked ten years older then he actually was.  He looked as if he couldn’t go on, as if he couldn’t take another day of the hell that the mysterious enemy only known as Dragon has given them. <BR>    <BR> <BR>Is this what his whole life is about?  Killing and getting people killed?  He had to try to coop for all of the things he’d done wrong in life.  Somehow, somewhere, sometime, he had to face Abbadon.  He had to... even if it meant giving up everything he had.  The Cathedral of the Dragon is his destiny.  The downfall of Dragon is his reason.  He had to make it.  Soon... soon enough… he’ll be there. <BR> <BR>-Nicholas D. Wolfwood-

 Um... I wasn&#39;t too sure where I can post this question so I&#39;ll just post it under here. <BR> <BR>Ahem... seeing that it takes me a while to pump out another chapter of Story of Wes how would you peoples like me to post my other non-Monster Rancher related fan fics.  I must tell you though that the one I&#39;d be willing to post up is based off the Sonic Comics and fan fics by Mr. Kevin Lu.  This one is updated daily with new chapters and the only problem it may have is some mild language. <BR> <BR>Will determining on the responses I get I&#39;ll post it up or not. <BR> <BR>Until next time... C&#39;ya! <BR> <BR>-Nicholas D. Wolfwood-

 Probably better to stick with the MR-related fiction. We&#39;re trying to conserve space for MR3.

 Yes Lisa, but would it be agreeable to place links to other fiction sites in the library? I&#39;m not a computer buff, nor know how to make a link. If a link would take up too much space, I understand and request an e-mail of the site from Wolfwood. If it is not to much of a hassle, let me know.

 Excellent work Wolfwood.  I enjoyed this epic very much, especially since I had both a Gobi and an equally destructive Renocraft in my HOF.  Keep it up!
