 It was august 22. Cecil had just aced his personality test. The chairman came out and introduced him to her assistant after giving him the assistant&#39;s card. It read&#34;IMA Trainer Assistant 10114 <BR>Coltia <BR>The EXam Pass Date-3/24/1000 <BR>The Exam Score-92/100 <BR>Comment-A little bit hasty&#34;. When she came out she was happy that she got to work with a cute boy. The chairman found a ranch. They went to the shrine.The Priestess introduced herself as Chaille. He handed her the only Saucer Stone he had. He put it into a slot and yelled&#34;UNLOCK&#34; Out of the disc came out a Kasumi. He did the same to a Saucer Stone Coltia gave him. It released a Hopper. They went to the ranch. After a few years of training, Pabs came along and warned the duo about the 2-continent meet. They entered Hopper into the elimination for rank D, which he won. When they went for the meet, Colt saw an old friend named Holly. Hopper went up to her, nuzzled her, upon which she petted him, then returned to Cecil. Upon winning the battle with a few Jump Blows, the meet went into standard play. The rest of the team won. The judge declared Team IMa the winner, and Cecil recieves a congratulations hug from Clt and from Kasumi, and a kiss from Kasumi. Hopper digs up a hot spring, Colt gets in her swimsuit and jumps in, something Cecil hadn&#39;t seen her do in the last 5 years. 4 years later, Hopper dies. Colt&#39;s aunt, Verde, came to the funeral, as well as the tournament announcer. Colt didn&#39;t wear a suit. She wore a red dress. Even Kasumi attends, in a dress Verde made especialy for her.
