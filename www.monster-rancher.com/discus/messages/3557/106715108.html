 A long trek back up the mountain had stripped the bottom of his feet of skin. After a few hours of travel, each footprint bore a pool of blood.  <BR>     This was always the hardest part. Nearing the last ledge before the top, there was no light. Pitch darkness, and a wolf edging through it. A long tunnel stretched from the ledge, into the mountain and up to the top, where he made his life. <BR>There were a few monsters that used to live here, But he had long since destoyed them. And so, into the darkness. <BR>   Another hour of travel and he emerged at the top of the mountain, the biting wind clawing at a new wound and a broken paw. He had broken many limbs before, nearly all of them healing improperly. But it was irrelevant. <BR>His living area was a small mound of furs, under a rock jutting out of the cliff, where the tunnel opened into the top of the mountain.    <BR>   He went to the ledge across from his &#34;bed&#34;.  He remembers the first time he saw this view. This view of civilization. It was an improper, informal distraction. As he gazed  downward onto the cities and forests that were warm and prosperous, he never really would remember what they were like. He remembered a few things of that world, the pain, the hunger, the torment, but mostly the strength. The power of it. In that would he had been respected, he knew it, but also feared. He ended the train of thought. It was so long ago. Or maybe it wasn&#39;t. he didnt know. But why didn&#39;t he know.... He was starting to think about it again. <BR>    He sat in quiet, thinking nothing. He must have fallen asleep there, on that edge , looking down, for when he woke up his fur was covered in frost, and one of his teeth had cracked in half. Growling, he ate the half of the fang that lay near his mouth.  <BR>Anger. His inside felt like they were turning out. He had forgotten to bring the deers fur up. <BR>This meant another day of going down the mountain only to come back up. And so in his anger he ran, eyes again glowing golden, down the tunnel. Rock flashed past him, he smashed his shoulder up against a boulder as he  exited the tunnel, leaping off the ledge. He landed improperly on the ground, His already fractured shoulder now breaking. <BR>Pain, frustration and strength to endure all rolled into one. <BR> <BR>The wind doesnt cry! <BR> <BR>As he thought this, the wind blew hard, and he fell over, on his side. Sadness... <BR>He cried. <BR>The wind doesn&#39;t cry. <BR>The wind doesnt cry! <BR>He was so sick, so tired, so broken! <BR>So lonely! <BR>He remembered this happened once before. Exactly like this. And suddenly, he remembered why. Never before had he remembered why. <BR>Excitement. <BR>He remembered a large room, with no roof, it was so big, with a platform in the middle. Someone was there.  He had got onto the platform, and then the somene had started to hurt him. <BR>Hurting and hurting, punching him! <BR>He didnt understand these memories. Then he remembered hurting it back. <BR>He bit and fought it, but it beat him back again. Then, burning. It burned! <BR>Cheering. Voices? <BR>And someone yelling. <BR>At him. He turned to look, and the someone lunged at his shoulder. Pain seared through him as he heard a sickening crack followed by the warm feeling of blood flowing. A laugh, and he fell. Shock. <BR>His back stiffened, and the cheering stopped. <BR>He didnt understand. Some thing touched him and his body convulsed for a second. Useless, he heard it. Useless. Then he was here. But the memory wasn&#39;t over. The memory showed him here, hurt, bleeding, dying, at the foot of the mountain. And then he got up, he didnt know if the memory was over, maybe it was more like a flashback, because he could feel the cold under his paws. He saw someone, tall above him, saying something. He attacked that person. He killed him. And a terrible sorrow overtook him. Just like with the deer.  <BR>    He cried then. As he cried now. <BR>then the memory was over, and he got up. He loked up at the mountain, and he moved backward, away from it. Another memory. &#34;Go up, Roji.&#34; <BR>The memory ended. <BR>Confused, hurt and sad, he turned and limped quickly into the forest. <BR>He came, after a long time of moving, to warmth. Such an unfamiliar feeling. There was tall stone infront of him, and he lay against it, and he slept. <BR> <BR> <BR>---------------------------------- <BR>Umm I realize that this chapter is kinda confusing, but I felt this necassary in order to express what he is like.

 I like it, myself. Just expressing the feelings inside of him, the torrent, the flood. <BR> <BR>I really like the way you write, the style that is. I hope that your skill for plot can keep up. :P

 so far, it&#39;s more of a &#34;prose poem&#34; than a story...but you&#39;ve caught my interest.
