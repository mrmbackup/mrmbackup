 Kale&#39;s gaze drifted ever slowly as his eyes opened. After he blacked out, he fancied himself lucky for no dreams, no nightmares after his ordeal. Just dark. His vision blurry, he realized he was on his back now, and it was day. So he assumed, unless it was from some king of lighting in the room. <BR> <BR>A room? <BR> <BR>Kale blinked uncertainly a bit, then tried to sit up. This pain was rather sharp, and he instantly dismissed the notion of rising for now. He glanced about the room uneasily as his sight began to clear. <BR> <BR>The walls and roof were made of what seemed like bamboo, and he could see light streaming through the cracks. Obviously it was day. A few birds chirped lightly as he looked over to a little table sitting beside the door. On it were several types of flowers, a few bottles of assorted liquids, and what looked like extra bandages. A single stool sat by the head of the bed, with a silver bowl and a wash clothe within. <BR> <BR>Kale looked at himself lastly. His torso was almost completely bandaged, and his leg and shoulder had their treatment as well. His entire body was sore, that battle taxed him thoroughly. <BR> <BR>Clymain. <BR> <BR>The thought occurred just as quickly as that, just the name. Then came faces, and pictures. Clymain&#39;s body being slowly lifted into the air, the grimace on his face as the gears turned, the look of shock that rode his once smiling persona into the wall, and the gaze that was across his eyes in death. <BR> <BR>Kale closed his eyes, and almost on cue, the door opened. Kale looked at the doorway, not knowing if it was the Baron&#39;s men, not caring. The light poured in through the door, and around the figure. To his surprise, a womanly shape walked in. <BR> <BR>&#34;Where am I?&#34; Kale fired before any introductions could be made. Kale doubted she even noticed he was awake before he asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;Safe. Safer than that wretched castle by far.&#34; The woman spoke clearly and simply as she materialized from the blinding light. <BR> <BR>Kale&#39;s jaw slacked slightly at the overall beauty of this woman. She stood slightly shorter than he did. Kale assumed anyway, being down. She had short, brunette hair, ending just above the neck. It was styled almost resembling a helmet, and the front edges came to sharp points. In between these ends, was one of the most gorgeous faces Kale had ever seen. Crystal green eyes shot out from a defined face, edged to a perfection any artist would envy. A light, yet toned frame accompanied the smile that graced her. Kale could see her obvious muscle, despite how graceful and unthreatening she tried to appear. <BR> <BR>&#34;How...did I get here?&#34; Kale asked, still slightly dumbfounded by the beauty. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, lets just say you found us.&#34; She spoke with a slight hint of humor. <BR> <BR>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Kale stammered. <BR> <BR>&#34;You attacked us. We almost killed you at first,&#34; she spoke as she poured the liquids from one of the bottles into a glass, &#34;Then I happened to notice how beat up you were. I was probably the only thing that saved you from Sigel.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sigel?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;My brother.&#34; She said as she slid a hand behind Kale&#39;s head, lifting ever so gently, &#34;Drink.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale complied as much as he could with the angel&#39;s request. He coughed lightly as some of the fluid attempted to go down the wrong pipe. <BR> <BR>As she guided his head slowly back down to the pillow, Kale asked, &#34;Who are you then?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You first.&#34; She smiled lightly as she moved the bowl to the floor and sat on the stool. She took the clothe in her hand and squeezed most of the liquid from it. <BR> <BR>Kale blinked for a second, slightly off guard by this counter request. He shook the dumbfounded grin from his face and replied simply, &#34;Kale.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;My name is Paige.&#34; She said carefully dabbing the wet clothe on Kale&#39;s forehead. <BR> <BR>Kale smiled stupidly, why he was so pleased with the name of this goddess, he wasn&#39;t sure. Slowly, his smile faded again at the remembrance of Clymain. <BR> <BR>&#34;I would ask what happened to you, but whatever horrors you saw inside that castle must have been terrible.&#34; Paige spoke softly. <BR> <BR>&#34;How&#39;d you know I was in that castle?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sigel and Gerron backtracked your footsteps. They didn&#39;t make it all the way to the castle, those undead flunkies were already looking for something. Probably you.&#34; Paige said as she dabbed the clothe in the bowl, repeating the process. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, it was me.&#34; Kale stated bluntly, &#34;My best friend is still there.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Was he captured?&#34; She asked, almost reserved about asking. <BR> <BR>&#34;No, luckily he died. Compared to being captured that is.&#34; Kale said calmly as he attempted to stare a hole through the roof. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Kale.&#34; She said lightly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Paige?&#34; <BR> <BR>The unknown voice was masculine, yet tried to hold a peaceful tone to it, as if only to get someone&#39;s attention without disturbing anyone else. Paige turned her head slowly to the door as a shadow stuck only its top half into the doorway. <BR> <BR>&#34;Its fine, Gerron, he&#39;s awake.&#34; She must always speak with that melting smile, Kale thought. <BR> <BR>The form emerged from the lighted background exactly as Paige had. The final product was obviously different. This man was no giant, only slightly taller than Paige. His bushy, dark brown hair ran into sideburns that continued to his jawbone, in which they ran forward and up into a connecting mustache. His eyes were a dark brown color, and his face was very rugged. His leather armor was so tight it seemed like a part of him. A standard long sword gripped his sword belt firmly. The man crossed his arms over his large chest, his gloved hands seemed as massive as his arms. He gazed down at Kale curiously. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well well, good morning. Whatever you did sure had the Baron&#39;s troops up all night.&#34; He chuckled slightly, &#34;They&#39;re still out, tireless dead.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Gerron, this is Kale. Kale, Gerron.&#34; Paige spoke with slight hand gestures and that beaming smile. <BR> <BR>&#34;A pleasure.&#34; Kale stated blankly, not sure of how to perceive this man. <BR> <BR>&#34;Quite.&#34; Gerron stated back with the same sharpness, his eyes narrowed slightly hearing Kale&#39;s name. <BR> <BR>&#34;What was your business with the Baron anyway?&#34; A new voice entered the room. <BR> <BR>Another male, standing in the doorway, leaned against the frame. This shadow was a bit easier to see after Kale&#39;s vision was adjusted to the piercing light. Short, brown hair, cut in a military fashion. his nose stood out slightly more than the rest of his features, only competing with his eyes for the most dominant facial feature. His eyes were dark blue. His frame was slightly larger than Gerron&#39;s. He too, had a standard long sword strapped to his hip. His right leg crossed his left as he stood in the door, eyes fixed on Kale, waiting for his answer. <BR> <BR>&#34;Who is this?&#34; Kale asked Paige instead of asking the man directly. <BR> <BR>&#34;This is Sigel, my brother. Sigel, this is Kale.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I know.&#34; Sigel interjected rudely, &#34;I still want to know what business you had with the Baron, or might still have.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh yes.&#34; Kale strained between clinched teeth as he managed to rise to a sitting position, probably Paige&#39;s presence was enough to boost his strength. Kale spoke again once he was all the way up, &#34;I do have pressing business with Baron Perenolde once I&#39;m able to go see him again.&#34; <BR> <BR>The figure uncrossed his legs and quickly strode into the room, his eyes fixated on Kale as if with hatred, &#34;What business?&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale moved his legs off the bed, letting them hang, not sure if he wanted to try and stand or not. Paige placed a hand on his back and the second one lightly his chest as he swung his legs off, supporting his weight in case he fell back or forward. Kale slowly tilted his head so his gaze met Sigel&#39;s before saying, &#34;I&#39;m going to kill him.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Ha! You kill the Baron? Is that why you ran from him yesterday?&#34; Sigel spoke sarcastically, almost as if trying to taunt him into doing something. <BR> <BR>Kale&#39;s slight smirk faded, anger pulling at his nerves, but not enough for him to loose control. He spoke slowly looking back to Paige&#39;s beauty before saying, &#34;With Clymain dead, I owe the Baron one.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Was that his name?&#34; Sigel asked coldly, &#34;What about my friends?&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale gazed at him past clinched teeth as the tensions began to rise. Before Kale could let his mouth get the better of him, Paige interjected. <BR> <BR>&#34;Enough, Sigel. They were apparently tricked.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Please Paige, don&#39;t stick up for these filthy dogs.&#34; He started out the door before turning to add, &#34;It is truly a shame your friend is dead, I was looking forward to killing him. However, since he didn&#39;t survive, I&#39;ll assume he was a worthless opponent anyway.&#34; <BR> <BR>As the shadow began to merge with the light, Kale found himself in the door suddenly. Without thought and despite the pain, he was sprinting. Lowering his head, he tackled the shadow in the mid back. Kale rolled over Sigel to find himself falling. As the light faded, Kale grasped a bar of some kind, and dangled from it. <BR> <BR>Kale glanced down to see roughly a 20 foot drop from the balcony to the earthen floor. A forest with massive trees surrounded him. A village had been incorporated into this area. Some buildings were suspended in the trees, attached to massive trunks. Some of the huts and a few of the larger buildings were on the ground. Villagers continued about their many chores, though some had stopped now to watch the dangling man. <BR> <BR>Kale grasped the pole with his other hand and, fighting past the pain, threw one foot on the edge of the platform. As he slowly crawled up and rolled onto his back, he heard a sword unsheathe. He glanced up to see Sigel arching his arm back, preparing to impale Kale on his long sword. <BR> <BR>As the sword whistled toward him, Kale kicked up and away, catching the sword as it fell. Sigel stumbled as the blade shot between two parts of the platform. Kale got to his feet in his rage, kicking the sword at the hilt. The blade snapped with a sharp chime and Sigel stumbled back a bit ignorantly. He gazed down at the hilt of his once fine blade, only a fraction of the sword was still attached. <BR> <BR>Kale took a step toward him, but before he could follow up, two arms were around him in a vice lock. The pain was too much as Kale screamed and felt his knees go limp. Kale looked up as Sigel took a step toward him with a severe look of malice on his face. <BR> <BR>&#34;Stop! Gerron let him go! Sigel, Kale, stop this!&#34; Kale recognized Paige&#39;s voice. <BR> <BR>Gerron loosened his grip, but Sigel disregarded her all together. He plunged his now dagger like blade at Kale. Kale fell to his knees quickly as Sigel&#39;s fist flew over him. <BR> <BR>Kale heard Gerron let out a yelp as he dodged the incoming blow, and Kale shot from his crouching position into Sigel&#39;s midsection. Kale landed on top of Sigel, slapping the hilt from his hand. The blade made a chiming sound as it hit the platform once and bounced off the edge. Kale grabbed Sigel&#39;s throat with his left hand and reared back his right. <BR> <BR>Punch after punch rocked Sigel&#39;s skull as they rained. Each one sent his head on a slight wobble, coming up only to be sent down by another. The arms returned around Kale, lifting him into the air with a tight squeeze. Kale groaned as he clenched his teeth. <BR> <BR>Gerron backed up, taking Kale with him as Sigel rose up onto his right arm, stupefied by the attack. Kale went limp, breathing heavily as he pawed at his own ribs. Paige appeared beside her brother, who was still on his butt, wiping a bit of blood from his lip. <BR> <BR>&#34;Sigel! Are you all right?&#34; Paige asked examining his head. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; He stated staring at Kale with a curious passion. <BR> <BR>&#34;Clymain would have destroyed you.&#34; Kale muttered slightly, &#34;He died at the hands of a beast you couldn&#39;t fathom.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What would that be?&#34; Sigel asked sarcastically as Gerron&#39;s grip loosened and Paige came towards Kale. <BR> <BR>&#34;It was a-&#34; Kale felt his heart sink. <BR> <BR>He envisioned it again, seeing Baron Perenolde&#39;s devious grin, Clymain was there. In the chamber, he heard the Baron&#39;s voice with that offer again. The Baron spoke dominantly, as he always did, &#34;We are going into the forest to exterminate this growing Caustrodon problem. Would you be willing to join the hunt?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That was why...&#34; Kale muttered slightly. <BR> <BR>Paige took his hand and slid under his arm, &#34;You need to rest, Kale, you&#39;re injured.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No. The Baron is hunting Caustrodons soon, where are we?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Caustrodons?&#34; Gerron&#39;s voiced asked from behind. <BR> <BR>&#34;We are in the heart of the Creador Forest. A place where ever the Baron&#39;s touch hasn&#39;t defiled.&#34; Sigel spoke softly as he rose. <BR> <BR>&#34;You need to rest Kale.&#34; Paige insisted again. <BR> <BR>&#34;No! The Baron is turning dead Caustrodons into zombie beast. They have metal, with more arms and hands. Behemoths of metal and undead strength!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;He&#39;s not well.&#34; Sigel spoke lightly as he turned,  &#34;I want a rematch when you&#39;re well, Kale.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, Sigel went around the edge of the building, Kale assumed to a ladder or a rope to get down. <BR> <BR>&#34;Come Kale.&#34; Paige said as she led him back into the hut, Gerron following closely behind. <BR> <BR>&#34;Watch that attitude.&#34; Gerron warned as he helped Paige get Kale into the bed. <BR> <BR>&#34;You don&#39;t understand, that thing killed Clymain, it almost killed me.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;How did they make them?&#34; Gerron asked, with no serious. Almost trying to prove Kale wrong. <BR> <BR>Kale had a vision of the two sorcerers leaving the pit. <BR> <BR>&#34;Necromancers...&#34; He spoke to himself staring at nothing in particular. <BR> <BR>&#34;Necromancers, eh?&#34; Gerron asked sarcastically. <BR> <BR>&#34;Those two in robes, with staves, strange gems affixed on each. They had to have been necromancers!&#34; Kale exclaimed at his realization. <BR> <BR>Gerron smirked as he began to leave the room, &#34;I&#39;ll make sure that only your brother&#39;s pride was hurt. Later, Paige.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Good bye, Gerron.&#34; Paige said quietly as he left, &#34;Kale, you shouldn&#39;t have done that.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;He insulted my friend, I just snapped.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You killed his friend, Kale.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What? When?&#34; <BR> <BR>Paige looked at him sadly, &#34;You and your friend and the Baron, you killed many of his friends.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale&#39;s eyes opened wide as he asked, &#34;You&#39;re the raiders? Those bandits that attacked us?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You killed one of Sigel&#39;s best friends.&#34; She said lightly, &#34;Sigel saw it.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale closed his eyes, &#34;Are you going to execute me now?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No, only myself, Gerron, and Sigel know you&#39;re the one from the caravan.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;So, Sigel will have me executed now?&#34; <BR> <BR>Paige smiled lightly, &#34;We need strong allies, now more than ever.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kale closed his eyes, his body kicking itself for Kale&#39;s foolish attack. Kale&#39;s thoughts slipped into dark, into dreams again. Hopefully, his sleep here would actually be him waking from this nightmare. <BR> <BR> <BR>Watch for the next installment. CHB
