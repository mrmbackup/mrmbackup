 --- <BR> <BR>The many sounds of various humans…screaming, yelling, cheering for the victor of the outrageous battles that were to take place. Our little troublemaker, the mechanical dragon, stared down into the coliseum from a safe distance, watching as a Tiger and his rancher, were about to battle quite a tough opponent: A Kato and his trainer stepping forward into the ring. But no matter how much it wanted to stay and watch the match, it couldn’t. Instead, a gentle growl escaped the Dragon’s mouth, and soon departed South, towards a duo of strange mountains. <BR> <BR>The mountains were so black and cynical, they could be one with the sky. Its rocky ledges, spiked out for further danger, despite its height. Dark clouds began to form across the lands and within seconds, began to drizzle rain. The water pounded the earth like several drums beating together. The dragon, halfway before reaching its destination, only gritted its teeth, loathing the rain so much. <BR> <BR>At long last, the Dragon reached the mountains rocky ledge. Still out in the rain, but was glad to be able to sit down again. The dragon let out a triumphant roar down the cave of the mountain, hoping to grab his master’s attention. And indeed it has. But instead of an encouragement from his master, he only received a stone flung at his head. The dragon cowered in fear, obviously aware that his master was not pleased at all. <BR> <BR>“Fool! Do you have any idea how late you are?! You should’ve been done hours ago!! What happened out there?!” the only response the rancher received was his dragon lowering its head in shame. Two monsters were watching this from behind their master’s back. One was thinking about stopping his temper, but was soon stopped by a feathery hand, which landed upon his shoulder, warning him against it. Both monsters watched helplessly as their friend was being punished for his misdeeds. <BR> <BR>Short of temper, the rancher whipped out what appeared to be nothing but a steel whipped, coiled with many barbs. The rancher struck his pose, ready to give his dragon a full punishment. “You’ll pay for slacking off from your missions!” Ready to strike like a cobra, the dragon curled up, defending itself, ready for the full blow…but somehow…never received it. It turned around, only to see the whip being held back by something in the shadows. The rancher growled with anger. <BR> <BR>“Calm yourself, James. There’s no need for violence in this mountain. Besides, you shouldn’t treat your poor Gameprobot like that…” <BR> <BR>James only snuffed. “If he would’ve done what he was told, then maybe I wouldn’t have punished him…” A dark glare shot towards his dragon, which was now cowering before his master out in the rain. James turned back to the voice in the shadows. “So, what is that’s so important that pulls me away from my own business, huh?” <BR> <BR>The shadow, not showing any fear at all, sighed. “I have called you here for your help. I need you to help me on this search that I soon to embark on.” <BR> <BR>James, however, only seemed to be impatient about this. “Okay, so we help you go on a wild goose chase for nothing? That sure sounds rewarding…” But the shadow kept its cool… <BR> <BR>“I may also need to remind you all that I have an answer to this. Quite some time ago, I came across an ancient tablet containing an old prophecy about this world’s future… or at least that’s what I think it’s about…” <BR> <BR>This seemed to make James a little suspicious with his business partner. “You think? Why don’t you know, rat? Aren’t you the genius in this group?” The shadow was about to answer, when James realized what he had just said. “…Oh, wait. You can’t be the genius here, because we all ready have one: Me!” <BR> <BR>The shadow finally spoke with frustration. “I’m…I’m not sure what it says. The language, the wording…it’s so ancient, it would take days for me to read clearly.” James turned his back on the shadow, until he could hear his partner, mumbling something about the tablet. <BR> <BR>“What was that?” James spat out. <BR> <BR>The shadow quickly answered back. “Umm…I was…er…saying that I’d read the first line IF I could, but I’d need a better studying area do finish my work. That’s all.” James snorted at the creature, turning towards his nearly rusted Gameprobot, along with him two other monsters following just behind him.  <BR> <BR>“Well then, the next time we meet, you’d better decode that tablet toy of yours, or it’ll be death for your actions!” And, without turning his back once, parked himself on top of his Dragon. Whistling loud and clear, the monsters motioned forward out from the cave and out to the world. The Dragon flew high, his Centaur landing upon the ground, then galloping gallantly, and a purple humanoid bird with many various vivid colors flew side by side next to the dragon. Within minutes, all four of them had disappeared into the stormy sky, the rain covering their shadows. <BR> <BR>The shadow within the cave took a deep breath, looking back at the past three minutes where he could’ve been really dead. “That…was too close.” In the shadows, the sound of solid rock could be heard by the shadow. “If I were to reveal the first part of this sacred prophecy to a man like THAT, surely he would twist the words around. But no matter what, I have to decode this as fast as possible.” Gently, the rock tablet was put down unto the rocky floor. The shadow yawned loudly. “But, for now…it is late. Perhaps I shall begin my work tomorrow, when the sun rises early enough.” A few movements here and there, and the shadow was soon sounds asleep, its purple tail covering itself from the world. <BR> <BR>But what the shadow didn’t discover, however, was the first part of the tablet was…glowing. Glowing an eerie green energy, as the first words were lit brightly: <BR> <BR>The dawn of a new beginning will arise where the birds dare not fly <BR>That is the key to the natural state <BR>Inside, ranchers with greed’s eye will fall for russet medals <BR>But will soon fall to the shadow devil’s feet… <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>WOW…that took too long. Sorry about that! I’ve been doing a lot of homework lately &#42;sigh&#42; Well, anyway, I hope you enjoy. I’ll try to put up a new story soon, but expect it to be good^^;;
