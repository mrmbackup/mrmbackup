 From the day of origins to the passing seasons, you were here by my side. i can never forget the hardships we over came, or the never ending fame we had earned. it was not i who had fought, but they insisted on calling me the winner, i had told before that the true winner is no one. we had everything in our grasp, and everyone feared us, but your life ended in tragedy. the one who killed you i have killed, my madness still surrounds me. you are the only one who i have befriended so easily, and your life shall not be in vain. i hold your gift yet, and await the renewal of your glory. for once this monster shall awaken, your rebirth shall be holy. soon we will meet again upon the same fated land. i will keep you alive through another, Machina, and your tittle will never end.

 Dude, i like it, but you have lots to learn about poetry. It was very hard to understand in this big jumbled up heap of words. Maybe if you worte it like this- <BR>--------------------------------------------- <BR>From the day of origins to the passing seasons, you were here by my side.  <BR>I can never forget the hardships we overcame, or the never ending fame we had earned.  <BR> <BR>It was not I who had fought, but they insisted on calling me the winner. <BR>I had told before that the true winner is no one.  <BR> <BR>We had everything in our grasp, and everyone feared us, but your life ended in tragedy. The one who killed you I have killed, my madness still surrounds me. <BR> <BR>You are the only one who I have befriended so easily, and your life shall not be in vain. I hold your gift yet, and await the renewal of your glory. for once this monster shall awaken, your rebirth shall be holy. <BR> <BR>Soon we will meet again upon the same fated land. I will keep you alive through another, Machina, and your title will never end. <BR>---------------------------------------------  <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t correct your mistakes, just the spelling and the format. Even so, you need work. Your poem has little consistency, as see above, and I only made it that way because I made each stanza sort of stand on its own, which can bring out the true meaning of a poem. You also might want a title. Even though its not much, you may wish to make the title the name of the monster, Machina. I know its kind of lame, but I haven&#39;t been sleeping well and my brain&#39;s not working. Oh well, I&#39;ve leave all of the critical stuff to CHB.

 Sorry for the double post, but forget the consistency thing. It was all messed up in the writing, but it actually does have consisitency in the post. Sorry! :&#41;
