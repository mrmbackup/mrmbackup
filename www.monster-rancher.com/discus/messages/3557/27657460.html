<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF='mailto:carlcarlisle@msn.com'>Carl Carlisle</A></B> on <B>Friday, November 24, 2000 - 07:06 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 The old man was beginning to wonder if it was a bad idea to buy Fluffy from Doris. The kitten hid under the table, clinging to his legs during his entire meal. And then she tried to follow him into the outhouse after they left the Silky Claw. <BR> Her collar that he leashed to his belt seemed like a ridiculous precaution, considering how many times he nearly tripped over feet. Intelligent as she may be, she had difficulty in remembering to stay two or three steps behind him. The slow pace that he strolled was a tough adjustment for this spry pixie to get used to. <BR> <BR>At the docks, where the Storm Rider unloaded it&#39;s cargo, the captain looked toward his young ward in dismay. Fagin had taken upon himself to raise his nephew, since the disappearance of the boy&#39;s parents. <BR> Art was a bright boy, but was severely lacking in common sense. His early talent showed at the age of seven, when he managed to steal a wagon load of apple preserves from the McKin farm. Outside of the arena, during the spring tournament, the boy sold the preserves for a good price to the out-of-towners. <BR> When some of the customers asked what kind of apples were in the preserves, the boy replied &#34;McKinlost apples&#34;. McKin got wind of this, and caught the boy after nearly all the preserves were sold. &#40;To this day, people refer to the apples grown around here as &#39;McKinlost apples&#39;.&#41; <BR> McKin took all the money and let the boy go. But, these people don&#39;t forget. The town keeps a close eye on this little trouble maker. <BR> Two years after that, the boy&#39;s parents mysteriously vanished. Even the local seer, his aunt by marriage, counldn&#39;t figure out what happened. <BR> Fagin had been raising his brother&#39;s son for four years now. For these past two weeks, Art was living on broth and juice. He&#39;s visibly thinner and paler to anyone who knows him. And is now having too much difficulty getting his land legs to be of any use with the unloading of the ship. <BR> The disappointed captain decided to let his nephew sleep on the pile of fish nets, that he had made his way to. <BR> <BR>Deck hands were nearly done unloading the booty for sale, at Shipper&#39;s Square; when the rest of Captain Fagin&#39;s ships made their way through the fog. <BR> With word that the Storm Rider arrived, Hollow Oaks became alive with everyone entering the streets. To reunite families, and to try to be the first to buy something needed or rare. <BR> <BR> Being the first and only monster rancher present, the captain greeted Carl, and directed him to items of special interests. Doris, suspecting that the necromancer was going to be offered the best deals, dropped in on them. <BR> Lifting the lid off a long wooden box, the old salt proclaimed&#34;Look at these stun sticks here. I betcha ain&#39;t be see&#39;n this kind since the war ended.&#34; Gingerly picking up one of the eight foot long ebony poles, pointing at the upside down egg-shaped tip, where a thick blunt needle barely protruded from the top. &#34;Ya got me word, they&#39;re all fresh. Good fer a few heavy stuns each. Four dozen there be.&#34; <BR> Setting the stun stick back into the crate, he reached for the only stick that was wrapped in a blood stained chesecloth. &#34;This hare stick is yer type.&#34; Carefully unwrapping it, he whispered &#34;I think this one might be made special. It sure be pretty.&#34; The softer grains along the length appears to be worn or meticulously sanded in deeper than the harder grains. Instead of the egg-shaped top, a crowned ebony skull with rubies set into the eye sockets, adorned the needle end. Rather than it being uncapped at the bottom, a thick circular ruby seemed to be somehow glued tightly there. &#34;Now ye can&#39;t be tell&#39;n me that this ain&#39;t be worth nothin&#39;! Even if it be used up, makes fer a fine walk&#39;n stick.&#34; <BR> &#34;Worth probably more than I can afford.&#34;,Carl admitted. <BR> Doris snorted in sarcasm. She&#39;s standing with the town&#39;s two richest men. <BR> &#34;Nah. Ye know I be deal&#39;n fair with ya. I gots to be earn&#39;n me supper.&#34; <BR> Doris&#39;s eyes rolled up, wondering if mushrooms are going to sprout where they stand. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now, these be not from down the coast!&#34; Fagin cheerfully pop the lids off of three barrels. Inside each, rested some kind of strange odd looking fruits. <BR> Doris picked one up and sniffed. Her nose scrunched up and the corners of her mouth curved sharply down. &#34;Uhg! They stink!&#34; <BR> The captain took it from her and handed it to the old man. &#34;Here then. Ye try it.&#34; <BR> After taking a whiff, it appeared as if his long shaggy hair and beard suddenly drooped. &#34;Who are you kidding?&#34; <BR> &#34;Well then. May haps it be monster food. Why don&#39;t ya let that thar thing try it?&#34; <BR> &#34;Old softie wouldn&#39;t take the chance of hurting one of his precious little monsters.&#34;, she chided. Both the captain and the tavern keeper laughed, along with some of the other town folks within hearing distance. <BR> Angered by the insult, as well as to protect his honor, Carl handed the fruit to Fluffy. &#34;Eat this.&#34; Without hesitation, the kitten began to eat the peach and began purring. Secretly, the necromancer was relieved. He didn&#39;t want to buy a monster, only to kill it the same day. <BR> &#34;Ah. Jes as I thought. It be monster food.&#34; Carl and Doris stared at him unconvinced. This prompted Fagin to head over to a pile of ten crates. Opening one, he stood to the side to let the other two see. <BR> <BR>  &#34;I&#39;ve never seen a whole one before.&#34;, Doris exclaimed. <BR> &#34;Venture ta say, no one in these hare parts have. I have me a whole mess of &#39;em, all sorts o&#39; colors in all these hare crates.&#34; <BR> &#34;Always thought they started out as round. But, I sure would hate to break them up to use them. These would be put to better use by decorating my lab with them. How many do you have?&#34; <BR> <BR> After haggling prices and making delivery arrangements, they headed over to the ships containing monsters. Enroute, Fagin was met up by his wife Megan; as his stepdaughter, Pearl mercilessly teased Art nearby. <BR> &#34;Just as I foretold. He&#39;s not meant for the high seas.&#34; His wife scolded him as if he were a child, often in front of anyone at anytime. <BR> &#34;Hmmm. Well, yes. But, I had to be sure,&#34; the old salt grumbled. Although, the people of this land recognized seers as reliable witnesses and investigators concerning criminal matters, it was obvious that Fagin has his doubts concerning all of them. <BR> <BR> By the time they got to where the monster ships were being docked, the &#39;Widow Hopper&#39; was already waiting. She was accompanied by one of her assistants, who was busily giving her a scalp massage. She had developed quite a reputation in two ways. <BR> 1.&#41; She loves hoppers. Thus the name, Widow Hopper. People started calling her that years ago by all the attention she garnered during just one tournament. Not only was her competing hopper sucessful in killing everyone of it&#39;s opponents. But, also how she chose to adorn her trademark &#40;3 foot wide brim&#41; straw hat. <BR> On that particular day, she cut the arms off of three living baby hoppers and chained them together at the top center of her hat. Everyone thought that it was so cute when she went up for the prize money. <BR> 2.&#41; She only hires strong, young, muscular assistants for her ranch. The young men, who did a very good job of &#39;pleasing&#39; her before she gets a craving for someone new; she gives more than enough money to start their own ranch, here or in another town. Every boy in town has tried to get hired by her, but she is very selective. <BR> <BR> &#34;Good afternoon all. Are there any hoppers Fagin?&#34; <BR> &#34;Aye. I&#39;ve got the only two put aside jes fer you.&#34; <BR> &#34;Wonderful!&#34; <BR> <BR> The monsters sold quickly, as expected. Doris wasn&#39;t able to get another pixie yet. However, she did get a suezo for cleaning the floors. Some people bought hares to hire out, to pick apples and collect buckets of maple syrup. Karen the butcher bought an old bat to keep flies and mosquitoes away from her shop. Other people bought monsters for their meat and hides. <BR> Not finding the naga that he was looking for. The old necromancer decided to begin his two day journey home before the sun begins to set. With good timing, he should be able to make camp well beyond Sticky&#39;s maple farm.

 Thank you. <BR>I hope that you&#39;re going to do more writing yourself. I&#39;ll try even harder to behave myself. Especially, with your posts.
