 I walked into the stadium to many loud noises: people cheering, &#40;either for me or my opponent&#41; vendors selling things, monsters making their various sounds, and, finally, the loud speakers saying, “Battle four of the Spring Tournament, Level E, Round Robin, begins in a minute. Breeders, get your monsters ready!” <BR> <BR>My battle plan was simple. Golems are slow and Gaboos are inaccurate. Devlin, because of his good accuracy, would take on the stronger looking of the two, the Marble Guy, and Stefioni, because of her good speed would take on the Gaboo. <BR> <BR>A giant gong was rung, and the battle began. The Marble Guy took a swing at Devlin, but he dodged it with ease. “Quick, Devlin, electrocute him! Stefioni, use that life sucking move!” After I had said that, I felt so stupid, for Golems are made of rock, and what would electricity to it? But, I was wrong. Devlin’s attack created massive amounts of damage. In my mind, I thanked Thomas for his advice. I would have never trained Devlin in intelligence. Stefioni’s move didn’t do too much damage, but it gave her a pretty good energy boost. Devlin had the Cat’s Eye in a corner, so to speak. But, instead of fighting Devlin, he took off his arm and threw it to the Gaboo! &#40;Which in turn, KO’d him&#41;  <BR> <BR>The Gaboo then took the arm, and began to spin around. He then threw the arm with extreme velocity at Devlin!  I had no clue a monster could do such a technical move at Rank E. The arm struck Devlin. It was an instant KO! I had fight the urge to go out and help him, for it would have disqualified me.  <BR> <BR>While the Gaboo was recovering, Stefioni went over to Devlin, and, using the energy she had acquired from draining the Gaboo, revived Devlin. He looked good as new! I rejoiced!  <BR> <BR>With renewed spirit, Devlin began his lightning attack. “No!” I cried. He hit Stefioni with a blinding blast of electricity. What I saw next astonished me. Stefioni was unharmed. She then charged at the Gaboo, and began a berserk attacked, KO’ing him. The match was over, and we won. <BR> <BR>Afterwards, the breeder I had fought came up to me and said, “Hey, great match. Interesting monsters, I have never seen ones like them. Do you know much about them?” <BR> <BR>“To tell you the truth, I don’t know much about them at all. My name is James Nottap, what’s yours?” <BR> <BR>“It’s Hannah, Hannah Wagonblast. This is my Marble Guy, Cat’s Eye, and my Gaboo, Cookie-Dough. I think you just made a rival, James. I hope to fight you again soon. One word of advice, when you fight the breeder named Gavin, watch out. My next fight is against him. He fights dirty, but not enough to be illegal.” <BR> <BR>“Thanks for the heads up” We parted, and went to me tent to care for my monster’s wounds. Stefioni had completely healed Devlin. “Better keep remember to use that one once and a while,” I thought, and chuckled. Our next match wasn’t starting for a while, so we went to the stands to watch the others fight. <BR> <BR>We saw Hannah in the ring, with her monster’s, about to fight some other breeder. He was short, and of a bit stalky build. He had hair that was sort of curly, and was died a rusty red. “This must be Gavin,” I thought to myself. His monsters were a Pure Gali, and a Pure Joker. I’d only a few times seen a Joker, and each time it gave me the creeps.  <BR> <BR>The match was stared, and within seconds, Both Cat’s Eye and Cookie-Dough were on the ground. I was amazed! I had a tough time beating those guys, and Gavin wiped the floor with him! How was I supposed to beat him? The loudspeaker broke my train of thought. “The next match is James with Stefioni the Pure Ogyo and Devlin the Pure Gitan vs. Gavin with Galiant the Pure Gali and Raffiel the Pure Joker! Contestants to you booths! The match will start I ten mintues” Oh shoot! I’m going ot get massacred! <BR> <BR>	 <BR> <BR> <BR>	 <BR>Here&#39;s the next part, enjoy!
