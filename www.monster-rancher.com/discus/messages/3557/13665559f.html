The rangers were surrounded by Mahjor&#39;s minions. All were silent and still. They were all secretly blood-thirsty. <BR> <BR>     There were 3 very long and loud thumps. Then, they all charged, shouting battle-cries. Suddenly, Huong, out of nowhere, rushed out, and thrust his hands out to them. He screamed something in a foreign language, and a strange beam came out from his hands. It out-stretched to every minion, and, with awesome force, destroyed their Mahjio-grams. They all fell, looked around probably thinking what they were doing, and died. <BR> <BR>     The rangers were astonished. &#34;How did you do that!?&#34; Solon asked. Huong was exhausted, looking drained of energy. &#34;It was a <I>Ray of Huong</I>, one of my most powerful techniques. It is to heal all wounds. Any wound. I told you to follow my cracks in the walls. Why did you disobey?&#34; Zagref looked angry. &#34;We did, and we ended up in a He#$-hole!&#34; Huong was then struck with fear. &#34;It was the GREAT BETRAYER!!! I know!&#34; <BR>  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR>     Out of that room, they decided to clear out the room, and go to sleep. That is when Zagref had that dream again. Lot spoke to him again. <BR>  <BR>     &#34;Zagref, you will be encountered with the Great Betrayer soon. Do not be afraid. You are the most powerful Ranger. I know. Part of my spirit was set unto you. You will be empowered by me. I will help you. But know that <I>he</I> will be empowered by Mahjor. You will be equally matched. I must leave you now, Zagref. I will help youuuuuu...&#34; Zagref awoke. That is when he was led through a dark hallway. He heard a voice, and saw someone in the shadows. &#34;Zagref, I am the Betrayer. I am sure you have heard of me. Now, I am prepared to offer you a deal. You give me your companions, and I will let you go. In fact, I will give you great power, unimaginable power. But give me your companions and I will give you great power, and freedom.&#34; <BR> <BR>     &#34;That is an offer that I cannot take. I will kill you for trying to kill <B>us</B>. Now die.&#34; Zagref lunged at the shadow. Pulled him from the shadows, and saw him. It was...<B>Hijora</B>!!! &#34;Hijora, <I>you</I> are the Betrayer!?&#34; Hijora chuckled. &#34;I have fooled you for years. You are such an <I>idiot</I>. I thought you already knew. Now I will show you my true power!!!&#34; Hijora rocketed towards Zagref, and <I>Flame Punched</I> him. Zagref went flying through a wall. He staggered to get back up. &#34;Aagggghhhh, You will pay.&#34; Zagref used his <I>Vulcan Spark</I> and smashed Hijora. His turban fell off. He had a different type of Mahjio-gram. It was a skull with an M in the middle. This meant he was the Betrayer.                 <BR>      <BR>     The Rangers ran to Zagref&#39;s side. &#34;Hijora, I always knew you were evil. But never like this.&#34; Soluv said. All of a sudden, the shadows were cleared. They were in the Grand Hall. Mahjor stepped out of the Great Door. &#34;Haaahaahaaa, you are all idiots. My apprentice led you all here. Now you will die!!!&#34; <BR> <BR>     Then, Mahjor had a green mist oozing from him. All plants that were around it died. Everything died, Except for Mahjor and his Minions, including Hijora. The rangers were starting to run, and saw Huong. &#34;Come on, I will hold the mist, and I will beam you out of here.&#34; Huong beamed them out. They were outside. <BR> <BR>     &#34;Come on, we have to get out of here. This place is deadly!&#34; Soluv said to Zagref, who was speechless. Zagref did not belive it, he did not want to believ it, but it was true... <BR> <BR>To be continued.....
