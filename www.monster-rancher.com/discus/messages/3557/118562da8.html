 I couldn&#39;t resist posting this, as I just rediscovered it in some belongs I was unpacking. My dad wrote it in 1987, when I was 3 years old, almost 4. I know it doesn&#39;t have the best rhyming in the world, but the point it makes it very awesome. In my mind, anyway. <BR> <BR>For Both a Life Lesson <BR> <BR>I sat and watched you, <BR>tugging at your tricycle stuck between <BR>the tree and the fence, <BR> <BR>and smiled. <BR> <BR>It wouldn&#39;t be long, before it came free, <BR>Or you called out to me. <BR>Soon, you stopped in frustration, <BR>And climbed aboard anyway. <BR>To make the best of the situation. <BR> <BR>I smiled. <BR> <BR>I knew you had accepted compromise, <BR>instead of defeat. <BR> <BR>Later on, I brought home a puppy <BR>that you carried around by the neck, <BR>But, it loved you any way. <BR> <BR>I smiled. <BR> <BR>Soon you learned which decision would make <BR>The dog run and hide, or a friend for life. <BR>This too, made me smile. <BR>For people are the same way, too. <BR> <BR>My tool box had many shiney things, <BR>Some of which you thought were yours. <BR>And you never suspected, <BR>They were carefully selected, one by one. <BR>No sharp edges. <BR> <BR>You smiled. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t see how I can do anything outside anymore, <BR>With out your help, and your little tools. <BR>Which really makes me smile. <BR> <BR>I still wait for your call, <BR>When things get stuck <BR>or the water hose gets a kink in it. <BR>You learned a long time ago what dads are for, <BR>Though you call less now than before, <BR> <BR>I know. <BR> <BR>Its called growing up. <BR>             And it takes us both. <BR> <BR> <BR>-Tommy L.
