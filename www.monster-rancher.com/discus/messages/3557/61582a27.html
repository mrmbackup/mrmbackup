 My name is Elov Pirtacor, and I have recently been hired by both the IMA and FIMBA organizations create biology reports on monsters that are to be released to the public.  I have decided to do my first report on the Phoenix, a monster which has now become wildly popular with ranchers of all skill levels.  Part of my studies were done in a laboratory, some in a ranch, and also some in the wild so that I could discover all aspects of this amazing creature. <BR> <BR>  The first question that may come to a trainer&#39;s mind is: Where does all that fire come from?  It&#39;s rather simple really.  The phoenix emits a gas from pores that run all across it&#39;s body.  This gas is highly flammable, and the bird can increase the output when it wants to waft the flames at an aggressor.  It also keeps an oil-like substance inside a chamber that is connected to it&#39;s stomach.  For lack of a better word, it will &#34;vomit&#34; this liquid at an opponent, igniting it just as it leaves the mouth creating a ball of fire.  However, all of this still doesn&#39;t explain how it can out of nowhere summon a stream of hot molten lava!  This is still mostly a mystery, but recent theories suggest that it almost has a psychicbond with the melted rock that rests beneath the earth&#39;s crust.  If this theory is correct, it could simply summon it up through the ground and send it towards an opponent in a stream &#40;or when it becomes more adept at it, a wave!&#41;.  On an interestring note, the rare Cinder Bird seems to have a defect in it&#39;s genetics, since it is not on fire all the time but rather only when it is attacking. <BR> <BR>  Although there is only one documented wild phoenix, I was in fact lucky enough to get the chance to study it for a few days in the barren mountains of Kawrea.  It&#39;s nature is, not surprisingly, solitary.  It seems to bide it&#39;s time to defend it&#39;s territory &#40;which seems to be about 5 miles around it&#39;s nest&#41;, and eating. Phoenixes are carnivores hands down, and it&#39;s diet seems to mostly consist of rock worms, for which the phoenix waits for on a high cliff, then swoops down to snag one with it&#39;s large talons once it surfaces.  I also witnessed it eating Zuums, Nagas, and small birds.  The phoenix seems to have no natural enemies, although I witnessed a marvelous battle between it and a pterodactyl that got too close to it&#39;s home!  When this monster rwaches a point in it&#39;s life when it is too weak to continue as normal, it sinks itself deep inside the volcano, regenerating it&#39;s body using the tremendous heat.  Since quite possibly makes it immortal, so the one that I studied may well be thousands of years old! <BR> <BR>  All in all, the phoenix is a fascinating creature, one that any true naturalist dreams of seeing.  Perhaps one day we will learn more, but until then, there are still countless monsters to be documented.  Until next time! <BR> <BR>-Elov Pirtacor
