 Part 1 <BR> <BR>The Gitan and the Ogyo are sort of like the Gali and the Joker relationship. One is more of the evil, harsh side and the other is pure, cute, and well…pink. Who knew that these two wholly different monsters would form a bond as tight as they did. What started out as an effort to save my ranch, became a lot more… <BR> <BR> <BR>	At the time, I was feeling very down. My best friend, Thomas, had just moved away, I was out of a job, &#40;I was his ranching assistant&#41; and I was close to having to sell the ranch we had worked so hard on. I had recently received permission to start raising a monster of my own, but what was the use? The ranch had to be sold, or I would starve. As I went in to clear out my belongings, I found a package with my name on it. It read: <BR> <BR>“Dear James, <BR>	I am very apologetic that I must leave you, but it cannot be helped. You know how ill my father is, and I must attend to him. I know that you’ll soon be receiving permission to raise a monster, so I have left you this little gift. It is a very special disc that I found one day while exploring with my tiger, Shane. I believe you will enjoy it. <BR>Your friend, <BR>Thomas C. Marcus” <BR>	 <BR>	Reading the letter made feel all warm inside, instead if the cold, twisted feeling I had been feeling the past few days. I put the note aside and opened up the package, which revealed a monster disc. This was no ordinary monster disc, though. If you held it to the right light, you could see two images. One was of a fish like thing and of a sort of odd rabbit, with a pitchfork, and a long, fat tail. <BR>	I brought it to the local shrine the next day, hoping to get a good monster, so I could make money to help the ranch. I walked through the shrine doors, and saw the shrine keeper, Alexander Webb. He always creeped me out. I don’t think he liked me very much either. He was about 5’ 6” of a stout build and had jet black hair that was always greased down with something that vaguely reminded you of Baku fat. Go figure. He walked up to me, and in a raspy voice said, “Yeah, wadda ya want, Jimmy?” <BR>	“Um…,” I replied, I really hated it when people called me Jimmy, especially him. “I’d like to revive the monster from this disc, please.” The politeness obviously didn’t affect him. He took the disc with a grunt. He set it place and started the regeneration process. The disc, floating in the air, spun as usual, but had an eerie glow of pink and black to it. Suddenly, the ground started to shake, and everything went black, but I and the Shrine Keeper were still awake. “What’s wrong with your stupid shrine!?” <BR>	“Hold on, Jimmy. &#40;He seemed to enjoy calling me that&#41; Let me just light a… OUCH! Looks like the candles are light. What did your disc do to my shrine!?” Just then, an blinding light came out and the rumbling stopped. I could see again. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Standing in front of me were two totally different monsters I had never seen in my life! <BR>	 <BR> <BR>What do you guys think....should I continue?
