<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:dstsaoi@comcast.net>DarkBlitzX</A></B> on <B>Thursday, February 12, 2004 - 01:24 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 Before I continue my story, I would like to add some facts that weren&#39;t in the prologue. <BR> <BR>1.&#41; Darkness is a Bushi-do &#40;MRA2&#41; <BR>2.&#41; If the land had lines going across it separating it into fourths, The Dark Army would be at the first line from the south pole. <BR>3.&#41; The land can be defined by four sections. Moving north from the South Pole, they are: Jungles and forest with some grassy, open areas and some rivers. More north, scattered forests and plains until you come to a giant mountain range. After that is an area known as &#34;the land of ice and fire&#34; because the drastically different areas create a land of volcanoes and rivers of magma, but right beside them are giant fields of ice and snowy terrain. After that comes the land of X- Blitz, a Reflector &#40;MRA2&#41;. The land has been transformed into a giant mass of dead plants and cloudy skies with various types of robots with AI scattered everywhere. In the very middle of it all sits the fortress of X- Blitz. <BR>4.&#41; If you ignore the exaggerated numbers :P in chapter 1 then I can fix the population problem. Ok, first i want this to be a HUGE planet, lets say.........the size of Jupiter. Well then, the on land population is about uh.... 352 earths in Jupiter, divide by 2, 176. Ok, uh, 176 x 6, - take away 1/4, u get...the population of the entire planet is about 792 billion...that’s TOO much, lets say 100 billion. 75 billion men and children, 25 billion men, 150 billion monsters and machines. There are 1000 armies that have lasted more than a year, plus about the 300 or so that pop up and then are destroyed so the survivors can be inducted into the winner’s army. I think that’s right. Now then, I think the Dark Army should have.........500000 soldiers. X-Blitz has 2 million. Uh...too complicated with so many armies, but i got myself into it by writing that prologue... <BR> <BR>---------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>&#34;Sir!&#34; yelled Deathbringer as he slowed to a slow walk beside Darkness&#39; caravan. &#34;Were about to enter the Yatu jungle in an hour or so. Do you wish for a short scouting trip before we enter, sir?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No, no, I do believe we are quite safe if we stay on the well- beaten path. However, I do need to see Lord Miyama, so get him for me, would you?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes sir,&#34; said the Durahan as he saluted and then rode toward the vanguard. <BR> <BR>&#34;What a wonderful bliss to be young and not have seen yet the horror of war.. &#34;The dark knight muttered to himself as he scanned the list of armies. He himself had enchanted the list to make it write and erase armies’ names once they appeared or were destroyed. However, Darkness didn&#39;t need the entire list this time. He was only interested in those armies that were above him in the list, because the list ran down from most powerful to least, encompassing all 1000 or so armies. <BR> <BR>&#34;X-Blitz, Magmaheart, Bluecinder, Rakor, The Mintora Kingdom, Helldemon, The silver protectors, Orsimar, The black plague, The Zan fighter union rebels, Blacishka, Furion, Mesteranuin, ..&#34; <BR> <BR>Darkness kept reading the 150 or so names above the Dark Army over and over again to himself. Over and over and over and over, trying to prove the different armies innocent of scaring the White Paladins, but there were still too many to pick the right army while being sure it was the right one. <BR> <BR>Finally, fed up with it, he threw the list out of the caravan. As it flew out of the window it made a &#34;clunk&#34; sound. Surprised, the Bushi-do turned toward the other side of the carriage he was in in time to see Miyama enter with the list. <BR> <BR>&#34;You had better keep this, my lord. Now, you wanted to talk to me?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes. As my defensive war general, you must see to it that we are invulnerable to ambush while passing through the forest. Understand?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes sir. “The Durahan turned and left to take care of business. <BR> <BR>----------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>As the army set up camp in the Hydulian fields right outside the jungle, <BR>A myriad of red eyes peered out of the trees, watching the soldiers as they joked about and rested; unaware of what lay ahead in the jungle. <BR> <BR>&#34;Elder, Miyer has spotted a prominent looking Durahan in the camp. Yasher says it is known as a ChuChulainn. Is it he, oh reverent one?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No my child, but only one of his generals. Keep looking. If you cannot find him in the vast army, do not worry. He will be riding at the head of his army when they pass through the jungle tomorrow. It is only when they find the road blocked and they take our detour path when we will confront them. The prophecy of Xempthia is soon to be fulfilled, and the part of the Xycros is soon to start. Now run along child. The sooner we can meet with the he the better.&#34; <BR> <BR>------------------------------------------------ <BR>  <BR>“<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>.” <BR> <BR>Darkness slowed to a stop in front of the tree blocking the path and signaled for the army to stop. He then turned to Deathbringer and said, “Bring me Icebreaker.” <BR> <BR>“Icebreaker, try to lift the tree out of the way so we can pass.” <BR> <BR>“Yes lord,” replied the massive Golem. He turned to the tree and attempted to break it in half using a judo chop, only to bounce off like a stone against a brick wall.  <BR> <BR>“Hmm….” He then tried to lift the tree up, to no avail. He turned to the expectant Durahan and said, “I am sorry my lord, but it seems to have been sealed there.” <BR> <BR>“These foes must have seen us coming and used magic to seal it into the ground….”the Durahan thought to himself. <BR> <BR>“Lord, there is a detour path through the jungle. Do you want to take that path?” said Tsapkiro. <BR> <BR>“Yes, we have to get to the Yarse as soon as possible. Spread the message.” Then he tugged on his horse and set off down the path. <BR> <BR> <BR>“Good work, Miyas. The Durahan has chosen to take the detour. Let us prepare a welcoming banquet for the Durahan and his five lords. Have some of the others to clear the Certial grounds for the other soldiers. We must be hospitable; otherwise the Durahan will not accept us. <BR> <BR>“Now move quickly. We have not much time before they reach the temple.” <BR> <BR> <BR>“Halt.” The Bushi-do raised his hand and looked at the massive temple.  “This looks like a sacred place. Tell the soldiers to take a break. My Lords, come with me.” <BR> <BR>With that the six different Durahans jumped off their horses and walked toward the temple. <BR> <BR>Then the Xycros revealed themselves and stepped out toward the stunned knights. <BR> <BR> <BR>“Welcome, oh Enlightened one.” <BR> <BR>Darkness gasped in awe as 6 deadly looking creatures stepped out if the temple. <BR> <BR>Henger heads. <BR> <BR>Monol bodies. <BR> <BR>Zan arms and blades. <BR> <BR>Golem legs. <BR> <BR>Dragon wings. <BR> <BR>Gitan spears. <BR> <BR>What was the most interesting part, however, was the banner. <BR> <BR>A Durahan that was unmistakably Darkness was imprinted on it. <BR> <BR> <BR>“Come in. We must talk. My tribe will escort your army to grounds where they can stay.” <BR> <BR>“But…how do you know me?” <BR> <BR>“It has been prophesized. <BR> <BR> <BR>“We are the Xycros. In the early days when only monsters ruled, the Xycros took parts from different monsters and made them our own. We ended up with these bodies. However, that is not important. What is important is that we must join your quest, for you alone have seen the truth. You have seen that X-Blitz is the true enemy, and that the armies must rally together to defeat him. You may think that his army is small enough that 10 or 20 different armies can destroy him, but what is not known is how many machines he has. The number of machines populating his land is large enough to destroy almost half the world. He must be stopped.” <BR> <BR>“Well then what is your part in my story?” asked the skeptical Durahan. <BR> <BR>“X-Blitz’s machines cannot be defeated by normal means. Only truly powerful monster can defeat them. But the Xycros are the one tribe that can destroy any machine. However, we are mortal. It is foretold that we must help you get to the evil; fortress… but by the time you get there all the Xycros will have been killed. We only total 250 in all, so we must be careful to live until you can fulfill the prophecy.” <BR> <BR>“Alright. So….where do we go now?” <BR> <BR>“We? No, you misunderstand us. We will not travel with you. You must summon us by means of this stone when the time is right.” <BR> <BR>Without another word the Xycros gave Darkness the stone and left. <BR> <BR> <BR>“Should we believe them?” asked General Lynx. <BR> <BR>“No. I could see from their eyes they were lying. We must be careful of deceit.” Now tell Deathbringer to get Scouts 1-35 to keep watch.” <BR> <BR>“Yes sir.” <BR> <BR>The six generals had retired to their tents to sleep. However, they were still wide-awake, because being trained battle veterans, they were suspicious of the Xycros. <BR> <BR>----------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>The next morning Darkness woke to the sound of combat. He looked around, and realized it was still nighttime. <BR> <BR>He quickly jumped out the tent, battle ready, to find his five lords and many of the soldiers fighting against the Xycros. It appeared the fighting had just started. <BR> <BR>Worried that serious losses would be sustained, Darkness ran towards the nearest Xycros. Taken unaware, the Xycros had no chance to defend itself before getting its head lopped off. <BR> <BR>&#34;GO FOR THE HEAD! HENGERS HAVE WEAK BODIES!” yelled the dark Durahan. He then ran toward the center of the action, his entire council of Lords against the six elder Xycros. <BR> <BR>It appeared they were losing to the powerful Xycros, but then the well-trained Durahan stepped in. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fire sword!&#34; he yelled as his katanas turned into twirling disks of blazing fire. Being a special Durahan, he had found he could harness the power of the elements in his double-katanas. <BR> <BR>&#34;YYAAAAAA&#34; yelled the Xycros in agony. It quickly retaliated with a slashing combo that ended with a kick and a giant beam. <BR> <BR>The now battered Durahan landed in the dirt and quickly pulled himself together. <BR> <BR>&#34;Regroup!&#34; the Xycros yelled. <BR> <BR>&#34;You have no chance, you ugly pieces of junk. You&#39;re WAY outnumbered.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, we’ve studied you, and we realized you have leader to leader fights.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yea...but I don&#39;t extend that honor to traitors. However, your food is pretty good so I&#39;ll agree to a six on six fight. My council and me v. your elders.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Agreed.&#34; <BR> <BR>------------------------------------------------ <BR> <BR>Pain. Anguish. Agony. Torture. <BR> <BR>All those thoughts ripped through Darkness&#39; head as consecutive rays hit him. <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s not over, <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>,&#34; He cursed and ran forward. <BR> <BR>The Durahan jumped around the oncoming rays and stuck his sword in the foot of the monster, causing it to topple. Seeing his chance, he ran in between the legs and jumped backwards, coming down on the Xycros&#39; back with blade down. <BR> <BR>He just forgot about a monol&#39;s spikes. <BR> <BR>&#34;AHHHHHHHHH&#34; <BR> <BR>The Bushi-do twisted in midair just in time to miss the spikes and tear the monster&#39;s right wing to pieces. <BR> <BR>&#34;ARGH!&#34; The Xycros threw off the powerful Durahan and immediately used it&#39;s own version of Tempest, scratching the Durahan over and over. <BR> <BR>&#34;Gasp...pant pant pant pant pant....&#34; The Durahan took in shallow breaths as he watched the injured but still standing monster. <BR> <BR>He then saw a weak spot in the monster. A hairline crack in the monol. Obviously this had been an injured monol. <BR> <BR>The Dark Durahan rushed the injured monster, jumping over it and sending an Aura slash into it, making the Xycros fly through the air. He then used several high-powered airshots to make a tornado catch the Xycros and tear at it. Darkness threw some of his daggers in the tornado also, making the Xycros&#39; torture last as long as it could. When the Xycros was finally thrown out of the tornado, it was bruised and battered so bad it looked as if it couldn&#39;t fight. <BR> <BR>&#34;Mercy...&#34; begged the monster. <BR> <BR>&#34;...No...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;SHIING&#34; <BR> <BR>Darkness left the monster to die in it&#39;s own blood and then went to see how his council was doing. <BR> <BR>---------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Inferno banded up with Lynx to form a perfect offensive team. Using their heritage, they sent lightning bolts and fire blast ripping through the Xycros. But when the blast subsided it looked like the Xycros had sustained only minor injuries. <BR> <BR>Lynx and Inferno ran forward, using gust to leave deep gashes in each opponent. As they turned around they were kicked backwards, breaking several trees. <BR> <BR>It was then that Inferno showed why he was second in command, rushing out of the trees and doing multiple turn slashes. The Xycros&#39; wings and blades were quickly obliterated. <BR> <BR>&#34;No matter,&#34; snarled the Xycros as it used lightning and shot it from its spear. As the lightning bolt paralyzed Inferno for a few seconds, the two monsters dashed forward to stab the Durahan, only to find the blades of their spears sheared off by a VERY fast moving Durahan. <BR> <BR>True to his lineage, Lynx was glowing deep black and emanating a cold aura that seemed to freeze anything around him. Channeling ice and lightning into his sword, he shot a beam that was joined with inferno&#39;s fire beam to form an electrified beam of water. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Soggy toast, anyone?&#34; asked Inferno. <BR> <BR>----------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, the other three lords didn&#39;t band up but instead used the same area to fight. Running in zigzags, the three attacked with a multitude of slashes, leaving light gashes on the monsters. <BR> <BR>&#34;Tri- BEAM&#34; yelled the Xycros as each shot a volley toward the Durahans, making them fly into the air. Each Xycros flew up into the air to make the Durahans feel their wrath. Tsapkiro received an axhandle smash in the back, while Miyama got a kick straight into the ground. <BR> <BR> <BR>Nightstalker instead sprouted wings and flew into the air. He had no special powers like the rest of the Lords, but he did have the power of flight. Surprising the three Xycros, he flew above and used a Gaea sword, resulting in a swirl of upward fire that burned them badly. He still had the power of a regular Durahan, after all. <BR> <BR>As the three fell to the ground, their wings too badly damaged to fly; Miyama used his special move and shot a storm of Death Energy balls towards the three. However, they still could fly a little and it looked like they were going to dodge it, when suddenly a blast of energy knocked all of them into the storm. They had no chance. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Heh looks like being half-monol is useful,&#34; <BR>commented Tsapkiro. <BR> <BR>----------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>&#34;Good job. Tomorrow we make the Yarse. When we get there we may be able to see what scared off the White Paladins. Now go heal and rest. You&#39;ll need it,&#34; said Darkness. <BR> <BR>The rest of the Xycros had been killed by the Dark Army&#39;s new firing squad, the pixies that were from the forest. Apparently they had been pretty accurate hunters there. But now was time to think about the future, not the past.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh yea,&#34; said Darkness. He pulled the Xycros&#39; stone out and looked at it. It was a piece of regular old granite. He threw it out the window. <BR> <BR>&#34;Clunk. OOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW&#34; <BR> <BR>-Comments please.

 Getting better. You should be more descriptive with your fights though. <BR> <BR>&#34;&#34;YYAAAAAA&#34; yelled the Xycros in agony. It quickly retaliated with a slashing combo that ended with a kick and a giant beam. <BR> <BR>The now battered Durahan landed in the dirt and quickly pulled himself together.&#34; <BR> <BR>That part didn&#39;t flow to well in my mind. Seeing that you improve by leaps and bounds, I&#39;m positive your next battles will be great. Never be afraid to be overly descriptive in them, either.
