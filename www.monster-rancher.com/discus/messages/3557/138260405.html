 Darktalon flew high above the canopy. His large, black, leathery wings beat with terrible power as he proudly tore through the smoke-filled sky. Vision was limited, and try as he might, Naharud could only see a few feet in ahead of him. Trying to scan the forest floor from such an altitiude was impossible. <BR> <BR>&#34;Is there any way you can decsend a bit?&#34; Naharud asked. He hated flying, and air sickness was getting to him, he wanted to be as close to the ground as possible. <BR> <BR>&#34;No can do. I can&#39;t see as it is.If I fly any lower I might run into a tree.&#34; the Ragnarocks answered. &#34;Besides, I think we&#39;re getting close to the heart of it, the smoke&#39;s thickining. I&#39;ll be landing soon.&#34; He was right, Naharud noticed. It was getting increasingly harder to see. He could barely make out his own hand in front of his face. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well then, fly faster!&#34; Naharud ordered. &#34;I don&#39;t know how much longer I can take this.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Watch it up there!&#34; the black dragon snapped. &#34;I just had a bath! If you so much as gag, you&#39;re walking home!&#34; <BR> <BR>They continued to fly &#40;a bit faster to Naharud&#39;s pleasure&#41;. Vision had turned into complete blindness. Slowly, Darktalon began to descend. Then, out of no where, something slammed hard into Darktalon&#39;s side. The furious dragon let out a mighty yell of pain and started thrashing about, wildly. Blood gushed from Darktalon&#39;s side. His left wing was shattered.Naharud was shaken off, and the the two began to fall.Then hit ground hard. <BR> <BR>No, not the ground! Naharud felt around, blindly. He was sure of it. Bark! They were in a tree! But something was wrong, the &#39;tree&#39; was moving! THEY were moving! <BR> <BR>&#34;What the-&#34; Naharud gasped as the surface he was on began to close around him like a giant, woody hand grasping a fork. It didn&#39;t take too long to figure out what it was. &#34;A Wood Golem!&#34; Naharud guessed outloud. The gigantic monster kept on walking. Infuriated, the Ripper began yelling at this monsterous creature. &#34;Tell us! Why have you captured us? Where are you taking us?&#34; The titanic beast answered in a slow, monotone voice. You could hear the distink sound of rustling leaves as he spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;You have interfered in Rootwood&#39;s homeland.&#34; the Wood Golem said in a stupid manner. &#34;In his home, you have entered, disturbed the peace. You must face justice.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We have done nothing to your forest!&#34; Naharud defended. <BR> <BR>&#34;Master says different. Master spoke of city dwellers who destryoed forest home.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#39;Master?&#39; Naharud thought to himself. The giant spoke again. <BR> <BR>&#34;If not,then why you here?&#34; Naharud started to retaliate, but stayed quiet for a moment. Should he let their mission be know? Was it a secret? Suddenly, something startled him. THEIR! He hadn&#39;t heard Darktalon since they were hit, obviously by this Wood Golem. He reached his vision out as far as he could in the thick, black smoke. Darktalon was indeed in Rootwood&#39;s other hand, but he wasn&#39;t moving. Naharud prayed that he was only unconcious. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well?&#34; the Wood Golem asked. Reluctantly, Naharud answered. <BR> <BR>&#34;We... we are searching for something.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;If you not here to destroy, then why you hurt Rootwood&#39;s friends?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#39;Friends?&#39; Naharud asked himself silently. Then he remembered Darktalon&#39;s cruelty to the forest worm and zuum at the forest&#39;s entrance. &#34;We were attacked!&#34; he told Rootwood. &#34;We were only defending ourselves.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Why would friends attack you?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;I thought you might be able to tell US that.&#34; Rootwood loosened his grip on the Ripper, but continued to plod along his path. <BR> <BR>&#34;Maybe you tell the truth,&#34; Rootwood said. &#34;But he not sure. Rootwood decide... to let someone else decide.&#34; Naharud thought he had finally gotten somewhere. <BR> <BR>&#34;So are you taking us to this &#39;Master&#39; you spoke of?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No.&#34; Rootwood answered rather abruptly. &#34;Master is powerful, Rootwood respects Master. But wise Master is not. Rootwood has some one else in mind.&#34;  Naharud was intrigued. <BR> <BR>&#34;Who?&#34; he asked. Rootwood seemed to be contemplating whether to answer or not. Finally, he spoke.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Rootwood is taking you to a friend. Please, Rootwood asks you leave it at that.&#34; Naharud nodded. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fair enough.&#34; he said. <BR> <BR>They continued walking for what seemed like an eternity. Naharud could tell that they had left the smoke a long time ago &#40;much to his dismay&#41;, yet the darkness of night still kept his vision at a minimum. Naharud looked at Darktalon, but still could not make out his black figure in the shadows. Rootwood seemed to be able to feel his movement. He answed in kind. <BR> <BR>&#34;He is okay. Rootwood felt him move a few times. Rootwood sorry he hit him so hard.&#34; So Rootwood was the one who knocked them out of the sky. He thought so. <BR> <BR>&#34;It is all right.&#34; Naharud answered. He was glad his companion was not quite dead... yet. <BR> <BR>&#34;We here, now.&#34; Rootwood said. Naharud noticed that they had entered a large, treelsee clearing. The pale light of a full moon shone into his eyes. He could see for the first time in what seemed like ages. Rootwood began lowering his massive arms to the ground. He completely released his grip and opened his hand, letting Naharud go completely free. Naharud was puzzled.He looked around, quizzickly. <BR> <BR>&#34;No one is here.&#34; Naharud realized. <BR> <BR>&#34;You not see her, yet she is watching.&#34; He sat down with a ground shaking thump. <BR> <BR>&#34;She spends her nights in the forest listening, waiting.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t understand.&#34; Naharud said. He hadn&#39;t understood a single word the golem had said. <BR> <BR>&#34;It late. Sleep now. See her in the morning.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You trust me enough to let me free?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Rootwood stay awake. You not pass him easily.&#34; <BR>Naharud suddenly realized that he was extremely tired. He had to trust this enormous monster, for now. He began to nod into sleep. &#34;Goodnight, little one.&#34; Rootwood said. &#34;Morning light choses your fate.&#34;
