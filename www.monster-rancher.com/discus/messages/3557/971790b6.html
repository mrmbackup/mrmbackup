<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:Daeore@hotmail.com>Daeore Dermegil</A></B> on <B>Thursday, January 9, 2003 - 04:04 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 The next morning started with a knock on the door.  Squinting in the mid morning light that had entered the room, I sat up, rubbed my eyes and answered.  &#39;Who is it?&#39; <BR> <BR>It was the innkeeper, sounding sort of worried.  &#39;T-the Mayor, would like to talk to you.  He is waiting downstairs.&#39; <BR> <BR>Thinking back a little, recalling the conversation with the doctor, I remembered he mentioned something like that.  So, standing up, shaking out my legs and stretching, I answered back.  &#39;Give me about five minutes, then send him up please?&#39; <BR> <BR>The innkeeper gave a noise of acknowledgment and I could almost hear him stumble down the steps to give my reply to the Mayor.  I used the next five minutes to check on Angel, who slept soundly with only a slightly labored wheeze, poke Durahan so he would get up and allow entrance into the room, and wash my face with the lukewarm water in the wash bowl.  I was just buttoning up a fresh shirt when another knock sounded at the door, this one sounded confident, not like the quiet &#39;excuse me&#39; knock of the innkeeper. <BR> <BR>Durahan helpfully opened the door, and I looked over to see the Mayor.  A short man, looking like a well dressed blacksmith or something, his thick arms and chest barely held in by an official looking white shirt and tie, with a black overcoat. <BR> <BR>&#39;Hello!&#39;  His voice was almost as solid as his build, not very deep, but confident, used to speaking over noises.  &#39;I hear you used that old shrine near town?&#39; <BR> <BR>I waved a hand to Durahan, &#39;Yes.  I needed to use the shrine to make a monster for a journey.&#39;  I waved the Mayor to sit in the only seat in the room, a wooden chair by a small writing table. <BR> <BR>The Mayor looked over to Durahan, then blinked.  &#39;That&#39;s a Durahan!  Amazing!  I&#39;ve not seen one in a long time.  And only for a few moments as the trainer only passed through town.&#39;  He sat down after a fairly good look at the tall and sturdy Durahan, who looked uncomfortable under the scrutiny. <BR> <BR>&#39;I consider myself lucky.&#39;  I replied.  &#39;I almost broke his disk.  But I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t.&#39;  This made the Mayor look intrigued, and Durahan proud. <BR> <BR>&#39;Well.  I&#39;ll get to the point.&#39;  He said as I sat myself on the bed gently.  &#39;Since the war fifty years ago, this town has been without a shrine.  The old shrine master was killed, and she was said to have put a curse on the shrine.&#39;  He gave me a measuring look, &#39;Since you seem to have the ability to unlock the disks, I, as Mayor, would like you to stay here a while, and run the shrine.&#39; <BR> <BR>I was about to protest, but Angel murmured quietly, and sat up slowly.  Turning I helped her sit up, and the Mayor continued.  &#39;If you accept.  We, the towns people here, will help you restore the shrine, and build you a place to stay for your time here.&#39; <BR> <BR>I turned again after Angel propped herself up against the wall.  &#39;But...  I have something I need to do.  I have to journey...&#39;  I paused as Angel tapped me on the shoulder, and gave me a pleading look.  Not wanting to upset her really, I sighed.  &#39;Okay.&#39;  The Mayor&#39;s face lit up, but I stopped his next words.  &#39;BUT!  I will only stay until you have another temple master replace me.  Or one full year.  What ever is sooner.&#39; <BR> <BR>They Mayor blinked, maybe he was amazed at my resolve for a person so young.  His next words were sort of jumbled, &#39;Well I guess that is acceptable.  A lot can happen in a year.  Agreed then?&#39; <BR> <BR>I nodded, and the Mayor smiled.  &#39;Excellent!  I will let the people know, and we can get things rolling right away, Mr.  ?&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;Mike Rutian.&#39;  I replied, the sudden lie about my real name earned me an alarmed squeeze from Angel&#39;s hand on my shoulder.  I extended my hand with a smile.  &#39;Here&#39;s to the hopeful growth of this town, and an interesting year.&#39; <BR> <BR>He smiled, shook my hand, and left.  Durahan helpfully shut the door, and looked at me with what would have been a really good &#39;stern&#39; look, but he lacked the face for it.  Waiting for the Mayor to leave the inn, his heavy and excited footfalls on the wooden floor of the inn hard to miss, I explained.  &#39;We,&#39; patting Angel&#39;s hand on my shoulder, &#39;just ran away from a very angry village, my father accused of something he didn&#39;t do.  Telling them my real name could bring trouble calling.  If we are going to be here a year, then we have to make sure we are safe, or at least hidden.&#39;  I stood slowly and walked over to Durahan, tapping him on the chest, &#39;They may not even be after me.  But if they are, the longer they are led astray, the longer we have to get ready, right?&#39; <BR> <BR>This got me a squeaky nod from Durahan, and a quiet sigh from Angel.  &#39;But, enough of that.  Looks like we have a busy time in the future.  But!&#39;  I pointed a finger at Angel.  &#39;You are to rest.  Nothing but walking for you.  No flying, lifting or running about.  And you are to eat too.&#39; <BR> <BR>This got a slightly ashamed look out of Angel, but Durahan and myself both gave her a &#39;glare&#39;.  &#39;None of that.  You saved me from getting more than a bump on the head, but you must get better.&#39;  Durahan and I nodded in unison as well. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Breakfast was almost a grand affair.  Angel, being a strict vegetarian ate some sweet mangos common to the area, I had some oatmeal, &#40;that I made Angel try, but this got an &#39;eww&#39; face from her&#41; some toast, &#40;Angel liked this more&#41; and mango juice, &#40;Angel looked puzzled at this, but tried that too.&#41;  Durahan, whom I had no idea what to feed, was treated with a short tour of the inn&#39;s kitchen.  We later found out several things.  He didn&#39;t like sweet things.  Mangos, mango juice and peaches just didn&#39;t suit him at all.  He did like some dried meat, and oatmeal.  Watching him eat was amusing.  After a few demonstrations with a spoon, he managed to get the idea and try it himself.  This exercise made a mess, and warped the spoon into something resembling a very odd hair pin, but he managed to feed himself a reasonable amount of oatmeal.  We also discovered, that he only bent light around him, as the food he ate was not visible in his stomach.  &#40;The thought of that gives me the creeps.&#41; <BR> <BR>After cleaning up the mess, the innkeeper informed us that the room was ours until our new home by the shrine was finished.  He gave me the key, Angel the spare, and Durahan an extra napkin.  He then informed us that the Mayor was waiting, or would be waiting, by the shrine with a small work crew that set out an hour ago while we ate. <BR> <BR>It was interesting how eager this Mayor was.  But I knew well what a shrine will do to a town.  It is almost as important as a coliseum for the actual monster battles, and having either one in or near a town or city boosts local income and the like nearly ten fold.  Understandable I guess. <BR> <BR>On the way out of town, I met the good doctor, who was all smiles at Angel being up and about, and gave her a pair of soft leather sandals.  After a little working of the leather straps, I managed to give a slightly befuddled Angel a functional pair of sandals that wasn&#39;t going to be ruined by her clawed feet, a trademark of all pixie type monsters.  Thanking the doctor, who waved a finger at Angel and told her what I did this morning, we continued on to the shrine. <BR> <BR>The work crew was already there, stomping out the ground near the shrine for a small house foundation. <BR> <BR>After various hellos, how do you do&#39;s, and other such things, the Mayor asked me, &#39;So, Shrine Keeper, what would you like your new home built from?  Sod?  Wood?&#39; <BR> <BR>I looked to the ruined shrine, then to Durahan, and then Durahan&#39;s sword.  &#39;Stone.&#39; <BR> <BR>The Mayor looked at me, then followed the trail of my eyes.  And with a smile, he nodded.  &#39;Stone it is.&#39;  Turning, he walked off to inform the small crew, only three people and himself, of the idea. <BR> <BR>While he did this, I turned to Durahan.  &#39;Noble companion Durahan.  Your training starts today.&#39; <BR> <BR>I took a good look at the shrine.  It was once a very nice looking structure.  A small courtyard, with roman style pillars and brick path, leading to a archway, the keystone marked with the same design as the sacred disks.  The main building from outside was a wonderfully domed affair, smooth white stone, polished to a shine.  I and my companions walked inside, observing writing on the walls of the hallways.  Several small rooms, possibly small bedrooms, or waiting chambers.  A larger room, a library possibly.  And just down the hall from that, the main room, the shrine itself.  Four pillars with the monster heads atop them.  The altar of pure white stone. <BR> <BR>But now.  The altar was nearly covered in debris from the fallen dome of the ceiling.  The walls were etched with claw marks.  The monster pillars smashed to stubs.  The library, I guessed from the blackened bits of rotted wood fell victim to fire.  The small rooms were littered with what might have been bits of furniture.  The halls ringing the outside of the main chamber had partially collapsed, leaving bits open to the sky, or doors outside.  The walkway leading from the courtyard was missing bricks.  The design on the arch&#39;s keystone was almost gone.  And to top it all off, lost disks were all over the place as well. <BR> <BR>Well.  It will take a while, but this will be a proper shrine again. <BR> <BR>Once we were in the shrine&#39;s main chamber, I stood on the altar and looked at Durahan.  &#39;Well, this is where we start.  You may pick.  Help me and the men tote stone out, or, try and cut the stone down into blocks, so we can tote them out faster.&#39; <BR> <BR>Durahan considered this a while, and then with a bold stride, he walked to one of the ruined bits of pillar laying on the floor.  With a bit of foot shuffling for balance, Durahan brought his great sword up, his hands over his head, the point of the sword angled to the floor behind him, and swung.  With a resounding &#42;SHING&#42; the sword passed through the pillar, and part way into the floor.  I smiled as the free bit of pillar rolled away slightly.  Durahan looked proud of himself. <BR> <BR>&#39;Excellent!  Keep going until you think you need some rest.  Angel?  Please get the attention of the Mayor, and get him in here please?&#39; <BR> <BR>And so, with the coordination of the Mayor, his small team, Angel, Durahan and myself, we started to slowly clear out the main room of the temple.  Durahan cut the larger bits into something more manageable, the team and I carried it out, and Angel, still recovering from her broken ribs, carried canteens of water around one at a time.  &#40;She felt left out when I told her to just watch, so I broke down and gave her something to do.&#41; <BR> <BR>Several weeks went by, and finally, the shrine was clear.  While we had cleared the shrine, we still had a lot more left to do.  The rebuilding of the shrine would have to be simplified.  The hallways were still not done, and the outside of the shrine looked horrid still.  The Mayor was still all smiles, and said he might have a sacred disk or two that might help us with the rebuilding, &#39;If your eminence would permit me to own a monster.&#39;  Were his words. <BR> <BR>Of course I was a little skeptical, but it would make things happen faster, provided he had a disk for something fit for this kind of work.  The next day, he brought me a disk, and we took it to the shrine.  I felt a strange feeling in the air.  Not a bad feeling, more like an air of...  Expectation.  This would mark the town&#39;s first monster.  Would mean the beginning of prosperity to come.  At least, we hoped.  We all did.  The Mayor, his little crew of builders, the town, myself.  Hoped for a brighter future.   <BR> <BR>The disk turned out to be a Plant.  As personal preference goes, I never really liked them.  They were either cheerful, or gloomy, no real middle ground unless they were sleepy.  But the Mayor and his men were still happy, as the three flowered walking garden was released.  The Mayor immediately called it a day off, and the men went to enjoy the company of this new monster. <BR> <BR>It was about two weeks later, when the Plant returned to the work site.  The Mayor and his men used the Plant  to hand them tools from a box, help get little bits of things cleaned up, and generally do light work, well suited to the Plant&#39;s vine like arms.  Durahan was still cutting up stone in the hallway around the main shrine. <BR> <BR>Things progressed.  Weeks later, Angel was recovered, her ribs mended, &#40;and on a whim, I tickled them and yes, ticklish too.&#41; And her feathery wings whole again as well, though she had gotten used to walking, she enjoyed her first fly around the shrine grounds immensely.  Things were shaping up nicely now.  The small house was done, and looked like it could take nearly a century of harsh weather.  The shrine was completely cleared, and looked almost as I pictured it would.  The ceiling and walls still needed reworking, but still, the almost tomblike feeling that hung around the place was gone now, the only sad reminders were the lost disks, the claw marks in the stone, and the huge hole in the once grand domed ceiling. <BR> <BR>Another monster joined our ranks, a hard working Golem.  We found his disk under a rock in the ruined library, and the senior worker under the Mayor laid claim to him.  Golems are huge, strong as titan&#39;s but have a surprising capacity for kindness and gentility.  Chris, the new owner, was a hard working and jovial fellow, so we all knew he would be a good owner for the young Golem.  A short time after, the once grand dome of the shrine was remade, but this time out of the bricks from the front walk.  We all got a bit of a laugh out of that, &#39;What we walked on yesterday, covers our heads today, and for a good long time I hope!&#39;  Said the Mayor when, with the help of the Plant, standing on Durahan, standing on Golem, we put the last stone in place. <BR> <BR>Finally it was done.  It was not as grand as days long gone, having no furnishings, no ornate pillars, no polish.  But it was water proof, and patched up, and looked as if it would stand up to the elements as it once did fifty years ago. <BR> <BR>The reopening of the shrine, also happened to be my birthday, though only Angel and Durahan knew.  And in our little stone house, we had a little party.  I wasn&#39;t all cheer, the back of my mind still focused on the final goal, to find out what my father thought was so important.  But, I had a promise to keep, and a little over eight months left to live in this small town.  The town itself seemed to have grown a little while we worked, not by much, only a couple of sod huts and a mostly completed log cabin evolved into being while the temple was being restored, but it was a noticeable start. <BR> <BR>---- <BR> <BR>Huzzah!  Please, comments?  Anything?

 Thank you for using spell check &#40;or having excellent spelling&#41;. It&#39;s always awful when someone writes a huge long thing and has spelling problems all over the place. Keep it coming.

 Keep going Daeore Dermegil! It&#39;s extremely good. I don&#39;t mean to sound desperate, but try and post the next chapter soon! I think this story really has something going for it. Your story is so captivating and well-written that I feel as if the entire story is real and I am right there watching it all happen. Now that&#39;s what a story SHOULD do. Keep up the good work!

 While not to brag, that was the whole point of the style I&#39;m trying.  Instead of a &#39;read it when it happens&#39; as is standard, I&#39;m working it as a sort of &#39;flash back sequence.&#39;  All in the past tence, with little side notes from the main character. <BR> <BR>But thank you for your comment.  Sorry about the delay too, been busy.  &#40;I work sunday monday tuesday and about all I do is check email when I got home.&#41;
