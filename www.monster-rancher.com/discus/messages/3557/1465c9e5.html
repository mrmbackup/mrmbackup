 Chapter 16:The Dark Illusion, Moo vs. Jakira <BR> <BR>At Jakira&#39;s command the swarm of minions sped forward in a crazed fury of bloodlust. A few naga&#39;s and Terror dogs that still remained in the grand chamber hurled themselves into battle, to protect their master. Moo watched on as the mutants sliced through the ranks of his soldier like a hot wind. What type of sick mind could have conceived such beasts? They were totally mindless, drones meant only to engage in battle and nothing more. The minions continued the charge, after leaving a river of blood behind them. The evil Dragon stood his ground. The short ones, whom sported machine like features, attacked first. Light shifted around their forms, rendering them invisible. They leaped up upon Moo, tearing and scratching with long talons. Moo roared in anger before tearing them off one by one and crushing them underfoot like ticks. Upon death, their vile bodies reappeared, but as they did the second wave came upon him. A legion of flying creatures came in from the open hole above and sped toward him. Moo opened his huge maw and a stream of flame surged forth, burning the creatures to death instantly. As their charred bodies fell to the floor, the lilim Jakira stood there clapping, mocking Moo&#39;s victory. <BR> <BR>&#34;That was very impressive,&#34;She smiled wickedly&#34;You fight well against mindless drones but playtimes over Moo.....It&#39;s MY turn.&#34; <BR> <BR>At this the dragon couldn&#39;t help but laugh and laugh hard. One lilim hardly seemed a threat, who was this woman to think she had any chance at all. Jakira didn&#39;t take well to begin laughed at, the smile dropped from her face and she became as serious as death. Her hand touched the symbol that hung around her neck, the single eye. A huge scythe materialized in her hands, massive and jagged. Moo sensed a powerful energy now, coming from the scythe or perhaps from the symbol itself...he began to wonder weather this was an opponent he should take seriously. <BR> <BR>&#34;Run back to your Master,&#34;Moo snarled, unfurling his black wings to appear as intimidating as ever.&#34;You are hardly a match for me....unless your suicidal that is.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t flatter yourself!&#34;Jakira screamed, her voice was different, Moo could her the sound of thousands of devoured souls behind her voice. What they screamed he couldn&#39;t tell, maybe they cheered him on, to kill this creature that consumed them. He knew little about lilim&#39;s, but he&#39;d found a rumor long ago that said this breed at on time feed on human souls regularly, as a means to increase their own power.... <BR> <BR>&#34;Fine, since you enjoy death so much...&#34;Moo said&#34;Allow me to send you to yours!&#34; The dragon stepped forward, raising his fists high overhead. He then slammed his fists to the ground, a wall of flame erupted from the floor and surged toward Jakira. The lilim grabbed her scythe with both hands and began to twirl it in front of her, creating a black shield of energy. The flame struck the shield which absorbed the fire instantly. Moo then watched as the shield condense into an orb and leaped into her hand. <BR> <BR>&#34;I believe this is yours!&#34;She yelled, hurling the orb through the air. It exploded suddenly, the wall of flame reappeared and this time it was headed straight for Moo. There was no time to dodge the fire, the dragons wings wrapped around his massive body as the flame hit, protecting moo from it&#39;s destructive flame. His wings unfurled, and Moo saw Jakira holding an sphere of death energy which she hurled at him as well. Moo roared, his voice shaking the entire fortress, it was time to get serious. He backhanded the orb as though it was a pesky insect and it sailed into the ceiling, creating another hole. He charged, coming at the lilim with the momentum of a freight train. <BR> <BR>&#34;Death Energy!&#34;She screamed as he charged, the wirling shards of energy sliced into him, cinging his gray fur. But that didn&#39;t stop the charging dragon. He swiped a huge claw her and missed, Moo swiped again and failed to strike the agile lilim. She was very fast, dodging his attack with some ease before unleashing a lightening bolt. Moo roared once again, more angry then hurt, he would end this now! Moo&#39;s hand shot up suddenly, with such quickness the lilim had no chance to avoid. As Jakira struggled for her life Moo slammed her against the wall, creating a deep imprint. Jakira was as unused to feeling pain as Moo was, but unlike the muscular dragon she had a big problem taking it. Moo laughed out loud, his opponent looked as though she&#39;d faint in his hand. Without hesitation, he turned and hurled her violently to the floor. The lilim skid for a few seconds before coming to a dead halt, she didn&#39;t move.... <BR> <BR>He waited a minute before advancing upon the fallen monster. She still didn&#39;t move, the only sign that she was still alive was the gentle rise and fall of her breast. She still breathed, but not for long. Moo took his sweet time approaching her, wondering the best way to finish her off, so many gruesome choices...She looked up at him with a helpless expression. Moo had decided on burning her alive, one of his favorite ways to kill an enemy, few were more painful and agonizing. But as Moo opens his gaping jaws, fire swirling in his throat, he suddenly notice a small sphere of energy collect in Jakira&#39;s palm. Before he could react she hurled it upward, right into his mouth. It exploded, sending the dragon reeling with pain such as he&#39;d never felt. It was hardly enough to kill him, but the blast had scared his throat and hurt like hell. As Moo coughed up blood, the lilim retreated through the hole in the ceiling. <BR> <BR>Moo realized his mistake, he&#39;d gone too easy on his opponent, underestimated her. How dare she make a fool of the great Moo! A smoldering fire came to the dragons eyes as he looked up, she was not going to escape alive. He flapped his massive wings and took to the air. Outside his fortress the airal war continued, his dread wings fought a losing battle against the Masters minions. The flying Zilla transports were ferrying more troops over into his base, carnage filled the sky, but where was Jakira? Suddenly one of the hideous transports rammed into Moo, the dragon turned enrage. Swooping beneath the creature he tore it&#39;s stomach open with his talon. Dozens of minions feel to their dooms along with the beast itself. Suddenly a group of bladed flying minions attacked, Moo tried to breath fire upon them but the pain in his throat was to great. He took a second to curse his own stupidity , before bringing his talons to bear, he&#39;d do it the old fashioned way if he had too. Then, the charging minions suddenly broke off their attack, before moo could figure out what happened a burning agony engulfed the right side of his body. Jakira had snuck up behind him and slashed his right wing with her scythe. Unable to remain airborne, moo plummeted, grabbing hold of an ebony spire protruding from his fortress. Jakira hovered nearby as he pulled himself up, laughing. <BR> <BR>&#34;Who have thought the great Moo would be so easy to defeat!&#34;She laughed insanly&#34;By the way, what kind of name is Moo?? Am I talking to a dragon or a cow!?&#34; <BR> <BR>That was the final insult, Moo&#39;s anger had reached the boiling point. With agility no other dragon could possibly muster, Moo leaped into the sky. He punch Jakira in the stomach, her soft body folding over his fist. Then with the other hand slashed her across the face and torso. He laughed to himself before throwing her downward, crashing back into his main chamber. She smashed into the stone floor, hard. Moo then pushed aside the incredible pain in his throat, summoning a huge fireball that he launched it at her, creating a great explosion. The entire act took a few seconds, and Moo quickly found himself falling. He landed on his feet, not far from where his enemy had landed, leaving two footprints 6 inches deep. As the smoke cleared he wandered over to his opponent, to see the results of his handiwork. <BR> <BR>Jakira lay in a small crater, still alive and conscious but badly injured. Long claw marks were slashed across her body, two on the left side of her face. She looked up at him, to hurt to give moo so much as a hateful glare. The lilim had never felt so much pain, she felt broken in every possible way. Feeling as though she&#39;d black out any moment the lilim wondered why only she was sent to face Moo, she could have used the help right then. But still, she had one last trick to employ.... <BR> <BR>Moo was becoming quiet full of himself, seeing his enemy battered before him. He moved in for the kill, he wanted very much to enjoy this. Suddenly he stopped, hearing the voice of one of his servants. It was the weed that manned the command console. He&#39;d been hiding somewhere and had left his post. <BR> <BR>&#34;Y-you were wonderful master Moo!&#34;The weed cheered, but Moo wasn&#39;t in the mood. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why aren&#39;t you doing something!?&#34;Moo snarled&#34;You are supposed to be monitoring the status of my fortress. I should kill you for your cowards.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;M-m-master.....&#34;The Weed pointed at something behind Moo. The dragon turned and was shocked to see the lilim standing. She had somehow managed to climb to her feet. She grasped the symbol around her neck with both hands. A black aura began to surround her body, it appeared to give her even more strength. <BR> <BR>&#34;Time to die Moo!!&#34;She screamed&#34;Dark Illusion!&#34;  <BR> <BR>A haze of purple and black exploded from the pendant and filled the chamber in a matter of seconds. Everything went black, it was deathly silent. Moo felt as is he&#39;d stumbled into oblivion itself. He was surrounded by nothingness, no light, no sound, just an endless black void that stretched out forever in every conceivable direction. A moment later something did invade his mind, the voice of Jakira. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hello Moo,&#34;She said&#34;Welcome, to my world!&#34; Suddenly Moo was falling, as though the floor was suddenly disappeared. He glanced down as he fell, an ocean of jagged spikes rose from the darkness. The dragon tried desperately to grab hold of something, anything, while trying to flap his injured wing. By sheer luck his claw grabbed hold of something, an invisible ledge. He pulled himself up, the laughter of Jakira echoing in his mind. <BR> <BR>&#34;This,&#34;He said, coming to a strange realization.&#34;Is only an illusion. It can do no harm to me...Is this the best you can do??&#34; Jakira answered the question instantly and Moo found himself floating...in outerspace! This didn&#39;t feel like any illusion, he felt weightless, the stars around him seemed so real, he could feel the heat of the sun on his fur. <BR> <BR>&#34;You&#39;d be surprised how real an illusion can seem, your mind will make it real.&#34;Jakira laughed in his mind.&#34;Oh, and did I mention...there&#39;s no air in space.&#34; And as the words invaded his mind Moo began to choke, and as he suffocated the heat from the sun became hotter. But it wasn&#39;t really becoming hotter, the star itself was moving closer at an accelerated rate. Moo cast about in desperation, he wondered what would kill him first, the lack of air or the burning inferno that was moving his way. He lashed out in every way he could, attacking the nothingness of space as though it might tear a hole back into the real world. But the problem was, he already begun to believe, to believe that this really was space which was why he couldn&#39;t breath. He believed that the sun was hurtling himself toward him. Fear and panic gripped his dark heart, emotions he&#39;d rarely felt in his entire existence. Death seemed imitate, there was no escape from the Dark illusion. But suddenly it dawned on the dragon, this WAS an illusion. Very few would have had the strength of will to realized that simple fact, while being strangled with an approaching sun ready to fire them. That was the power of the dark illusion, most would have been so consumed with fear they&#39;d never realize their own minds were what was killing them. Upon Moo&#39;s realization the dark reality shattered, he was back in his chamber....  <BR> <BR>&#34;Jakira....&#34;Moo snarled. The lilim stood about ten feet away, her strength drained from the last attack. She stood dumbfounded, scarcely able to believe that anyone could escape her control, and yet Moo had broken her Dark Illusion which no one had ever done before. Suddenly a surge of energy empowered the dragon. Energy collected in his chest, moving up into his throat. At last, Moo unleashed a beam of power onto Jakira, who tried to use her wings to shield herself. Somehow the lilim held on as the raw energy washed over her body. Finally, Moo ceased his attack, unable to stand the pain any longer. Jakira was still standing, her wings unfurled and fell limply to her sides. <BR> <BR>&#34;B-bastard....&#34;She spoke before her eyes rolled up into her head. The lilim collapsed to the floor unconscious and defeated at last. Her left wing twitched a few times before going still.... <BR> <BR>Moo wasted no time gloating over his victory, it was time for this lilim to die. He charged, but again his plans were spoiled...Through the ceiling a huge black form came crashing down, landing between the dragon and his helpless prey. It was a Jaggernaut, Moo stopped in alarm sensing the ungodly amount of power emanated from the monster. The beast made no effort to attack, instead it turned to pick up Jakira. Moo used the opportunity to assault the creature, after all, who would be so arrogant as to turn their back on the great Moo? But the Jaggernaut proved faster then Moo could have imagined, turning and slashing the dragon across the chest with his horn. <BR> <BR>&#34;What is your rush?&#34;Darklon said in his deep, brooding voice.&#34;You will die soon enough...&#34; With that the creatures wings shot out and it took flight, taking Jakira with it. Moo started to persue but thought better of it, coughing up some more blood. <BR> <BR>&#34;Um, do you need a cough drop sir?&#34;The Weed asked, Moo gave him a strange look. <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t they use plant leaves in thoughs?&#34;Moo said almost smiling. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well yes but...w-what?&#34;The weed said neverously, suddenly the dragon lunged at him, not giving his servant any time to scream. He gulped the weed down in two bites. Strangely enough, his throat did feel a little better. But then something else caught moo&#39;s attention...he looked out at the battle being waged between the master and his forces. More of his dragons had deployed, and more were begin cut down, the hideous transports continued to bring on hostile boarders, but they were the least of his problems. The Dark Raven itself was charging for another cry, this one even greater then the last... <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Talus...&#34;Shielka said as one who she once called a friend emerged from the shadows. Beatdown had her furry fists raised for a fight, Stone claw stood in considerable pain.&#34;What are you doing here? Are you here to stop us??&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No, it was I who overrided the lock and let you in here.&#34;Talus said&#34;Once again I&#39;m never appreciated. As for your Trident, thoughs wounds will heal.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Then your on our side!&#34;Beatdown jumped up and down with happiness.&#34;Yeah, now we can get outta here no problem!&#34; Shielka didn&#39;t seem to trust Talus, as far as she was concerned he&#39;s already betrayed her. Stone claw watched on, trying his best to forget the pain and remain alert. He was intent on not letting the others know how much he suffered. The gaia was right, the wound would heal, but until then he was very vulnerable, plus it hurt like all hell. <BR> <BR>&#34;No I&#39;m not on your side.&#34;Talus said coldly and beatdown stopped, putting her fists up again.&#34;Listen Shielka, give yourself up. The escape hatches have been sealed, even I couldn&#39;t open them. If you beg for forgiveness the master may not have you killed. As for these to, perhaps I can convice the master to give them a less painful demise. It&#39;s really the best choice, the only alternative is slow torture and an agonizing death. Please shielka, I&#39;d rather not have to see you killed that way....&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;So what your saying is,&#34;Shielka said solomly&#34;There&#39;s no way out? I&#39;m sorry you two, I told you this might not work.....&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;B-but I don&#39;t wanna die.&#34;Beatdown said with tears in her eyes.&#34;I want to see my trainer again...but not yet. I wanted to get Stone claw and Justice back together first......&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, give it up.&#34;Talus said&#34;You never had any chance against the Master from the very beginning. Now I&#39;ll contact my breathen to pick you three up, please don&#39;t resist.&#34; The gaia raised a device to his head and was about to speak into it when Stone claw swiped it from his grip, and destroyed it. <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s not over...&#34;He said through his pain.&#34;We might die in here, but we&#39;re taken this ship down with us!&#34; Talus reached for a gun that rested on a nearby crate. With frightening quickness Claw slashed his metal arm off. Beatdown joined in, smashing his knees. Shielka picked up the machine gun and aimed the weapon at Talus&#39;s jeweled lens. <BR> <BR>&#34;You show me how to work one of these remember?&#34;She said&#34;Now tell me, can I get to the generator from here?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, three levels down the hatch.&#34;Talus said before adding.&#34;You can&#39;t make it though, with the ship on read alert that area is one big death trap. I should know since I designed it and my work was impeccable! Funny, I can&#39;t believe you are really the young daina I once knew.&#34; <BR> <BR>Shielka turned away and began searching for the hatch. Stone claw wondered why she&#39;d not blown his processor out. He would have killed Talus himself but didn&#39;t want to denie her vengeance, whenever she chose to take it. After a few minute Shielka had found the hatch. Stone claw looked down into the dark passage. If they couldn&#39;t escape then they&#39;d do their best to take the Master down as well. It was a wild chance, he was injured and the generator sounded far away and well guarded. But it was a chance they&#39;d take.....
