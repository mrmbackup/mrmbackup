 The first thing most monsters hear is their own heartbeat. A steady thump that is the most comforting sound to all monsters. Humans have the blessing of the scent and sound of their mothers but monsters being created either through written words, disk stones or a combination of their &#34;parents&#34; have no such luck.  <BR> <BR>Thump...Thump....Thump  <BR> <BR>The eye of the newly created monster slowly opened. Light sprung into his eye and a bright red eye lid immediately covered it again. Slowly another eye opened and this time stayed open as a shape came into focus. The shape was a teenage boy. His name was Namis. Namis was tall, medium build with long black hair. His face showed a look of happiness and intrigue.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Hello.....hmmm...&#34; Namis stuttered. He turned to face the lab assistant.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I would like to name him Leo please&#34;. Namis said.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Very well, i&#39;ll register him with that name.&#34;  <BR> <BR>The lab assistant disappeared behind a pair of double doors and Namis turned to face his monster.  <BR> <BR>Leo was an antlan. He was not a regular antlan however. Where the pure breed had dark, sea blue, Leo had a burning and piercing red and instead of golden horns his horns was a deep purple. He was a Guardian, an antlant with the sub breed of a garu. He slowly stood up on tiny red feet, his eyes still slightly adjusting, and beamed a smile at his owner. His teeth were blinding white, sharp and neatly set out despite him being only a few seconds old. Namis smiled back and placed a hand on top of his monster&#39;s head.  The creature bobbed slightly under his master&#39;s weight and then straightened himself to full height again.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Thanks&#34; Namis shouted thought he double doors, &#34;Come on Leo, we are going to the ranch, you&#39;re new home now.&#34; <BR> <BR>Leo did a tiny summersault and smiled at his master. <BR> <BR>Namis&#39;s ranch had been a departing gift from his grandfather.  His grandfather had been a very talented monster breeder and from an early age Namis had been interested in all the different aspects of monster breeding.  Neither of his parents showed any interest or talent in raising, breeding or fighting monsters but encouraged Namis&#39;s gift by taking him to many public tournaments and letting him stay with his grandfather often. <BR> <BR>Leo grew in talent and age.  By the age of three he had already beaten A rank and was well recognised within the monster world.  His horns were now a deep, dark purple, his skin was tough and almost scaled and he now boasted a collection of 10 official attacks and several ones Namis had invented.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok I know its a little boring but we need to keep practising you&#39;re new attacks for the S grade.  Apparently Lanis is going to be there.&#34;  <BR> <BR>The monster he was referring to was infamous.  Lanis was a legend, not because of his skills, although they were quite impressive, but because of the things he did.  These included teaching small classes of young monsters, performing tricks on command and doing intricate and amazing taunts and stage acts when he was winning a match. <BR> <BR>&#34;We need to beat him, so keep it up.&#34; Namis mouthed as he stepped back giving Leo some room. <BR> <BR>Leo was standing in the field that Namis had made for training monsters. Before him was a tree trunk which Namis had placed around a tall lump of granite extracted from the mines nearby.  The idea was that the tree trunk was sturdy, stayed upright and had a few thick, short branches that represented different parts of an enemy&#39;s body. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok when I shout the name of an attack I want you to do it as quickly as possible. Ready? Ok...Spiral Dive!&#34; Shouted Namis. <BR> <BR>Leo leapt forward onto his hand.  His legs rolled over so that they were at a 45% angle with the ground and facing the tree trunk.  Leo sprung off his hands and instantly span into a cyclone with his feet pointed and his claw out.  He hit the tree with his spinning feet, swooped over then slashed it with a cycle of slash attacks.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Good.....now Antler combo!&#34; <BR> <BR>Leo ran head first towards the &#34;enemy&#34; and slammed his hard purple antlers either side of the trunk. With a grunt of effort he forced the trunk up about two meters before pulling away and slamming it downwards with both fists.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Good job....now...&#34; <BR> <BR>Before Namis could finish the sentence a deep buzzer went off meaning it was time for the S Grade official tournament that would see him become truly recognised.   <BR> <BR>The tournaments were held within colossal stadiums like those of the ancient gladiatorial games. On the way to the trainer room &#40;the rooms in which competing trainers were isolated and waited to go into battle&#41; Namis saw the figure he was dreading most of all.  Lanis. <BR> <BR>The tournament was of the round robin type with 6 competitors entering.  This meant that each of the monsters fought every other monster and the one with the most wins at the end came first.  It was the most common of tournaments and Leo had been in dozens over his life.  <BR> <BR>Leo&#39;s first four matches were easy.  They were against monsters that had probably only just reached A rank, and whose breeders had gotten slightly over confident with the fame and publicity that came with it.  With Namis on the sidelines Leo got in with four KO&#39;s and did exactly as his master commanded.  He dived, clawed, kicked, span, jumped and ducked his way past the opponents and was confident until he saw the scoreboard before his final match.  Just below his name was the name of &#34;Lanis&#34;.  Lanis too had four circles opposite his name and the announcer told the massive audience that this match was the decider for who came second and who made it to the big four and who stayed at this rank for at least another three months.  The crowd cheered a defining cheer that could only be associated with a high-grade monster tournament or the gladiatorial matches of ancient Rome.  Leo walked onto the field to the cheers of the audience and did a small bow which was always a crowd pleaser.  The cheering died down a little as they waited for Lanis to make his appearance, it was obvious to Leo that this was going to be quite close and exciting and he realised that the crowd were expecting this too.  Slowly the roar of voices built up again as Lanis marched onto the field. <BR> <BR>Lanis was an unusually large hare.  Rumour was that there had been some shady goings on in the lab when he had been created but the fact was that he just had some weird ancestry and both his &#34;parents&#34; were rather large.  He was different from a normal hare though.  His fur was a deep sea blue in some places and went to a lighter sky blue in others.  Other parts of him were totally white in colour.  His fur was also a different texture to that of a normal hare, it was smoother and a lot softer, similar to that of a mew or tiger.  Lanis was a spearmint, a hare crossbred with the blood of the deep sea monsters, Lesiones. <BR> <BR>Lanis waved once more with his huge fists then hopped to the starting mark, Leo waited a few seconds, sizing up the speed of his opponent before stepping up to his own mark.  A silence fell upon the watching crowd as they awaited the three whistle blows signalling the start of a match.   <BR> <BR>The whistle blew two long shrieks into the air that ricocheted off the arena walls and then a single short burst. Leo fell back straight away predicting that Lanis would launch an attack the instant the final whistle had blown, he had been right.  A deep blue flash rocketed into the space that had previously been occupied by Leo&#39;s body.  Lanis has obviously been expecting to make contact with the first hit, his body fell into the sand and a light dust sprung up as he landed hard on his stomach.   Leo sprung forward to take advantage of the downed hare.  He took a long step onto Lanis&#39;s back, hopped on one powerful leg and then brought both his fists down in a hammer blow to his back.  Lanis shook with the power of the attack and let out a light yelp as he did a backwards roll and hopped to his feet.  The two monsters bobbed backwards and forward rhythmically, waiting to attack but also trying to predict the enemy to.  Eventually it was Leo who broke the pattern. With his hands engulfed in flame he darted forward launching a powerful fire punch.  His claws were visible through the dancing flames but the main focus of the attack was the burning element.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t dodge it!&#34; Lanis&#39;s trainer shouted. <BR> <BR>As his master shouted, Lanis brought both fists up to his face, thus protecting his body with his strong arms.  The fire punch slammed into these arms and pushed Lanis several feet backwards.   <BR> <BR>Leo&#39;s idea had been to put Lanis on the defence with a week attack so that he could then hit him with a flying kick or powerful claw attack.  Lanis&#39;s trainer had guessed what he was up to straight away and directed his monster accordingly.  Now the giant blue hare stood a few feet away and ready to attack whilst Leo was still recovering from his attempted attack.  Lanis took the chance to attack and launched a combo of powerful kicks and punches that knocked Leo to the ground.  Leo hurt all over, he knew he wouldn’t last much longer at the rate the battle was going.  He opened one red eye to see his opponent dancing around the arena with only one eye on him.  This might just be the flaw that could win him the match and he knew it would be risky.   <BR> <BR>Namis shouted to Leo to get up but he didn’t seem to be able to hear him.  He reached into his pocket and pointed a compass like machine at Leo&#39;s frozen body.  The machine was a monster identifier.  It could tell you the statistics of any monster that it was pointed at.  Not only did it show the breed, sub breed, estimated age and such but it also listed the life of the monster.  Namis was surprised to see his monster that appeared to be knocked out, still had 79 points of life in him.  He smiled as he saw Lanis dancing about playing to the cheering crowd, he could guess what Leo was up to. <BR> <BR>Leo opened his eye a tiny fraction once more to notice Lanis was only two or three feet away and not paying any attention to him.  He could also see the officials checking their watched and reaching for the whistle that would end the match.  Leo had no time left to wait and sprung up in a single flick of his body.  Lanis had no idea he had gotten up despite the great shouting of the crowd and continued to jump from foot to foot with his hands raised in the air.  In the corner of his eye he saw two balls of flame ignite.   <BR> <BR>Leo ran at the hare with his claws ablaze.  What followed was the most intricate and complicated combination of slashes that most of the audience had ever seen.  Leo&#39;s claws swung left and right and trails of flame followed them ripping and tearing at the blue fur, clotting it with blood.  Only after seven slashes Lanis&#39;s trainer blew his own whistle, which declared he had surrendered.  Leo stopped instantly and caught the hare&#39;s falling body.  Lanis was out cold; his eyes were glazed and looked confused.  The roar of the crowd came up again and engulfed Leo and Namis in a tidal wave of sound. <BR> <BR>And though this part of the story is a great triumph, we are still only a tiny way into the final story itself, for you see, nobody in that arena knew what was to happen to Leo in the future.
