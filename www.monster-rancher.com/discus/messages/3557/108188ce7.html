 The day before had been a tiring day, for both my monsters and me. We finally found our way through that accursed forest, and spotted the road that went around it. This road was heavily traversed upon, and many merchants and travelers saw me emerge from the dense woods. They gawked at me as I joined them on the path. It was terribly unnerving. The only thing I could hear was the rustling of leaves, that is, until a seemingly well off merchant approached me and, in a very thick Scottish accent said, “Oi there wee one!” he was about seven feet, a complete giant compared to me. He was taller than the Raiden that was pulling his cart. “Mah name is Shamus McSkyburg. Please’d to meet yeh. I see that ya have come oot off that dark and dangerous farst there. That be a very brave thang to do. How did you come about completin’ this tall feet?” <BR> <BR>“Well, uh, just went through it, I guess,” I really didn’t feel like relating what had really happened. <BR> <BR>“Oh, that’s it, eh? I get the feelin’ somteeng mor ‘appened. Hey, why doon’t I give ya and yer monstars there a lift. Youse lookin’ like yeh can use it.” I didn’t really know what to do. I wondered whether to trust him and take the offer, or go walk away. I was beat, and monsters were even worse, so I decided to take a chance and accept his offer.  <BR> <BR>“Um… thanks. My monsters could use the rest. By the way, my name is James Nottap.” <BR> <BR>“Please’d ta meetcha Jammis” I think that his accent prevented him from pronouncing my name correctly. At least he doesn’t do it on purpose, like the Shrine keeper back home did. Thinking back to my carefree days as Thomas’s assistant made me quite homesick. Much to my dismay, Shamus noticed. <BR> <BR>“Ack! What’s the matter wee one?” He had eyes that just bore into your soul, seeing every bit of you as you really were. He felt so trusting. I then preceded to tell him everything that has happened up to that very moment: Thomas leaving, Gitan and Stefioni, the tournament, Jacques, being saved by Kari, going into the forest and being confronted my that maniac, and meeting him on the merchant’s road.  <BR> <BR>When I had finished, Shamus just nodded. “Ka-ree…. hm. Oh! I know that name! She bought a few supplies from meh, and told meh ta look oot for a wee boy and his two very odd monsters, and to help him on his way to Hyander. Lucky for her that is where I was goin’ and in sooch a ganeroos mood.” He winked at me. I knew I had found someone to trust. I had become a bit weary about people during my travels. I began to think back to the others: Thomas, Hannah, Gavin, and Kari. I wondered where they were at that moment… <BR> <BR> <BR>well. HEre is part IX in all of it&#39;s &#34;glory&#34;. Sorry it is so sort. I&#39;m in a transition in my story right now, and well, you&#39;ll see what happens
