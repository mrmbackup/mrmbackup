 I had a dream that night.  I forget the details, as most people do, but the dream kept coming back to one point, and the next morning, that point stood out as the rest of the dream was pushed back and overtaken by the waking world.  The cave. The cave where the Dean had been living.  Some thing was there.  Or at least, that&#39;s what my dream was telling me.  Considering the only dreams that had not been prophetic in nature had been nightmares, I took it as a sign. <BR> <BR>&#39;Sarah, Angel, Zan.&#39;  I said as we packed our things and made ready to set out, away from this burnt husk of a village.  &#39;Some thing is bothering me.&#39; <BR> <BR>Sarah looked up from her packing, &#39;Oh?  Like this entire situation isn&#39;t?&#39;  An obvious edge of stress in her voice.  Angel patted her on the shoulder sympathetically. <BR> <BR>&#39;The cave.  I think some thing is there again.&#39;  I reached my right arm to touch my left shoulder, &#39;A hunch I guess.  It&#39;s not far out of our way, so I think we should look.&#39; <BR> <BR>So, that&#39;s where we headed.  It was a little south from where our original path started, but it wasn&#39;t too much of a trek.  Fond memories, and sad remembrances of Durahan&#39;s first fight with the Dean were still carved into the small clearing around the cave.  The small ditch he dug when he was backhanded.  Cut trees, uprooted stumps.  Even a few full sized hand prints left in solid wood or stone as I replayed the battle in my mind, I could see the Dean making these terrible wounds in the living earth as Durahan danced away as best he could.  And there, at the far end of the clearing by the cave, stood the Dean&#39;s final marker, a lost disk.  The man-monster experiment gone insane, was just a monster in the end. <BR> <BR>&#39;He knew what you were.  Didn&#39;t he?&#39;  I asked Angel, as we stood next to the lost disk.  Her only reply was a nod, as she traced a finger over the surface of the disk. <BR> <BR>I felt Zan move.  His aura of presence going from neutral to alert.  We all turned, looking at the mouth of the cave.  Geoff was there, bow at the ready, arrow pulled back to his ear.  The look in his eyes as he faced down Zan was half crazed, his cheeks bright red with what was most likely fever. <BR> <BR>&#39;Another monster eh?&#39; He started obviously not recognizing us.  &#39;Back of you beast or I&#39;ll put an arrow through your eye!&#39; <BR> <BR>Geoff had a sudden wild look in his eyes, and I could feel Zan getting ready to move, a frightening aura growing from him.  &#39;ZAN!&#39; I shouted suddenly, making sure he heard me.  &#39;Stand down.&#39;  I walked forward to stand beside Zan, Sarah standing just behind and to my right.  &#39;Geoff!  Don&#39;t you recognize me?  It&#39;s me!  Miki!&#39;  I heard Sarah mumble a warning of &#39;fever dreams&#39; as I attempted to talk the old hunter down. <BR> <BR>Geoff looked a little like a frightened animal for an instant, then blinked, letting his aim relax.  &#39;Miki?  Is that you?&#39;  His voice was rambling, the end of his proverbial rope coming up fast.  &#39;They came, a week ago, a man, and dragons, and fire and they killed almost everyone, some fled some were taken away, I hid here, yes, here in this cave and...&#39;  And with that, he passed out. <BR> <BR>As best I could, I hefted the man up into my arms and carried him into the cave, what we found surprised us.  Another hunter, already overtaken by fever it seemed, a child and her mom, also looking quite ill, but better than Geoff and the other hunter. <BR> <BR>Sarah and Angel started to tend and talk to the mother and daughter, while I set Geoff down next to the other hunter.  At a nod Zan went to stand guard, and I joined Sarah and Angel with the other two. <BR> <BR>&#39;...just appeared out of the sky.&#39;  The mother was talking to Sarah as Angel fussed over the child, getting things from her pack, &#39;From the east.  Three red dragons, and one blue one.&#39;  The lady was getting weaker in her speech, lack of sleep I guessed.  &#39;The blue one, had a man on it&#39;s back.  I didn&#39;t get a name, we were already running, fire everywhere...  He...  Was missing some of his ear...  Scar on his cheek.&#39;  Making less sense now, but we didn&#39;t stop her, &#39;everything burning, but, we escaped, Geoff led husband and myself here, with her.  Foul smoke from the dragons.  Fever, no sleep...&#39;  Finally she became completely incoherent, and Sarah hushed her, gently pushing her down on the crude bedding she was sitting on. <BR> <BR>Angel was still fussing with the child, who looked weak, but not as bad as the adults.  Already she had made a small fire and was setting some water to boil on it.  I however, was starting to twitch.  I could feel myself getting very angry.  &#39;It was him.&#39; <BR> <BR>Sarah nodded, rummaging in her own pack for some thing.  &#39;And it seems they used poison too.  This fever is not from a cold, these people are used to such things.  This had to have happened recently, a day or two, maybe three.&#39;  More rummaging, &#39;I&#39;ve seen these symptoms before.  Fever, not able to sleep properly, more harmful to adults.&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;How bad is it?&#39;  I asked, looking for things to feed the small fire, before Zan looked to what I was doing, and left the cave.  &#39;Can you cure them?&#39; <BR> <BR>Sarah sighed quietly, &#39;I don&#39;t have the means for the proper antidote.  But I can speed recovery, if it isn&#39;t too late.  Left too long it can be lethal, the body unable to rest simply gives out.&#39;  She motioned to the man in I had laid Geoff next to, looking away quickly as I realized he was looking up at the roof of the cave with his eyes rolled back in his head, mouth open and too exhausted to even moan.  &#39;If I can get them to sleep with another potion, it can at least speed the recovery.&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;Try your best.&#39;  I said quietly, just as Zan returned with what looked like freshly cut wood.  &#39;Thank you Zan.&#39;  I said as I accepted the neatly cut wood.  Zan just turned and went back to standing by the entrance. <BR> <BR>It took about an hour to finally get them to sleep.  Sarah had mixed up some thing from the supplies she had scavenged from the village as well as a few roots that she sent Zan and I after.  &#39;Wow, he even has a green thumb&#39; she had commented with a weak laugh as Zan returned with more of the roots than I did. <BR> <BR>It was a couple days before Geoff woke up.  The others were sleeping peacefully, the fever gone, but the body still exhausted.  Even after Sarah&#39;s insistence to lay back down and rest, Geoff&#39;s only reply was &#39;Back off girl!  I was shrugging off stuff like this before your mama noticed your papa peeping on her!&#39;  His tone was half angry, half indignant.  &#39;Miki!  What the hell are you doing here?  After you led them to us!&#39; <BR> <BR>I couldn&#39;t think of anything to say.  He had a point.  Once again, my problems caused another harm.  He took my silence the exact wrong way. <BR> <BR>&#39;They came looking for you!  Called you by name!  Burning our homes and murdering our people because of YOU!&#39;  He was in full swing now, drawing a knife from his belt.  Sarah looked to Zan, who stood absolutely still, watching me.  &#39;I should kill you for the evil you brought to our village!  Because of you almost everyone is dead!&#39; <BR> <BR>His downward thrust might as well have been sent by Dino-express.  Aimed for my heart, already boiling with my own anger, my left hand came up and out from under the slightly tattered red banner, catching the blade of the dagger inches from my chest. <BR> <BR>&#39;You are not the only one who has lost some thing to them.&#39;  My voice quiet as my left hand held the knife fast, and started to crush it.  The metal gauntlet and otherworldly strength making it frighteningly easy.  &#39;I&#39;ve got more than one score to settle with that man.&#39; <BR> <BR>Unknowing of his weapon&#39;s fate in my grip Geoff held his position as he yelled at me, &#39;Yeah?  You think your problem is greater than my entire village?&#39; <BR> <BR>With a sudden &#39;snap&#39; the blade of the knife broke free of its handle.  &#39;He betrayed and killed my father.  Almost killed Sarah and myself.  Caused the one I hold dear as my mother unspeakable grief, and forced me on a quest that got Durahan killed!&#39;  I shouted back at him, the blade snapping several more times as I closed my fist completely.  &#39;You aren&#39;t the only one with a bloody score to settle with him, so GET IN LINE OLD MAN!&#39; <BR> <BR>Sarah told me, later, that I had drawn Durahan&#39;s sword with my right arm, between the words &#39;old&#39; and &#39;man&#39;.  In my rage I hadn&#39;t even noticed. <BR> <BR>Geoff backed up a step as I held the sword between us, his anger gone like a puff of smoke.  &#39;Lad...  That&#39;s...&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;Yes <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> it!&#39;  Sarah tells me later this is the first time she remembers me ever swearing more than twice in the same week, how ever mildly.  &#39;This is His sword.  This is His arm.  All I have left of him.  Because of that man, I have been forced to travel to this middle of nowhere place, in the cold, sleet and rain.  I have lost what was left of my family to get a deep dark secret before he did.  Oh yeah, when I GET this deep dark secret, I find out it is the last hope of a doomed people, and is made for the one thing I hate most, OKAY?  DO YOU GET THE PICTURE?&#39; <BR> <BR>I was crying then, feeling once again completely burnt out.  Some how I put the sword back to its resting place on my left shoulder, and relaxed my left hand, with the bits of Geoff&#39;s knife tinkling to the cave floor. <BR> <BR>&#39;Boy.&#39;  Geoff started, getting, from what Sarah tells me, the meanest look Angel had given anyone, ever.  &#39;I...  What are you going to do now?&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;Find him.  Kill him.  Go home and forget it ever happened.&#39;  My reply was muffled as I talked to the floor. <BR> <BR>Geoff took a step toward me, and put his hand on my shoulder.  &#39;Would you mind if I helped you?&#39;  He looked to the sleeping forms of the three other survivors.  &#39;The nearest town is about two weeks from here.  Once they are safe we can follow those bastards from where they came from.&#39; <BR> <BR>And so, Geoff became part of our ragged band.  Sarah, the shrine maiden.  Angel and Zan, two halves of the same madness.  Geoff the last hunter of the northern village.  And me.  With the only people dear to me either involved in this mess, or dead. <BR> <BR>We take the fight to them now. <BR> <BR> <BR>--------------------- <BR> <BR> <BR>Well people.  Again, sorry about the delay.  I have been in far too much stress than my normal tolerance allows and just couldn&#39;t focus enough to write anything more than &#39;arg why me&#39; over and over again. <BR> <BR>BUT!  Thats done now.  the 8 month problem has been solved &#40;don&#39;t ask.&#41; And I have normal stress levels again. <BR> <BR>Go ahead, question or comment, or point fingers and growl at me.  :&#41;

 You know, this is pretty interesting thus far, but I like your battle scenes, and can&#39;t wait to see how you accomplish a dragon. I really do enjoy good fight sequences. :D <BR> <BR>Plot is pretty cool, too, along with minimal to no spelling errors, I looked forward to the next, as always.
