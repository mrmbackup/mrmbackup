 I have decided to start an epic. I&#39;ve so far written two poems, the one about ripper and the madillo limerick. I now feel it&#39;s time to try my luck with an epic. Please comment if you can. Constructiv criticism helps a lot. Hpoe you like it! <BR> <BR>The MDA   Chapter 1: Work At Last <BR> <BR>“DING” <BR> <BR>“Instant noodles again, Keemo?” <BR> <BR>The question ran throughout the entire office. Keemo took his Nissan noodle soup out of the microwave and began stirring. Then, with a loud slurp, he cleaned out the small bowl. <BR> <BR>“You think I’m bad with these noodles, what about you and your instant macaroni and cheese, Kala?” <BR> <BR>“You’re right, Keemo, we are pretty down these days. I mean, the MDA used to have waiting lists for jobs. Now we have no customers, no income, and crappy food.” <BR> <BR>The MDA, or Monster Detection Association, was known for solving the toughest mysteries in the harshest conditions. They were once the most prestigious establishment in all the land. Then the phone stopped ringing, the door stopped knocking, and the cash stopped rolling in. No one knew how or why the popularity had decreased, only that the MDA officials were basically out of a job. <BR> <BR>Keemo, the founder of the organization, once belonged to the strongest ranch in the entire land. When he retired, he decided that he could find action elsewhere. So, he started the MDA. Being a Raiden, he was always able to catch and beat down the fastest and strongest bad guys. He could even glide in from a rooftop, and land on a criminal. However, he could not fly, and that’s where Kala came in. <BR> <BR>Kala, the Allure, was great with sky surveillance. Her purple body and silent wing strokes had always eluded capture or even a person’s sight. Many criminals were already behind bars before they knew what hit them. She loved her job, and the thrill of the hunt. Now she was out of practice, and had begun to show signs of boredom, and sadness. <BR> <BR>“Keemo, we’d better find other jobs. We barely made the rent this month, what happens at the end of this month?” Kala sounded weak as she thought of leaving the MDA. <BR> <BR>“Well,” Keemo started, “We hope and pray for work. If we don’t get it, we move out, join the other retired monsters, and live out the rest of lives in peace.” <BR> <BR>“But I don’t want that!” Kala slammed her fists against the desk. Keemo jumped and lost a few feathers he was shedding. “I’ve always been happy with things fast pased, exciting, and dangerous. I can’t imagine just sitting around and waiting to die!” A tear slowly rolled down her cheek. <BR> <BR>“What choice do we have?” Keemo’s words rolled off his tongue and slapped Kala with realization. She simply looked down, took out a pack of mac and cheese, and put it in the microwave. “You know, I’m going to miss this place.” <BR> <BR>She looked up at the office that had been her home for the past few years. A desk with nicked wood, a couch with torn cushions, three mattresses in the left hand corner, and walls once a vibrant white now a dull beige. The once exuberant office now looked like a hobo’s home in an alley. <BR> <BR>“At least we still have the view,” Kala sighed as she got up and went to the window to the left. The view of the ocean meeting the Kalaragi jungle was spectacular, the sound of the ocean was spectacular, and the office was anything but spectacular. Kala sat back down as the swaying fan creaked over the dim light. “If only we had some work…” <BR> <BR>“BOOM” <BR> <BR>The door exploded into the office and both Kala and Keemo jumped; Keemo losing more feathers. The third member of the MDA, Jango, slipped into the office with the biggest grin anyone had ever seen. Jango, the Metal Jell, was perfect for infiltrating enemy headquarters. All he had to do was compress himself as small as he needed to get inside a cracked door. His liquid metal body also could be disguised as a wall if an enemy walked by. He was also used for eavesdropping. <BR> <BR>“WE HAVE WORK!!!!!!!” <BR> <BR>Both Keemo and Kala jumped to their feet. With work, they could pay the rent and stay in business. Also, they would once again feel the thrill of the hunt.  <BR> <BR>“So where is he, or she? Where’s the customer?” Keemo stared at Jango for a good five minutes before Jango spoke up. <BR> <BR>“I have it right here,” Jango said as he pulled out the package. It was a black box, with a a golden lock. Hanging from the box was a golden key. Jango opened the package to reveal a cell phone. Noticing the large antenna on the end of the cell phone. It had a walkie-talkie feature. A red light blinked and a muffled voice came through. <BR> <BR>“I presume you are the famed MDA of Ryuwn, solvers of crime and missing things and persons?” the voice came from the phone, “I have a job for you. Head to the Kalaragi jungle, and you will find a password on a large palm tree. That is the password you must use to reach me. Right know, I can’t hear you, and If you get the password I can also confirm your location. And remember, I can pay handsomely,” the voice stopped and the transmission ended. <BR> <BR>Dollar signs flashed in Jango’s and Kala’s eyes. Work, money, and the thrill of the hunt. They were almost at the door when… <BR> <BR>“I don’t like it.” <BR> <BR>Both Kala and Jango stopped in their tracks and turned to face Keemo. They were stricken with both surprise and anger. What was there not to like? <BR> <BR>“What’s your problem, Keemo? We need to take this job; maybe we’ll be popular again.” Jango sounded desperate. <BR> <BR>“It’s very strange,” Keemo began, “Why not meet us face to face? What does he have to hide? I don’t like it. It sounds like a set-up.”  <BR> <BR>“But Keemo,” Kala spoke up, “We need the money. Without this job, we’ll be on an island in the middle of nowhere with old, stinky monsters.” <BR> <BR>“On normal conditions, I would refuse this job. But under the current circumstances, we’re desperately in need of some cash. Alright, let’s move out!” Keemo lifted his wing forward and opened the door. <BR> <BR>On to the Kalaragi jungle, on to mystery, or maybe even on to treachery… <BR>  <BR>Hope you liked it! More is on the way! -Icelord13

 Interesting take on what some monsters might do after retirement. &#40;What DOES happen to them when they retire anyway?&#41; I&#39;m looking forward to reading the second chapter.
