 Prologue: Mankind&#39;s Plight... <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Squad 2, in position...How&#39;s it look out there Squad 3?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Squad 3 in position...area is secure. We&#39;re ready to move in.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;All right Squad leaders you know the plan, stick too it.&#34; <BR> <BR>Commander Darius Wyn spoke quickly into the comm-crystal on his wrist before ordering his squad to move in. It was hard, trying to keep his voice from betraying nervousness. This was his first command assignment and what an assignment it was...the destruction of one of the hated battle Henger factories. At his signal a group of twenty men rushed towards the ominous domed structure in the distance. It was raining hard again, pouring and thundering. Yet Darius paid no mind to the water that soaked his shoulder-length brown hair or the mud that occasionally splashed his dark eyes. The storm was what made this entire attack possible. Darius stumbled through the raging downpour; trying to ignore the sharp, stabbing pain in his right shoulder. His troops, equally tired pushed onward under the dimming light of the moon. They were all drenched, the rain battering down upon the earth with unrelenting fury. Like madmen the platoon ran, sloshing through a layer of mud three inches thick. Darius stumbled again, falling to his hands and knees before quickly clawing his way upright. For a moment it felt as if all the forces of nature conspired against him... <BR> <BR>They neared the fencing that protected the factory. There, a group of magic&#39;s were franticly trying to get the auto-guns back online. Darius shouted his command and the human warriors fell upon the monsters. Personally, he hated killing magic&#39;s, they just looked to human for his tastes. Regardless, they were monsters all the same and the humans fought with unbridled hatred. Darius slew the last, sending his long-sword through the monsters waist, severing him in two and kicked his lower body to the ground. The enemy dead, he turned to his second... <BR> <BR>&#34;How long before the defenses reactivate?&#34; Wyn asks... <BR> <BR>&#34;Until the storm stops interfering with the systems Sir. The Hengers should be temporarily off-line as well...&#34;His second in command reported. Meanwhile some of the other squad members were chopping up the bodies of the dead magic&#39;s... <BR> <BR>Darius nods once, a sudden flash of lightening revealing the scarred face of a man who&#39;d seen more then a few battles and hardships in his time. The death of his family, the destruction of his birthplace...and he knew who to blame..they all did. Wiping the mud from the small crystal mounted on his wrist he spoke into it again... <BR> <BR>&#34;We are passed the defenses and moving in. The rest of you fan out and keep the perimeter secure... We&#39;re not letting one monster out of here alive. Move out!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#34;Does anyone else think this is going alittle too easy?&#34; Natia remarked as she thrust her broadsword into the soft earth. She was leader of squad three, stationed outside the perimeter to make sure no enemy reinforcements got past. Reinforcements? Yeah, right...she knew this job was going to be boring from the start. Brushing aside a few wisps of fiery, red hair that peaked out from under her helm she glanced to the soldier beside her.. &#34;Well?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I think we better be thankful it IS going this well.&#34; He stated, peering into the thick forest area that surrounded the compound... <BR> <BR>&#34;What I mean is I&#39;d rather be inside killing those freaks then out her baby-sitting you boys.&#34; They both chuckled at that one... <BR> <BR>&#34;I hear ya, believe me...and blowin this factory will...hmm?&#34; The soldier takes a step toward the looming trees, squinting his hazel eyes.. &#34;I thought I saw something...there, in the...Aarrggghh!!!&#34; <BR> <BR>They had no time to react as a blazing fireball shot out from the shadows beneath the trees. It stuck the soldier and his body erupted into a spray of flesh chunks, blood and metal armor shards. One such shrapnel struck Natia in the side but she had no time to tend to it... &#34;We&#39;re under attack!!!&#34; <BR> <BR>By the time she&#39;d uttered the words it was too late. The dark forest became alit with flame as the deadly spheres shot forth. Striking down the humans and bombarding the landscape. Those that tried to attack were killed before even getting close enough to see their enemy. The sky now echoed with screams of torment along side the crashing of thunder. Men could be seen rolling in agony along the ground, their bodies caught on fire. They were outnumbered, surrounded...they had to fall back. The few survivors retreated toward the factory...amidst the blood stained earth and deep craters left by the fireball attack.... <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Darius and his squad had traveled into the depths of the Henger Factory, making their way towards the power core. It was a simple matter of rigging it to explode, the cores were very unstable. Still, getting there was no easy task...even with the defenses weakened. They were occasionally confronted with Magic&#39;s and Evil hares but thus far suffered only one death among them. It was this place the men had trouble dealing with...this terrible place... All about them metal and machinery...it was so cold, emotionless, alien. Deactivated Hengers were everywhere...the squad would be easy prey if they didn&#39;t work fast. Fortunately all was going according to plan...it was almost too- <BR> <BR>&#34;Commander!! Commander come in! We&#39;re under attack! Heavy enemy reinforcements from the forest! They&#39;ve broken the perimeter!!&#34; It was the voice of Natia... <BR> <BR>&#34;No! Hold them back till we&#39;re finished! Give us five minutes!&#34; Darius screamed into the crystal. Suddenly the entire factory was rocked by a massive explosion on the outer wall. <BR> <BR>&#34;You have no time! Oh God...they&#39;re everywhere!! Acckkk!!&#34; The sound of choking and blood gushing from a slit throat was the last Darius heard from her...then he heard another voice...something that was almost human...and yet was NOT human... <BR> <BR>&#34;Commander of the resistance...sssurrender yourssself and I promise a quick death for you and your men...&#34; The voice sounded female, but with a hiss behind it.  <BR> <BR>They were out of time...  <BR> <BR>&#34;Go to hell!!&#34; Darius ripped off the comm-crystal and ordered his men forward. They ran, almost recklessly now. One by one the squad descended a steel ladder into the depths, jumping off and falling the rest of the way once the halfway point was reached. Darius was the last to go down, staying to make sure nothing attacked from the rear until each of his men were safe. Safe being a loose term...none of them were really safe. In fact this mission had just gone from assault to a suicide run. Sliding down the latter himself Wyn glanced around, leading them through the gray corridors. It was then he noticed the red warning lights flare overhead. More bad news...the factory was being restored...and in short order the defenses would mow them down... <BR> <BR>Suddenly Darius stopped in his tracks. Not expecting the sudden halt his men collided into him, pushing him forward. He landed on his stomach, mere inches away from the sight which caused him to stop in the first place. There lay Natia, her body tattered and butchered, laying in a broken heap. Darius gasped and struggled quickly to his feet as the pool of blood beneath the corpse drew closer. She was mangled, even chewed upon and the gross sight turned more then a few stomachs...and then...they saw her killer... <BR> <BR>It was a hybrid...Darius had heard of their existence but until this very moment could not imagine such an abomination being real. It was clearly female, her body was generally humanoid and stood well over six feet tall. Her skin was a shade of green, like a Zuum&#39;s. Her face was also human...except for the green scales that covered her neck and trailed up the side of her head. Her eyes were deep crimson and instead of hair she had a head full of tendrils that fell loosely about her shoulders. Again Darius was reminded of a Zuum...or rather the spikes on it&#39;s head as each one ended with a sharp point. The hybrid possessed four clawed fingers on each hand and a long tail lashed behind her. She wore a skin tight black uniform with steel armor covering her torso, shoulders and legs. Around the hybrids neck hung that symbol...the open eye with the twin colored iris of black and red. <BR> <BR>&#34;Commander!&#34; His second in command Talus called from behind... &#34;We&#39;ll hold it off! You blow this place straight to hell!&#34; <BR> <BR>He nodded &#39;Yes&#39; and charged forward in that instant, driving to shove this freak aside and get to the core. They were all dead men now, but if the core could be blown they&#39;d at least take out a factory and a legion of monsters. It would be true victory for the resistance...albeit a tainted one. Darius did indeed push past the hybrid. It was like hitting a brick wall and her armor tore into the flesh of his shoulder...still he got past. He didn&#39;t look back, hearing the sounds of battle as his men fell upon the creature. 18 against one...they&#39;d win, he had no doubt.  <BR> <BR>Tearing down the corridor, following a line of thick cables along the ceiling he finally saw the core ahead. Massive, cylinder shaped, surging with raw power... He stopped at the small control panel, taking huge gasps for air even as he worked. It would only a few minutes...but the results literally spoke for themselves...  <BR> <BR>&#40;Warning...Core meltdown in 60 seconds. Evacuate. Core meltdown in 56 second and counting...&#41; <BR> <BR>This mission had been a disaster, but the factory would STILL be destroyed. There were times when he&#39;d stay up at night, wondering what chance mere men and woman had against the monsters... Finally...they would spit in the ugly faces of those beasts! Finally they would taste victory against the unbeatable enemy! Finally they would- <BR> <BR>His train of thought was swiftly derailed as Darius felt sharp, unforgiving talons around his throat... It was the hybrid, leaning close to him so that those vile scales brushed his skin. He froze, feeling the warm blood drip from her claws, smelling it on the freaks breath... <BR> <BR>&#40;Warning...Core meltdown in 40 seconds and counting.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;Why human...I do believe your trying to kill ussss.&#34; Her tongue flicked in his ear, her grip tightening... &#34;Stupid creature...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I swear...one day...we humans will take back wh- ack!&#34; Darius wyn struggled as her grip tightened to the point of strangulation... <BR> <BR>&#40;Warning...Core meltdown in 30 seconds and counting.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;You are worthy only of the slave class...silly thing.&#34; She continued to brutally choke as the countdown continued... <BR> <BR>&#34;Da..mn...freak...&#34;He managed to choke out...before a quick snap of his neck ended the life of commander Darius Wyn. His body instantly grew limp and lifeless, his mouth open and slack..a thin line of blood flowing down the side. A moment later his body was thrown down like thrash...sprawled at the feet of the hybrid.. <BR> <BR>&#40;Warning. Warning. Core meltdown in 15 seconds.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;Should have picked better lassst wordsss..now..&#34;The Hybrid let her skilled talons fall over the console... &#34;Hmm...WHY didn&#39;t I pay more attention to the instructors on the meltdown exercise...?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#40;Warning. Core meltdown in 10 seconds&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;I heard you...&#34;She hissed in frustration, trying to get the system back online.. &#34;Oh, come on!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#40;Warning. Warning. Core meltdown in 5 seconds...4..3...2...&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok..this better work!&#34; The hybrid spoke to herself in a last ditch effort to save the factory... <BR> <BR>&#40;Core meltdown aborted.&#41; <BR> <BR>Breathing a huge sigh of relief the Hybrid knelt down beside the fallen human commander, searching his pockets and clothing. She could never understand for the life of her why, ANYTHING, would try to resist them...it just wasn&#39;t possible. This pathetic attempt proved and drove home that simple fact once again. She found little of interest..and then pulled out a very old piece of paper, folded carefully between a small pocket journal. The paper began to crumble as she opened it... <BR> <BR>~Come this July &#42;unreadable&#42; to the &#42;also unreadable&#42; Coliseum and witness another clash of skill and might as your favorite &#42;Unreadable also&#42; battle it out in the S cup tournament!~ <BR> <BR>It was a flyer of some sort, the rest was faded beyond recognition...except for the very, very faint picture at the bottom. It showed a Suezo and a hare...fighting each other? Why would monsters fight each other...how bizarre, this couldn&#39;t be. There were also other oddities and strange words like &#39;IMA&#39; and &#39;commitee&#39; and &#39;Ranchers&#39; scattered about. Carefully folding the flyer again she planned to take it to a historian she knew. It might be important...or at least interesting. The hybrid even looked into the journal, scanning over the last page. It was all sentimental garbage..worthless humans. She tossed it aside, her tail slapping Darius&#39;s lifeless face as she departed.... <BR> <BR>Not long after she began the journy back home, ensuring the factory was up and running again before departing. Her legion of Zuum troops had a rather good meal that evening... Devouring the hapless humans beneath the cool nights sky...
