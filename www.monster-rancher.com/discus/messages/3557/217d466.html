&#39;Twas a night in September &#40;based on &#34;&#39;Twas the Night Before Christmas&#34; by Clement Clarke Moore&#41;. Verses by Lao.  <BR> <BR>&#39;Twas a night in September, when all through the ranch,  <BR> <BR>Not a monster was stirring, not a Mock or its branch.  <BR> <BR>The stars brightly shone in the sky and we dared  <BR> <BR>To camp out in hopes that an alien we&#39;d scare;  <BR> <BR>The monsters were sleeping all snug in their stable,  <BR> <BR>We&#39;d just finished eating, and Joy cleared the table;  <BR> <BR>Then Colt in her pup-tent, and I in my wrap,  <BR> <BR>Settled in for the stake-out, and tried not to nap.  <BR> <BR>When just as we thought things could not get more boring,  <BR> <BR>Master Pabs was awakened, by his own crazy snoring.  <BR> <BR>We all had a giggle, Pabs called Colt a fool,  <BR> <BR>But when he had stopped listening, she called him a tool.  <BR> <BR>When laughter had finally ceased to infect,  <BR> <BR>A whirring was heard, in the sky, to our left.  <BR> <BR>When suddenly, what to our eyes should appear?  <BR> <BR>But the alien ship, with its lights, blue and clear.  <BR> <BR>As it flew through the sky it did jiggle and jaggle,  <BR> <BR>And it so surprised Joy that her tail-feathers waggled.  <BR> <BR>As quick as our blinking it landed nearby,  <BR> <BR>It was big as our house, and now down from the sky!  <BR> <BR>Master Pabs ran around, screaming &#34;RIOT! INVASION!&#34;  <BR> <BR>But before long calmed down, after lots of persuasion.  <BR> <BR>Then stunned by a bright light that blinded us all,  <BR> <BR>We saw &#40;after dimming&#41; that the ship had grow small!  <BR> <BR>It grew arms, It grew legs, and bewildered expression,  <BR> <BR>And proceeded to ask of us obscure directions.  <BR> <BR>It was looking for cohorts it had long left behind,  <BR> <BR>And it made rude remarks &#39;bout the size of our minds.  <BR> <BR>Master Pabs was disturbed &#40;and became very blue&#41;,  <BR> <BR>Until glancing at Colt, he decided &#39;twas true.  <BR> <BR>We established a parley, and &#39;fore long were told,  <BR> <BR>That they had left disc chips, in ages thought old.  <BR> <BR>They were shocked that we hadn&#39;t heard tell of their folk,  <BR> <BR>They had left us a crystal, to unlock their yolks.  <BR> <BR>Then as oft was his habit, Old Pabs he orated;  <BR> <BR>We yawned and rolled eyes, as he ceaselessly prated.  <BR> <BR>He told us a story, now thought quite unlikely,  <BR> <BR>Of a metalloid people, who had dropped off a shrine-key.  <BR> <BR>It was blue, it was lighted, and its use was a quirk,  <BR> <BR>It was later abandoned, the darn thing didn&#39;t work!  <BR> <BR>It was thrown in a closet, and it long gathered dust,  <BR> <BR>&#39;Til amid an upheaval, by some chance it got bust.  <BR> <BR>The Metalner listened, and scoffed he anew,  <BR> <BR>And marveled and wondered at our backwardness too.  <BR> <BR>He chided our dullness, rebuked our sad station,  <BR> <BR>And declared our stupidity, in loud proclamation!  <BR> <BR>We were angry, it&#39;s true, at this self-proclaimed god,  <BR> <BR>But we figured it best to just smile and nod.  <BR> <BR>Forebearance went well with our alien friend,  <BR> <BR>And superior being, our crisis did end.  <BR> <BR>It reached in its body &#40;Pabs went for his pistol&#41;,  <BR> <BR>And pleasantly smiled, as it brought forth a crystal!  <BR> <BR>He gave it to Colt &#40;while Pabs put back his gun&#41;,  <BR> <BR>Then went on to explain that his people were fun.  <BR> <BR>Then obviously making a really lame joke,  <BR> <BR>He gave us the Idiot&#39;s Guide to his folk.  <BR> <BR>After taking his leave, and then blinding us twice,  <BR> <BR>He grew again bigger and was gone in a trice.  <BR> <BR>But we heard his loud voice as he winked out of sight,  <BR> <BR>Screaming, &#34;IDIOT HUMANS, THIS TIME GET IT RIGHT!!&#34;  <BR> <BR>Happy Holidays. ;&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- Lao &#40;darklao@hotmail.com&#41;, December 17, 1999  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Nice poem!

That was wonderful! I haven&#39;t laughed that hard in a long time. Everyone here at work now thinks I am insane, and reading them the poem hasn&#39;t helped, but it is still wonderful!
