 Here’s part 2 of my story. Hope you enjoy. <BR> <BR> <BR>First week of training. I didn’t think it would goes as well as before considering the fact that Jamaru was only a puppy when he first entered the tournament. Unfortunately, I was right. <BR> <BR>On the first day, Jamaru trained on over fifteen different courses. All fifteen of them failures. He was about to give up, but after a few talks here and there, he was back on all fours yet again. The second day went fairly well. Some courses went good, some went bad. But, as usual, Jamaru was prepared for anything. As for the rest of the week, everything seemed to run smoothly. Or at least that’s what Jamaru quoted. Until the fifth day of training, that is. <BR> <BR>“Whadda mean rest?! I still have training to do! Come on!” <BR> <BR>“You heard me, Jamaru. Rest. I’ll guarantee you that you’ll feel better the next day.” <BR> <BR>“But I feel good now! Why rest?!” He stopped abruptly when I waved a piece of his favorite food in front of his nose……cucumber. <BR> <BR>“You want this, right?” <BR> <BR>“Uhhhhhh……” At this point, his tongue was now out of his mouth. <BR> <BR>“Are you sure? It looks too delicious…even for you.” <BR> <BR>“Ahhhhhhh…..” drool now was dripping from his slobbery mouth. <BR> <BR>“You can have this….BUT…..” I said as I took the cucumber away from Jamaru, who was about to snatch it away. “You must REST. I’m concern that you’ll work yourself to death. Got it?” <BR> <BR>“Yah, yah. Sure, sure” His eyes were now hypnotized on the vegetable. I sighed and casually handed him the cucumber. In a flash, my hand was empty, and I turned my head, only to see Jamaru, happily eating in the meadow somewhere. I sighed and continued with the drawing I had worked on earlier this morning. And no, it wasn’t an angel. I was trying to draw a happy little robin perched upon a tree top, but unfortunately, it was only half of that. Literally. <BR> <BR>I looked up at the sky to see a majestic hawk flying beneath the clouds. Oh, how gallantly it looked soaring through the air like that. It made me feel what it would feel like to fly. I know everybody asks that, but it just occurs to me: Do they really want to take the chance to fly? I know I would love to if I was given the chance. A gentle breeze whisked my drawing into the air. This disturbed my concentration from the hawk, and quickly I got up to grab my paper. <BR> <BR>“Hey, get back here, you!” The wind still carried my drawing off, until it stopped and gently landed on the ground…..in front of someone’s foot. I suddenly stopped in my tracks. Wh….. who is this guy? Was he watching us this whole time? I thought silently to myself. The stranger picked up the paper and examined it hard. I started to get nervous.  <BR> <BR>“You drew this?” Was all he said after the long silence. What with my throat frozen as the stranger looked at my immature doodle, I could only nod. He tossed it casually upon my feet. He then turned his head over to Jamaru, who was licking his paws from scarfing that cucumber down. “And is that your monster over there?” Again, I could only nod. Suddenly, the stranger snapped his fingers. I kind of wondered why he snapped his fingers. Maybe for rhythm, I guess. But my questions were soon to be cut short. <BR> <BR>Beyond the meadow hills, I could hear galloping. And, to my surprise, was standing next to the stranger in just a matter of seconds. I can really say right now, I have never encountered a monster like this before. Its mule like legs standing firmly upon the ground, and a reptilian body, chest on up, mounted on top. Jamaru walked over slowly, gazing at the magnificent creature. <BR> <BR>“This is my Centaur, Charles. And who might that fellow be over yonder?” I followed the stranger’s eyes over to Jamaru, who still, was staring at Charles. <BR> <BR>“Oh, him? This is my Tiger, Jamaru.” I nervously said. I didn’t like how he introduced his Centaur. <BR> <BR>“Well, then. He looks quite the fighter. May I interest you two to a duel?” One of the Centaur’s legs kicked a little dirt behind him. Jamaru, away from his trance now, gave me his usual confused looked. I sighed and turned to the stranger. <BR> <BR>“We accept. As long as this isn’t a fight to the death.” Jamaru now got the idea. <BR> <BR>“A fight?! Oh, boy! About time we got some action!” Excited and pumped, Jamaru went into his battle position. <BR> <BR>“Sounds fair enough. Charles . . .” He said, politely enough. With a flick of his hand, Charles calmly walked over into the imaginary battle ring. Although I was excited to train Jamaru through battle, I was still a little worried. Both were in an intense eye stare down. Jamaru’s eyes transfixed on Charles, while Charles’s eyes were fixed . . . . on the pendant wrapped around Jamaru’s neck. <BR> <BR>This made me a little suspicious.  <BR> <BR>Well, here’s the second part. What a strange place to leave you guys hangin’ eh? Well, anyway, I’m always open to comments, improvement comments, and reviews, so yah^_^.
