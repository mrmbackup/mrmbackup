 100 years have passed since ranching had reached it&#39;s prime. Monsters have become thousands of times stronger than they were when ranching was new. Some monsters had went unbeaten in their fighting career. Some have won big tournaments at young ages. It was not uncommon for a young monster to appear and tear through the competition. Now people went into a hot debate, Who was the best of all-time? Some suggested monsters and others brought up points on how they were wrong. Then one day a man came up with an idea to have them fight in one last tournament.  <BR> <BR>Monsters that were famous and had become well known weren&#39;t allowed to live out their lives and die. They were frozen with advanced technology. They let the people vote on the top 8 monsters of all-time. They had finally came to the verdict. They had closed the polls and counted the votes and the top 8 were as the following...  <BR> <BR>Zeke, a Pure Zan who collected an impressive record of 358-0. He hadn&#39;t fought a match that went over 30 seconds. He was a 5 time world champion and was never challenged, he would take the 1 seed of the field of 8.  <BR> <BR>Elizkee, a Durahan/Dragon who had a record of 231-0. He was a 3 time world champion and was banned from fighting after his finals match in his 3rd world championship after decapatating an opponent. He is eligible for this battle and is the 2nd seed.  <BR> <BR>Ruth, a Pure Metalner who was a 7 time world champion and had a record of 20-0. She only competed in world championships so she never had to fight that many times. She has never fought longer than 13 seconds. She takes the 3rd seed.  <BR> <BR>Stellar, a Tiger/Hare who was a 1 time world champion and a 4 time runner-up in the world championships behind Zeke. He collected a record of 127-4, his only losses coming to Zeke. He also was a racing dog and holds many speed records. He is the 4th seed.  <BR> <BR>Bree, a Joker/Dragon who is a 1 time world champion and a 2 time world placer and held a record of 178-2, his only losses coming from Stellar at the semi-finals. He holds the record for fastes K.O. at :001. He is the 5 seed.  <BR> <BR>Mo Mo, a Pure Mocchi who is a 7 time world champion with a record of 231-9 he lost many battles to opponents from different regions of the world in international competition. He will be the 6 seed.  <BR> <BR>Vox, a Golem/Tiger who is a 4 time world runner-up behind Mo Mo with a record of 302-4. He is the heaviest monster ever noted. He will be the 7 seed.  <BR> <BR>Fleck, a Hopper/Pixie who is a 8 time world champion with a record of 55-0. He fought during an uncompetitative time and had no real challenge which shows his low seeding, he is the 8th and final seed in this tournament.  <BR> <BR>Round 1 will be the following..  <BR>Zeke vs. Fleck   <BR>Elizkee vs. Vox  <BR>Ruth vs. Mo Mo  <BR>Stellar vs. Bree  <BR> <BR>&#34;Loser of round 1 will be put in a consolation bracket everyone will be placed.&#34; Announced someone over the loud speaker.  <BR> <BR>Comments, suggestions? I&#39;m trying out something new and this is what came to mind, I will finish up round 1 tonight.

 I like the idea. However, your concepts were a little vague. What&#39;s the setting? Is it winter, fall, summer, spring? You showed no indication of a time and place. Only that its 100 years past the monster prime. For the next chap, just remember to give us an outside climate, a time, and descriptions.

 Crowds of people from all over the world had packed into an arena that could hold 2 million people. The view was horrible for those in the back row so many just watched the big screen projecting the action onto a huge screen that was 50X50. People who spoke many different languages had also arrived and the announcer translated what he said into many different languages. It was time and all the monsters had been unfrozen, broght to life to fight for what they had used to, pride, honor and shear enjoyment.  <BR> <BR>Round 1 had begun a dong had been rung and the monsters had walked out and caught sight of the sunlight that they haven&#39;t seen in years. they had been told what they were there to do and they prepared. Zeke and Fleck had gotten a meal and rested up and when time came they had walked out. An announcer announced them and their accomplishments throughout their career.  <BR> <BR>Zeke stood tall and his shadow cast above that of the much shorter hopper. Zeke&#39;s red eyes glared evily at Fleck. Fleck was calm and showed no fear towards Zeke, Zeke&#39;s vains buldged and his muscles tensed.  <BR> <BR>&#34;BEGIN!!&#34; The universal exclamation of the announcer started the match.  <BR> <BR>Zeke soared high in the sky, he started the match by jumping up as high as he could. He was looking down at the hopper who stood on the ground looking upwards concentrated at the sky. Zeke seemed to float up in the air, he spread out his arms and breathed a sigh of relief. He then looked down at the ground and with the speed of light dashed downwards towards Fleck. Zeke hit the ground gracefully, holding up his body with one of his claws outstrecthed from his body. He was upside down. Fleck had jumped out of the way. Fleck reached out his hand and a blast of fire came ferciously out. Zeke jumped of his claw and over the blast of fire which seemed as a distraction as Fleck smashed him with one of his limp body parts that he flung out. Spit flew from Zeke&#39;s mouth as he grabbed ahold of Fleck&#39;s arm pulling him towards himself. Zeke stabbed at Fleck but, with great control of his body, Fleck flew upwards with his short wing flapping furiously. He let on more blast of fire down on Zeke.  <BR> <BR>As the smoke cleared Zeke was gone. Had he been burnt to death, to ashes? There was no proof of his demise, nothing. Then above Fleck appeared a flash, it was Zeke. He landed a quick elbow down on Fleck&#39;s head. Fleck slammed down onto the cold hard ground. his face bounced off the floor and he skidded a few feet and didn&#39;t move. It seemed like he was out cold but, he bounced to his feet. His nose drew little blood. Zeke, against the nature of his breed drew a smile. He grinned at the thought of having a competative enemy.  <BR> <BR>Fleck hopped back a few feet and reared back both his fists. With all his fury his let out thousands of lashes with his strecthy arms one by one smacking Zeke in the face, body and whatever he could make contact with. zeke was being pummeled but, wasn&#39;t showing any emotion, definatly not pain, atleast. Fleck begun sweating as his attack didn&#39;t do a thing. He tensed his muscle in his right arm and strecthed his out furiously at Zeke. This blow was backed up with alot more power and speed than the first assualt.  <BR> <BR>BOOM!  <BR> <BR>Boom. That was the only sound heard after contact. Zeke hasn&#39;t been challenged in his career. He was just now smashed with a blow with power beyond any thought. Zeke skidded back and was smashed into the side of the arena. Thousands of pounds of debris and rocks from the stadium flew ontop of him. The crowd was silent. Fleck wiped off his forehead and then got back in his stance. The referee went up to raise his hand the winner but, Fleck knocked his hand away, fixed on the spot the Zan was blown into.  <BR> <BR>Fleck then looked down in horror as he could feel something under him. The referee ran off the stage and Zeke shot up from under the ground. Fleck jump out of the way and he threw two flicks at zeke. Knocking him off balance. the he pointed his finger and shot a Lightning bolt at Zeke. A horrible scream jolted out of Zeke&#39;s mouth as he fell to the ground having convulsions. Drool seeped out of Zeke&#39;s mouth as he laid motionless on the ground. Fleck flew into the air and came dashing from the air and slammed into Zeke. smashing him through the ground. Fleck got up from the hole he had smashed his opponent in and let out a flame. Zeke blocked the flames with his claws and hopped out of the hole. He dusted off his body and sped right by Fleck. Then seconds later Fleck flew backwards and hit the ground. he laid there for a second and Zeke lashed with his claws fleck rolled over and Zeke slashed his claws through the ground. Fleck jumped up and was kicked hard in his stomach and he hit the side of the arena. Zeke ran up to finish the match. Fleck flew out his arm and grabbed Zeke&#39;s neck and threw him into the crowd. Zeke hit at about the middle and he shot out from the crowd and Fleck got in his stance and flew towards Zeke. the slammed together and went fist for fist and claw for claw.  <BR> <BR>When the clash was over they both stood hunched over and got back into their stances. They were too tired for fancy moves the both got in close and brutally went swing for swing at each other. They slashed, clawed, spat, bit each other for half an hour. They both gave up no ground. Neither wanted to lose, that meant no championship, no honor and they were soon to be frozen. Zeke grabbed Fleck&#39;s head and began to slam it against his own. The savage ways of Zeke was slowly paying off as Fleck became weaker. fleck went for one uppercut, which proved effective and it knocked Zeke off his feet. Zeke tripped Fleck from his weak stance. Fleck stood up and tensed his muscles once more getting ready for one more blow, he reached back and smashed the Zan. Dust flew up and Fleck had fall unconcious. The pit that had Zeke in it was promptly checked after Fleck was found unconcious and zeke slowly crawled out of it and the referee raised his arm the victor.  <BR> <BR>Zeke had then collasped and had to be carried off the stage. The announcer then commented on how these monsters were willing to give it all to win and would never ever give up, even if it meant dying.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll get to the Elizkee Vox match soon. This one kinda drained me..

 A few things bugged me with this part. First, you need to proofread your work. I saw many runons and some sentences just didn&#39;t make sense. <BR> <BR>The thing that really bugged me. <BR> <BR>&#34;The view was horrible for those in the back row so many just watched the big screen projecting the action onto a huge screen that was 50X50.&#34; <BR> <BR>I think you meant to say, <BR>&#34;The view was horrible for those in the back row. Many just watched the large, 50X50 screen projecting the action.&#34; <BR> <BR>Good story with good battles. It just needs a little cleanup on the sentences. Very Nice.
