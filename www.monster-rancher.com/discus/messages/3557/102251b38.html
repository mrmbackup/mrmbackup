 It has been 5 years of pain-staking training,a boy with a Zuum had become a man.They fought hard though out that time and had been undeafed.They had won the Major 4 in both the IMA and FIMBA regions.  <BR> <BR>     The boy was unstoppable he had no one that could stand up to him,and all that tried fell quickly.He had become cocky of his abilities and powers.He wanted more than just a measly trainer who had beaten the Major 4 once with troubles.He wanted a master.  <BR> <BR>     Tesca,was that master he wanted.He was near death and hadn&#39;t been beaten either.One faithful day the young man ran into Tesca.  <BR>&#34;I&#39;m sorry sir,please excuse me..I&#39;m in a hurry to find a man by the name of,Tesca.&#34;the boy said softly  <BR>&#34;Oh ho ho,it seems you&#39;ve found me.&#34;Tesca grinned.The boy looked up at him and smirked back at him.  <BR>&#34;I&#39;m glad I ran into you,so now I can actually have a decent opponent now.&#34;The boy said eagerly  <BR>&#34;Hmmm,so your that lad that has been going through beating the Major 4 in both regions,eh?So that means your,Johnny.Pleased to meet you.&#34; Tesca smiled  <BR>&#34;Same here&#34;Johnny said shaking Tesca&#39;s hand.  <BR>&#34;So you want a fight.Good,i&#39;ll tell all the people and we&#39;ll hold it in a week.&#34;Tesca said and walked away.  <BR> <BR>      The news spread quickly the two greatest fighters of this time are going at it.The tickets were all most impossible to find a day later and people would do crazy things to get them,like go without eating til&#39; the match or wrestling a lion. <BR> <BR>      Regardsless the fight had started a week later.People crammed into the stadium and people tried to buy tickets off of other people and people tried to sneak in.The officers were having a busy day keeping out people who sneaked into the stadium and trying to figure out if the tickets were real or not.Ticket prices at the box were 100,000 G,so only people who were...rich could get in...It was time for the match to start anyways and people who didn&#39;t get to see it in person watched it up at the big screen or turned their radios to the station.Some people who could afford their own t.v watched it there.  <BR> <BR>      It was countdown for the fight....The judge had matched the monsters,both were maxxed out in everything and weighted the same.It was time.Tesca and his Dino,Rex walked out to the stadium the same time Johnny and his Zuum,Velo &#40;It was fitting =P&#41; did.The crowds blaired as the stood at the ends of the area.The stared at each other waiting for the match to be started.The Zuum rocked back and forth steadily as the Dino bounced slowly.The countdown to the start of the match was down to a minute the crowds were louder than ever,then it got down to 1 second and it converted to 0 graffti and cheers erupted through out the stadium as each fighter knew it was time to fight.  <BR> <BR>&#40;It&#39;s late over here so i&#39;m going to go to bed and finsh this in the morning,this was an intro basically.:&#41;&#41;

 Time seemed to slow down for Johnny as he stood,he had &#34;butterflies&#34; in his stomach he felt anxious to win and fight.He couldn&#39;t wait...The rules were,unlimited time and fight to the ko.  <BR> <BR>       Tesca grinned as his Dino seemed to steam up,then sparks flew around it.It slowly burned,Velo stood confused at what was happening same as his trainer Johnny.Eventually the Dino caught on fire.Johnny yelled to his Zuum,&#34;Get outta the way!!!&#34;It was no use,the Dino had taken off towards him,all the fans could see what a red streak blaze across the area in a heartbeat the Dino had a hold of the Zuum wrapping his arms around him to the best he could he slammed him into the ground with amazing force,the ground exploded and rubbled flew everywhere.The camera&#39;s focused on what had happened.People who knew that attack had already gooten up ready to leave,but they didn&#39;t wait for the dust to settle...  <BR> <BR>   When it did settle,the Dino&#39;s stomach was balanced on top of the Zuum&#39;s feet.Velo pushed Rex off of him and it the air Rex didn&#39;t come down hard,he landed softly on his feet and waited for Velo to attack.  <BR> <BR>    Johnny yelled for Velo to attack.So the Zuum did loyaly.He brought his head back and then shot it forwards shooting out 5 fire balls at Rex,but they were batted away by his tail back at the Zuum,the Zuum jumped over them in time.But not to see Rex launched his Flame attack.  <BR> <BR>    Fire spread around Velo his skin was burning,but he could stand the pain,the flame didn&#39;t last long and wasn&#39;t too effective.Velo countered it with a quick fireball Rex knocked it away with his head,but the Zuum followed it there.Velo opened his mouth and bit the Dino&#39;s neck,he held onto it as blood seeped out of the neck of the Dino.Rex&#39;s eye&#39;s widened as Velo bit deeper into his skin.Tesca stood without a clue what to do,for the first time.Blood started to hit the floor slowly,Johnny wanted Velo to hold onto the bite as long as possible.  <BR> <BR>    All Rex could do was wiggle and even that didn&#39;t help.Tesca smiled as he looked at the Zuum whose mouth was locked into his Dino&#39;s neck and yelled,&#34;Do the  Throw attack,Rex!!&#34;Velo&#39;s neck was long enough for him to bite it and he got a hold of it and squeezed tightly and flung him hard into the side of the arena.The zuum&#39;s body slithered down from the broken concrete he had been forced into and laid down.The judge began the count as he laid without moving,&#34;10...9...8...7...6...5....&#34;The judge had stopped after he had gotten to his feet,the Zuum had one reaction to what had happened,he vomited blood.Both of the lizards had enough power to continue to fight and the fans were cheering loudly for their side.The zuum returned to his spot,so did the Dino.  <BR>&#34;It&#39;s been forever since i&#39;ve had a fight like this.&#34;Tesca grinned,&#34;I&#39;ll die happy,knowing that this generation will be even better!&#34;Tesca said.  <BR>&#34;Lets end this with a bang&#34;Johnny yelled to Tesca,he smiled and said,&#34;Ready?!?&#34;.Johnny grinned.   <BR> <BR>    The Zuum had shot a huge ball of fire and so did the Dino,both of the fireballs crashed into another,they stayed at a stalemate as the Dino shot a flame and the Zuum shot a fireball,both to help out their bomb.The both exploded causing fire to spread,the stadium was being evactuated both of the trainers stood with confedince that they wouldn&#39;t be burned or beaten.The flame vanish and both of the lizards laid helplessly on the ground.Tesca and Johnny watched hoping that their Zuum would get up,both were out by ko,but the first to get up would win.  <BR> <BR>    The watched with unblinking eyes no one said anything,they just watched..The zuum being to move,he pressed his hands against the ground and stumble up to his feet.He stood up and looked at his fallen enemey and smiled and fell back down,Johnny was the winner!  <BR> <BR>     A month later,Tesca laid on his deathbed smiling as people surrounded him.He was near death and still hasn&#39;t seen Johnny.He was busy trying to get Holly to cheer up,but that was hard seeing as he was the one to die.Suddenly Johnny walked in the room.  <BR>&#34;Ahh,Johnny,my only rival to put up a fight against me....and even win.&#34;Tesca smiled  <BR>&#34;Yeah,that has a heck of a fight,i&#39;m glad I fought you when I did.&#34;Johnny said.  <BR>&#34;I&#39;m happy I fought someone like you before I die&#34;Tesca grinned.  <BR>&#34;Yeah,I don&#39;t know what to say...&#34; Johnny replied  <BR>&#34;Thank you,lad.That what I wanted to say.Thank you for giving me the best and final fight of my life.&#34;Tesca said softly,and died.Johnny stood up and walked away smiling with his zuum.
