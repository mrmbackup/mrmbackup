<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>Black Razor</B> on <B>Saturday, July 22, 2000 - 07:48 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 Chapter 17:Fading Hope... <BR> <BR>Ok, it&#39;s offical...I&#39;m back in the game. I&#39;m going to finish this fanfic no matter what, heck I&#39;ve worked on it long enough. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m getting to old for this.....&#34; <BR> <BR>The thought was passing through the Justice&#39;s mind more frequently then ever. Even as he and his comrades fought for there lives in the bowels of Moo&#39;s floating fortress, he wondered just how long his battle scared body would hold out...Ever since his &#39;retirement&#39; the durahan had been thrust into one battle after another, fighting against Moo&#39;s legions, the underground army of the insane Edgegar...and of course the hideous abominations of the Master..... <BR> <BR>The twisted, dark corridors of the floating fortress were hardly empty, nor silent. Everywhere the signs of a brutal and bloody conflict were evident. On occasion the group would run into one such battle and intervene on behalf of Moo&#39;s forces. Then there were the sounds, the noise of explosions and distant bloodshed. The horrible wail of monsters as they were torn to shreds, the cracking of bone, the splattering of blood....Justice found himself deeply disturbed by this. It surprised him, he was after all, a combat hardened warrior....but this slaughter was like nothing he&#39;d experienced in the tournaments. <BR> <BR>Time passed, the mad race for the engine room continuing. Leading the trio was the Gray Wolf, who was utterly determined to arrive first and stop the masters plot in the name of Moo. Justice followed with all the speed his metal body allowed, Celine flying right beside him, the huge Ganthor lumbering behind, taking up the rear. <BR> <BR>Suddenly the darkened corridor exploded, the western wall erupting into flame. Justice instinctively brought his shield to bear, protecting himself from harm. The others were not so fortunate as the force of the explosion hurled Celine violently to the wall, her head bouncing painfully off the obsidian stone before falling to the floor. Ganthor staggered back, nearly falling over and crushing the unconscious dryad. Gray Wolf escaped the blast entirely, barring his fangs as minions poured from the gaping hole. <BR> <BR>Justice charged forward, his blade cleaving the enemy with the precision and grace of one so experienced. Gray Wolf joined the fray, brutally mauling the horrible creatures while Ganthor regained his balance and countered. The entire battle lasted a only few, blood soaked moments. As the last minion fell dead Justice dropped his sword, staggering to his knees. His body felt weak suddenly, as though he&#39;d never be able to lift his blade again...The sensation lasted but a few seconds before the durahan stood erect. Celine pulled herself up, her head bleeding... <BR> <BR>&#34;Leave her!&#34;Gray Wolf snarled.&#34;She will only slow us down. There is not time!&#34; With those words he bolted down the hall, seeming not to care weather they followed or not. Justice turned to Celine, knowing she can&#39;t fight injured. On the other hand they couldn&#39;t leave her behind to get picked off by the Masters roving legions... <BR> <BR>Celine cringed from the pain, blood dripping down her left cheek...She frowns, muttering weakly,&#34;I seem to always wind up a burden to you...You better leave me behind, if the fortress falls...&#34; <BR> <BR>The durahan wasted no time to arguing with Celine, lifting dryad up and carrying her dispite her protests. They continued after Gray Wolf who had stepped in some blood, leaving an easy trail to follow. Justice was beginning to wonder if they could get there in time, would it be too late? A group of black dino&#39;s appeared, beating back a few minions as Justice pondered. They ignored the fact that the trio bore not the crest of Moo, concerned only with the freakish beasts that assaulted at every turn. <BR> <BR>&#34;I hate to say this,&#34;Ganthor yelled as he lumbered behind Justice. &#34;But man am I glad to see Moo&#39;s guys winning a few of these fights. Maybe the Masters not doin so good after a- <BR> <BR>His voice cut short as the came across a horrific sight...dozens of monsters lay dead in the halls before them, all servants of Moo, blood and innards splattered along the walls. There wounds were strange, each one punctured with dozens of holes. Ganthor slowly reached down, struggling to pick up a tiny metal object with his massive fingers. He finally succeeds, holding it before justice. The durahan looked at it, about to comment when he heard a familiar voice....a voice he despised..... <BR> <BR>They turned a sharp corner, finding at last the passage leading to the engine room, but they found much more...On the opposite side of the corridor stood none other then Vor, the Lorica, accomplice to Cid&#39;s murder and Justice&#39;s eternal nemesis. Surrounding him were twenty battle Hengers, their arms replaced with high-tech machine guns. It was these weapons that had devastated Moo&#39;s ranks down the hall, leaving so much death in their wake. Gray Wolf lay before them, a long slash wound down his side. Vor&#39;s deadly saber dripping with the tigers crimson life-force. <BR> <BR>&#34;Vor....&#34;The durahan&#39;s voice dripped with hatred, he quickly placed Celine in ganthor&#39;s protective grasp before drawing his sword. &#34;I won&#39;t let you succeed Vor...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Justice!?&#34;Vor gasped, amusement in his voice.&#34;Well, you pop up in the darnest places...first the dryad forest, now in the bowels of Moo&#39;s fortress....do you want to die so badly old man?&#34; The lorica&#39;s grip tightens around the hilt of is red blade... &#34;Then again, why waste my energy when I can have you all mowed down...Battle Hengers, open fire!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Ganthor! Let me go!&#34;Celine slipped out of the stronghorn&#39;s hands and flew forward....&#34;Flame Wall!!&#34; A surge of flame erupted from the floor, filling the entire hall just as the hengers took aim. They opened fire, pouring out thousands of bullets...the flame wall held against them, incinerating them as they past. Occasionally a few did get through, forcing Justice and Ganthor to take cover. Black smoke began to slowly fill the corridor... <BR> <BR>&#34;Cease fire!&#34;Vor screamed, waving his blade angrily as he stared into the rising cloud. He could only sumise that a fire had been started elsewhere and that smoke was being channeled through a duct. If it was in fact the engine burning, then his mission was already complete. &#34;Hengers, forward march, destroy all hostiles!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Roger, Roger!&#34;The lead Henger spouted before a huge sphere of energy flew from the smoke, the result of a pixies big-Bang attack. It exploded violently, forcing Vor to stagger slightly and destroying half of his minions. Suddenly Ganthor and justice charged forth, desismating the remaining battle hengers. In the confusion Vor slipped down the hall towards the engine room... <BR> <BR>Justice turns, his grip tightening around his blade as Vor escapes... &#34;Ganthor, Celine...let me handle this,&#34; He looks down at the injured Gray Wolf. The general of moo glares up at Justice. <BR> <BR>&#34;What are you doing??&#34;He growls.&#34;All is lost if the powersouce is destroyed. Stop him!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Becareful Justice,&#34;Celine said, breathing heavily from her expenditure of power. Ganthor echoed her remark...Wasting no more time, Justice ran after Vor, it was time to claim his revenge...He ran, chasing his nemises into the deepest bowels of the Fortress, the Lorica always one step ahead. He&#39;d been given a sizable head start, fortunately lorica&#39;s moved quite slowly and Vor was no exception despite his massive strength. <BR> <BR>At last Justice found him standing in a massive chamber, before them stood Moo&#39;s powersource...A huge ebony spire rose before them, made of black crystal. The sheer power that radiated from it caused Justice to stagger back in alarm, indeed this was kept the Fortress afloat. At the spires base electrical cords and machines with flashing buttons were connected. The durahan of course had no idea how the thing worked, and was given no further time to ponder the fact as Vor rushed forward with sword drawn. <BR> <BR>At that moment Justice cared not for preserving Moo&#39;s fortress, the only thing he saw was his enemy, the only thing he felt was hatred and the only thought running through his mind was &#39;Vengeance&#39;. <BR> <BR>&#34;Vor!&#34;Justice screamed, charging forward with shield extended, the lorica turning to face him. Vor stood his ground, after all, what harm could an old durahan possibly do? Obviously more then he though...Justice rammed him, the sheer power of the blow sending both warriors straight through the armored hull of the fortress. They plummeted downward, into the middle of the airal war being waged in the skies... <BR> <BR>Suddenly Justice struck something hard, he had landed atop one of Moo&#39;s black dragons. He looked up to see that Vor had also managed to save himself, grabbing the tail of an overlord. The ebon dragon had no time to protest the fact he was now being ridden as a huge swarm of minions flew towards them with hostile intent. As the dragon swired to avoid certain death Justice scanned the skies for signs of Vor. He saw nothing of his enemy, the skies thick with the thousands upon thousands locked in brutal conflict. <BR> <BR>The armored dragon upon which he now rode had managed to survive the initial onslaught, rejoining a squadron heading for the raven itself. Justice realized they must be on a bombing run, though he doubted if they could do any real damage. Of course, what mattered now was getting off and back to the fortress. Alas, the dragon ignored his requests, taking him farther and farther from the floating monstrosity and straight into the Raven&#39;s mouth... <BR> <BR>Rejoining the squadron the ebon dragons began the assault while justice could only hold on tightly. His only hope would be that the monster on which he rode returned safely, of course that was highly unlikely...The run began smoothly enough, the huge dragons glided effortlessly through the sky and unleashed their fiery payloads upon the raven. It looked too easy, the skies before the ship had cleared, most of the fighting being down around the floating fortress, only the flagship itself presented a threat...and a great threat it was...The burning attacks produced by the dragons had no effect, leaving not a scratch on the enemies armor. The squadron continued, attacking as they flew over the ships smooth surface. Suddenly hidden gun-ports revealed themselves in the seamless hull, firing devastating blasts of energy. At the same moment dozens of minions appeared at the squadrons flank, justice was shocked to find the lead unit was being led by Vor....The carnage that followed happened so quickly...the blast shredding the dragons while bloodthirsty minions impaled the few survivors. Justice battled atop his ride, defending the dragon from the hordes, allowing it to focus on avoiding death. It seemed that they&#39;d both escape, when Vor appeared atop his overlord, raising his gauntlet to the masters symbol..... <BR> <BR>&#34;Master....lend me you power!&#34;Vor cried to the heavens.&#34;Power Unlimited!&#34; The Lorica&#39;s body began to glow with a crimson light, he thrust his palm forward, sending a beam of power towards his target. The black dragon tried to avoid the blast but was struck, plummeting to the ground with a bloody hole in it&#39;s chest. Justice had one chance to escape, a hideous living transport floating towards Moo&#39;s fortress to deliver another load of troops. The durahan leaped from the dragon, feeling regret he&#39;s never even learned the creatures name. He landed upon the bloated backside of the transport, it&#39;s pale flesh oozing and pulsating underfoot. Vor leaped from his ride as well, landing nimbly, surrounded by a frightening crimson aura. Justice could feel the power radiating off him, the power greater then ever. Vor pointed his saber at justice, calling him on... <BR> <BR>&#34;My power is increased Ten fold now!&#34;Vor laughed,&#34;You could not defeat me on your own level...now you will face my true power!!! Any last words old man?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You talk too much...&#34;Justice spat, shifting into his fighting stance. &#34;Besides, the life that ends here will not be my own.&#34; <BR> <BR>They rushed each other, their swords locking in an epic struggle. Vor proved his boast correct however, his power was unheard of. With one blow he struck the shield from justice&#39;s hand, sending the durahan back. The lorica approached at it&#39;s leisure, each strike shaking Justice to his core as he struggled to parry each attack. Vor&#39;s strength was simply overwhelming and he soon found himself caught in the defensive position, each swipe of the crimson saber chipping at his constitution. Trying to take the offensive was useless as the lorica&#39;s speed had increased as well. All the while they flew closer and closer to the fortress... <BR> <BR>Struck with another devastating blow, justice was thrown onto his back, the ebony spires of the fortress now very close. Vor picked him up and delivered blow upon blow, torturing his opponent before deciding to kill him. Justice had had enough, his anger and rage boiling up from deep within. He saw the image of his dead trainer flash in his mind...As Vor raised his hand for the death blow the durahan saw his chance, thrusting his blade into the transport...the monster screamed, the sudden trembling caused Vor to lose his balance. Justice grabbed his nemesis from behind, hurling him toward the fortress, Vor slammed into a spire and slid down a bit before coming to a halt. Justice leaped after him as the transport fell... <BR> <BR>Vor held onto a spike to keep from falling off Moo&#39;s roof, aiming his free hand at justice, a crimson blast issuing forth. The beam sliced through the top-most spire as though it was butter, Justice took cover just in time to avoid the blast. Vor slipped suddenly, grasping the spike with both hands, narrowingly avoid a fall. It was only then that justice realized his enemies predicament, Vor was hanging on by a thread. Had it come down to this? Could he have been so lucky? All that was needed now was to knock the murderer to his doom, then it would be liqua&#39;s turn....Suddenly a quick, stabbing pain brought justice to his knees, an intense ringing in his head. It was as though his body shut down, tired from the constant damage it was forced to endure and was rebelling against him. For a moment the pain clouded his mind, but then came the thought that perhaps he could do no more...His battle scared body screamed for an end to this quest for vengeance. As all this poured through his metal skull he didn&#39;t notice Vor pull himself up, now he approached the helpless warrior with saber poised to strike. <BR> <BR>&#34;You had your chance old man...now prepar-&#34;Vor never got a chance to finish as a huge shape erupted from beneath him. It was Ganthor and the stronghorn wasted no time in slamming his fist into Vor. The lorica went flying backward, tumbling down the side of the floating fortress, hitting many a spike on the way down. He was saved at the last moment by the massive jaggernaut, Darklon. Justice took a quick glance into the skies above. To his amazement he saw the tides of battle turning, the masters minions were in retreat.  <BR> <BR>&#34;You ok?&#34;Ganthor asked as he picked justice up with one hand and brought him inside. The warrior nodded &#39;Yes&#39; even though he was still in great pain. They now stood in Moo&#39;s command center which looked as if a great battle had been waged not long ago. Moo himself stared at the Dark Raven in silence. Suddenly energy began to surge at the ravens head, it was preparing for yet another blast, this one far greater then the last....Moo pointed a talon toward the ship and spoke... <BR> <BR>&#34;We cannot withstand another blast,&#34;He said with frightening calm.&#34;When that one hits...it&#39;s over.&#34; <BR> <BR>Justice shook his head in disbelief, after all that the master was still going to win??? They had fought with everything they had, but they simply could not stand against the ancient weapon, built for the sole purpose of destroying Moo and anything else that stood against it...Now, staring at the light of their own deaths justice wondered if they ever had any hope at all. For now all hope was lost..... <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, deep within the ravens belly three monsters where also rapidly loosing all hope as well. Stone Claw, Shielka and Beatdown had been put through utter hell, fighting against the ships internal defense systems. It was a suicide mission from the start, they couldn&#39;t escape so destroying the raven was the next best thing, even though it meant their own deaths. It would be worth of course, killing the master in exchange for a mere three lives...But none of the trio though of themselves as martyrs. Claw and Shielka fought for revenge and poor beatdown didn&#39;t want to do this at all. But it was too late to turn back now....now as they stood before the doors leading into the main power chamber. They&#39;d faced battle hengers, wall turrets and all manner of deviltry to get to this point, now all that was left to do was finish... <BR> <BR>&#34;How well is it defended?&#34;Claw asked, his chest sore and bleeding, the stone armor chipped away by bullets. Shielka and the fairy hair were pretty battered as well and all three exhausted. The daina took a moment to catch her breath, looking back periodically to ensure they were not followed. <BR> <BR>&#34;The power cell itself is defenseless...&#34;She said.&#34;The master never counted on anyone getting this far alive.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, well we prove em wrong.&#34;Beatdown said in an unusally quiet voice, she was too tired to even jump around and shadow box.&#34;We...showed them.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Then lets get this over with....&#34;Claw said as his talons pierced the door and tore it open. &#34;This should be ea-.......easy.&#34; <BR> <BR>The trident fell silent as thirty battle Hengers aimed their dual machine-guns. They had the power cell surrounded, leading them was the huge pressure, Flood. The masters warrior looked at them with silent hatred, his gaze falling on each in turn and then going back to shielka. <BR> <BR>&#34;You...will not touch the core.&#34;Flood said darkly, before looking to his troops.&#34;Kill..them.&#34; <BR> <BR>Stone claw narrowed his eyes, it looked like the end of the line...but he wasn&#39;t giving up just yet. &#34;Ladies...get ready.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Lets give up...it&#39;s over claw.&#34;Shielka said solomly.&#34;We....just can&#39;t win.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Listen to me......when I give the signal take out that core. Do you understand me?&#34;Claws demanded, making it clear he was giving an order and not a request. <BR> <BR>&#34;But, what about...&#34;Beatdown said doubtfully. <BR> <BR>&#34;Just do it!&#34;Claw said as energy began to collect in his fists. &#34;If we die, we take them with us......&#34;
