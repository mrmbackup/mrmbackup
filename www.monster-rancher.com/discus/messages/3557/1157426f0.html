Hey All, <FONT COLOR="119911">Merry</FONT> <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Christmas</FONT>, and enjoy the next part! <BR> <BR> <BR>Part XIII First Sighting of the Third Soul <BR> <BR><I>“I don’t want to be found! Stay away! You search in vain. If I am found, the Chaos that happened in the past will once again ensue.” <BR> <BR>“I don’t want to be found! Stay away! You search in vain. If I am found, the Chaos that happened in the past will once again ensue.” <BR> <BR>“Go back to where you came from! To come in contact with me is to bring misery to you, your monsters, and the ones you love!” <BR> <BR>“Go back to where you came from! To come in contact with me is to bring misery to you, your monsters, and the ones you love!”</I> <BR> <BR>“Get out of my head!!!” I woke up with a jolt. Sweat was rolling down my face in torrents. That image, that horrible image, I just couldn’t get it out of my mind. It was so sad. I didn’t think monsters cried, but this one was. I couldn’t tell what kind of monster it was. <BR> <BR>“Ack! What’s wrong Jammis? Yeer sweetin’ like a wee piggy.” There was Shamus looking down on me with a worried look on his round face. Horatio, his Owlden, was still pulling the cart. I wondered if he would ever tire out.  Devlin and Stefioni were sleeping on some hay in the back of the cart. Devlin, who was covering Stefioni, as always, was sleeping quietly and Stefioni was making whistling noises of so high a pitch that you could barely hear it.  <BR> <BR>“Shamus, you need to help me! Get this image out of my head! Make it stop, Shamus, make it stop!” I broke down crying, pulling the hair out of my head. <BR> <BR>“Jammis! Jammis! Can you hear me? Hellooo…” I suddenly drifted into a deep sleep. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>I had no clue where I was. It looked sort of like an endless plain, but I couldn’t see very far. I walked for what seemed like hours. Without warning, two figures began to materialize in the distance and rush towards me. As they shot towards me at incredible speeds, I began to make out the features of one of them. It was tall, shiny, and had a long, powerful looking sword. It somehow reminded me of the monster that had been in my dreams; very sad. Although it was at the same distance from me, the other one continued to remain shrouded in the fog that was surrounding everything.  <BR> <BR>They kept charging. Now I was starting to get a bit worried. What did they want? Where was I? Where were Devlin and Stefioni? I had no clue. Then the shrouded one disappeared and the other stopped. Its features were much more visible now. Durahan! That’s what it was! It motioned for me to come towards it. I had no choice. At that moment, I had no control over my body. I came closer, and closer, and closer, until I was face to face with the most glorious and magnificent Durahan I had every laid eyes one. I stretched my hand out to it, but it reeled back in terror. The horrible ranting returned and the Durahan dissipated into thin air. <BR> <BR><CENTER>“I don’t want to be found! Stay away! You search in vain. If I am found, the Chaos that happened in the past will once again ensue.” <BR> <BR>“I don’t want to be found! Stay away! You search in vain. If I am found, the Chaos that happened in the past will once again ensue.” <BR> <BR>“I am the Third Soul, who is not to be sought. Cease your useless quest, or you will be consumed by it.  <BR> <BR>“I am the Third Soul, who is not to be sought. Cease your useless quest, or you will be consumed by it.&#34;</CENTER>  <BR> <BR>I heard these and many others banging around in my head, all at the same time. It was unbearable. I couldn’t escape it! I ran; ran for what seemed like an eternity. I saw in front of me Gavin, in a beautiful garden; Jacques, flying through the air; Hannah, chained and starving; Thomas, lying in some unknown room; Kari, teleporting from place to place with great urgency; and Shamus, with—wait a minute—no, that couldn’t be right! <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>“Jammis! Jammis! C’mon, lad! Wake up! Wake up!” I felt a violent shaking and was immediately returned to my consciousness. I saw Shamus, leaning over me, with a look of great care on his face. Confusion was the order of the day, and I had had my share of it.  <BR> <BR>“No! No! Noooo—oh! Shamus.” I was glad to see this reassuring figure, and real, too. “Are they gone?” <BR> <BR>“What are ye talking about, lad?” He looked just as confused as I was. <BR> <BR>“You mean… you didn’t…see them?” <BR> <BR>“See what? You had fallen into a deep sleep, weeth convulsing an’ everything. Meh and Horatio were terribly worried aboutcha. Ain’t that right, Horatio?” The giant owl only replied with a silent nod.   <BR> <BR>“Then… it was… a dream?” <BR> <BR>“I’m afeared so.” <BR> <BR>“All of it? The mist, the images, the ranting, the… Third Soul. Heeey! I saw the Third Soul! I know what kind of monster it is! The Third Soul is a Durahan!” <BR> <BR>“The Third Soul cam to you in a dream? Weell, laddy, you sure are the first. Are you certain that you saw the Third Soul?” <BR> <BR>“Yeah. It called himself that. It looked very sad…” <BR> <BR>“Never mind that! Do you remember where you were? What did it look like? Maybe that’ll give us a clue as to where it is.” <BR> <BR>“What? How do you know about the Third Soul? I’m starting to think there’s more to you than meets the eye.” <BR> <BR>“Oh, alright, you caught me. I’m the mercenary that Kari hired. Shamus McSkyburg, mercenary extraordinaire! Once again, pleas’d to meet yeh.” <BR> <BR>“Man, how come I’m the only one who never knows anything these days?” <BR> <BR>“Who knows? Maybe you know more than us all!” Shamus said with a wink. “Now, where were you in that dream? If we can find out where you were, maybe that is where the Third Soul is.” <BR> <BR>“But, it looked so sad, and it screamed that it didn’t—“ I was cut short. <BR> <BR>“Oh, come now, finding this thing is key!” <BR> <BR>“Well,” none of this felt right, but I trusted Shamus. “I was on a huge plain that stretched for miles and miles. There was lots of fog, too.” <BR> <BR>“Hmm, the only place like that is the Mikial Plains. Well, since Hyander is no longer a necessity, the Mikial Plains await! Horatio, full speed northwest!” and with that we were off at a blazing speed, heading for the Mikial Ruins, not knowing what would next befall us.

 Shoot! The second time in which the Third Soul screams at James should be in italics, not centered. Sorry about that. I&#39;m still trying to get this whole formatting thing down.
