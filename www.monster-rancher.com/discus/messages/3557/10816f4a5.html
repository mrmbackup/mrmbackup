 Yah, this is me first monster story and…. Well……..I hope I don’t mess up….like I usually do &#42;sigh&#42; So here ya go, hope you enjoy. <BR> <BR>------- <BR> <BR>Some people here believe that monsters with a stronger sub type are considered to be stronger than other monsters. Others believe that Monsters with the same sub type as their main type are not the strongest monsters out there. My opinion? It doesn’t really matter to me. A monster’s a monster. A Dragon’s a Dragon, a Gitan’s a Gitan and so on and so forth. But unfortunately for me, I’m stuck with a monster that doesn’t really like who HE is . . . <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>“Let’s see here . . . draw a little curve there . . . add a few more lines there . . . wha -? Awww, that’s just great. “ The lines on the piece of paper disappear. <BR> <BR>Yeah, Hi. You see that girl over there under that withered old tree? Yeah. That’s me. Cleo Makaru’s my name, and . . . I’m not really sure what’s my game. Huh. Go figure. So yeah, here I am, sitting under this nice ancient tree, on top of some lovely grass, and drawing in my lap an angel. Or what it appears to be. In fact, from my point of view, it looks like a strange punk / gothic angel. Not what I was really going for. Right now, I’m just patiently waiting for – oh, wait, here he comes. <BR> <BR>Walking over the hill, there came a blue and white dog with horns forming from his forehead. A golden pendant wrapped around his neck, while a tan looking sack was on his back. He stopped in front of me and dropped the sack at my feet, small amounts of food spilling out from it. The dog then walked over and sat by my side. I looked at him with confusion. <BR> <BR>“What’s wrong? Usually you dive into the food, head first, might I add.” <BR> <BR>The dog looked straight at me, cocking his head to one side. “Hey, look, I just came back from a mile trip to town and back. Cut me some slack, will ya?” <BR> <BR>“Sorry. Didn’t know you were that tired.” I went back to my pathetic angel drawing. The dog cocked his head next to mine to see my worthless work. <BR> <BR>“Wow, that’s good. Erm, what’s it suppose to be?” <BR> <BR>“Well, it WAS suppose to be an angel, but not anymore.” I said as I was tearing the paper, crunching it up, and tossed it behind my shoulder. <BR> <BR>The dog looked back at the crumpled up paper. “You know, you shouldn’t just throw your art away like that.” <BR> <BR>“Art?!” I chuckled. “More like deformed pieces of crud, is what I say.” <BR> <BR>“Well, just because YOU don’t like it, doesn’t mean everybody will too.” <BR> <BR>“Like you as a normal Tiger?” <BR> <BR>The Tiger stood silent for a moment. Then spoke. “Yah, we need to talk about that . . .” <BR> <BR>“Whatever the reason, no. I won’t allow it.” <BR> <BR>“Whadda mean no?! I’ll become stronger if I have a stronger sub type! In fact . . .” <BR> <BR>“Believe me, you’ll get stronger . . .” <BR> <BR>“Then why hold me back from my decisions?!” <BR> <BR>I turned away from the Tiger’s face. “. . .Like I said, you’ll become stronger, but that’s not all that you’ll gain . . .” <BR> <BR>The Tiger now stared at me with a face of confusion and worry. Plus a little angry tension. “Cleo, I’ve heard that from you about, what, a hundred times? And not once, NOT ONCE, have you told me about that. What do you have to say?” <BR> <BR>I sat silent for a moment. A minute afterwards, I turned to my Tiger. “Because, Jamaru, this isn’t the place to speak of it. Now let’s eat, shall we?” I saw that strange face that Jamaru usually gives me when I’m in that little happy place in the back of my head. Jamaru, finally nodded, and, as usual, dove head first into the pile of food. I, too, was about to grab a delicious looking piece of Mango, when I was cut short by a voice. <BR> <BR>“Oy! Oy, is any one up ‘ere?” A young boy riding on top of what seems like a green dinosaur walked over in my direction. Jamaru, with his mouth stuffed with bread, looked up at the large dinosaur. The duo stopped in front of us. <BR> <BR>“Nice Zuum you got there, boy-o” I finally said. The boy just gave me a smarty like smirk.  <BR> <BR>“Very funny, lil’ girl. ‘ere, this is fer you an’ yer munster there. Goo’day to y’all.” And with that, the boy and his zuum walked off. As Jamaru and I sat there silently, there was still an unopened letter resting in my hands. I shook my self from my trance, and began to open the letter. Jamaru, finally swallowing his food, looked over my shoulder. <BR> <BR>“oooOOOOOooo, what’s that?” <BR> <BR>I took out the letter from within the envelope. As I read it, I gave off a little smirk. “It’s another invitation to a tournament. Maybe we should . . . enter this time?” <BR> <BR>Jamaru gave off a huge grin at the sound of those words. “A tournament?! Ohhh, please, Cleo, can we go? Can we, can we can we? I promise to win some money!” <BR> <BR>I gave out a usual deep sigh. “All right, let’s do it.” <BR> <BR>“All right! YES!!!!” Jamaru started to dance around with a piece of fruit in his mouth. <BR> <BR>“BUT . . .” I snatched the fruit from his mouth. “That means we have to start training. Starting right now!” <BR> <BR>Jamaru gave me a deep shock kind of look. “Right . . . now?” <BR> <BR>“Yeah . . .” <BR> <BR>“ . . . . . . COOL!” After that, he sprinted off. <BR> <BR>“Figures. He’s so hyped up.” I got up from my sitting position. “But still, if he wants to fight and win, we’ll fight . . .and win!” <BR> <BR>------ <BR> <BR>So yah, there it is. &#42;Sarcasm in voice&#42; Isn’t it beautiful? Yah, so anyway, comments are welcomed. I could always use some improving, wouldn’t you agree?;&#41;
