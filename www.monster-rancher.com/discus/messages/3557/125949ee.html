 Roketh and Jace had managed to find and purchase a small ranch outside of a town called Lazar. Jace had managed to get hazard pay out of his former employer&#39;s pocket in exchange for keeping his mouth shut about the ordeal. He happily agreed, with a 1,500,000 G price tag. What choice did they have? Now at the ranch.... <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Come on Roketh! You can get that, right?&#34; Jace screamed at Roketh, who was standing beside a pull drill. It was about half his size. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Must I?&#34; Roketh said picking the weights up by their starps. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;YES! How are you going to beat the Evil when it arrives if you are not strong enough?&#34; Jace screamed towards Roketh. <BR> <BR> <BR>With that, Roketh swung the sligh to the top of the hill in a single stroke before turning and smiling at an awe struck Jace. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Err...scratch the not strong enough part. Well, lets call it a day.&#34; Jace stammered. Fearing that screaming at him anymore would mean he would be at the top of the hill. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Jace...&#34; Roketh said looking at the setting sun. Jace turned to him and saw a fearful look in his eye. &#34;I want you to leave Jace.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Why? You need me remember?&#34; Jace walked over to the massive beast. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t need any friends, not any.&#34; Roketh looked down at the human, &#34;Especially a human. If you were a monster it would be differant.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Jace turned and walked towards the house. As he did he mumbled, &#34;Wait till morning yeah big ofe.&#34; <BR>He turned at the house entrance and yelled towards Roketh, &#34;Get some sleep, I have got something to show you in the morning.&#34; Jace disappeared into the house. Roketh still staring into the setting sun. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t want to lose anyone like I lost Rovest.&#34; He then retreated to his stable. <BR> <BR> <BR>The next day, Jace and Roketh headed into town. People stared in awe at the massive dragon like monster, knowing it was not any breed known. Jace walked over to Dadge, who was freezing a Rocky Fur for some little old lady. Dadge looked up and said cheerfully, &#34;Greetings cousin!&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;How yeah been Dadge? Busy?&#34; Jace said as he shook his hand. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah know it. WOW!&#34; He exclaimed upon seeing Roketh, &#34;What the hell is that breed?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;A new one. Nevermind the new one at the moment. How is Vyger?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;He&#39;s still napping. Shall we wake him?&#34; Dadge said, finally able to take his eyes of Roketh. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank you Dadge. You may do the honor.&#34; Jace said as Dadge lead them to the cryo-chamber which was marked &#39;Vyger&#39;. <BR> <BR> <BR>Dadge went over to a control panel and began flipping switches. Upon pulling a rather large lever, the chamber hissed and opened. Steamed poured out of the opening door. The three stared into the chamber, waiting. By the size of the chamber, Roketh thought it had to be massive. <BR> <BR> <BR>The silence was broken by a remark from Dadge, &#34;So yeah got another...your good.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Roketh didn&#39;t know what he meant until he saw the monster itself. It was about the size of Roketh. In simple terms, big. It was a slightly lighter orange color than Roketh and, once out of the chamber, was a little bit smaller. Not much though. It had three heads and could be described as what is referred to as a Hydra. Each head had a long, single horn coming off the back of its head, and curling into a semi-sythe, pointing forwards. Each had a pair of green, peirceing eyes. Two arms, two legs, and two tails made up the rest of the beast. A well defined torso held them all up. He looked like quite a rough opponent to say the least. Each head began searching, looking around as if to see something recognizable. All three finally set on Roketh. The left head hissed at the monster, and it crouched as if ready to pounce. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Vyger...no...&#34; Jace said calmly, &#34;No hurt...friend.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Roketh could tell by talking to it in such a manner, it must be stupid. That is, until it spoke. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Jace, I&#39;m not a baby. So don&#39;t pull that toddler bullshit with me. Where am I and how long was I out?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Dadge stepped up with some readout info in his hands, &#34;Your in the town called Lazar. You&#39;ve been out for about a year.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Ahh, yes. It is coming back to me now. You went to get some money for my combining. Get it?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Done did. You are a new born, but not a baby. Dadge here fixed it so you&#39;d just be restored, revitalized if you will.&#34; Jace walked over to the Hydra, &#34;I&#39;d go so far as to say reborn.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>After a long walk back to the ranch and being filled in on the events, Vyger said simply, &#34;And you need some help?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes. You are the most powerful monster I&#39;ve ever trained. This goes behond simple tournys and quest for items. Almost like a constant erranty. I remember you saying you wanted to adventure. When Talco showed up you were thrilled. Your were distraught on your return. You said even the errantys were better. More fighting. Well Vyger, here is your chance. What do you say?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Hell yeah I&#39;m in. Eight lords must be heavily guarded, oh yeah. I also heard nothing saying you had to beat the evil on your own. I&#39;m in.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>So the trio went over the montain to their first location, the lake of Tre&#39;nomor. The computer said that the company was going to excavate something there. Rumors said it was a Pressure King. A unique one, possibly the Lord of Water. He may know where to find the other lords. Only time will tell, if he is even there... <BR> <BR> <BR>Enjoy! Chapter 4 is coming up. <BR> <BR> <BR>Note: This is a plot builder. Sorry for the lack of fighting in this one. Anyone thats knows my old stories knows that I put in at least one or two of these. Sorry to disappoint.
