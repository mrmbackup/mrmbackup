&#34;Chase,&#34; the jawa&#39;s voice came over the intercom in the Odd Duck. <BR>	       &#34;Yo.&#34; <BR>	       &#34;Um, can you come here?&#34; <BR>	       &#34;Why?&#34; <BR>	       &#34;I think you need to see this...&#34; <BR>	       &#34;What is it?&#34; <BR>	       &#34;Bad.&#34; <BR>       	Chase let out an exasperated sigh.  He never could get a straight answer out of the jawa when she wanted to be ambiguous. <BR>       	&#34;Alright, I&#39;m on my way.&#34; <BR>       	Chase walked through the halls quickly towards the engineering area, passing by Gramps&#39;s room, where he sat amongst thirteen rabbits, some playing cards, some jabbering about, and one with a cigarette dangling out of his mouth.  Chase shook his head and smiled again, wondering once more how he got this crew of his. <BR>	       Chase entered the engineering room, where Yana ran up to him almost as soon as he entered the room. <BR>	       &#34;Chase!  Quickly, look at this!&#34; <BR>	       &#34;That&#39;s Captain Jericho to you, jawa,&#34; grinned Chase. <BR>       	&#34;Shut it, &#39;Captain,&#39; this is important,&#34; the mechanic retorted as she led Chase to several readout instruments. <BR>       	&#34;Bad,&#34; Chase remarked as he looked at the hyperdrive readout. <BR>	       &#34;Extremely.  Especially since we&#39;re using it right now... at full power.&#34; <BR>       	&#34;Yes.  Very bad... I&#39;d better go tell Bob.&#34; <BR>	       &#34;Good idea.&#34; <BR>	       At just that moment, the intercom speaker in the engineering room came on. <BR>	       &#34;Hey Chase...&#34; <BR>	       &#34;Yeah Bob?&#34; <BR>	       &#34;Um... we have problems...&#34; <BR>	        Chase&#39;s face suddenly was taken over by worry as he looked at Yana, obviously thinking the same thing Yana was. <BR>	       &#34;The hyperdrive,&#34; both blurted out worriedly. <BR>	       &#34;Yeah, how did you know?&#34; the Ewok asked nonchalantly. <BR>	       &#34;Don&#39;t ask!  Yana, stay here, maybe we can fix this.&#34; <BR>	       Yana nodded as Chase ran all the way to the cockpit.  Chase came through the door, finding Bob, Dion and Dan&#39;Tiree all staring worriedly at the console and the numerous warning signals flashing. <BR>	       &#34;Shut off the hyperdrive, now, Bob!&#34; <BR>	       &#34;I can&#39;t!&#34;  <BR>	       &#34;What?!&#34; <BR>	       &#34;It won&#39;t shut off.&#34; <BR>       	&#34;Chase, we&#39;re not on course to Bespin,&#34; Dan&#39;Tiree stated flatly, with the tiniest hint of hidden fear in her voice. <BR>	       &#34;What?&#34; <BR>       	&#34;I can&#39;t tell where we&#39;re going, but the coordinates aren&#39;t Bespin, and they&#39;re not anything I recognize.&#34;  Just at that moment, Yana came running into the cockpit. <BR>	       &#34;What&#39;s wrong, Yana?&#34; <BR>	       &#34;The hyperdrive&#39;s going to go!&#34; <BR>       	&#34;Sh&#42;&#42;!&#34;  Chase yelled as he dove to the console in front of the pilot seat and started pounding buttons wildly. <BR>       	As the ship lurched out of lightspeed, an uncharacteristic flash of white light engulfed the  <BR>ship, almost blinding everyone in the cockpit before suddenly vanishing as the ship dropped completely out of hyperspace and promptly jettisoned the hyperdrive into space.  Chase put the engines to full and attempted to get away out of the blast radius of the about-to-detonate  <BR>hyperdrive before it went up. <BR>       	And very nearly succeeded.
