 The Garu Chronicles <BR> <BR>Chapter 1: The Guardian <BR> <BR>	 A dark-haired boy sat in his room, a leather-bound textbook propped against his pillow.  His attention      began to wane and he tore his eyes away from the page about the Octopee Rebellion.  He picked up his spectacles off  a nearby table and put them on.  The boy got off his bed and stretched to his full height, though this was not  impressive, seeing as he was only 5&#39;5&#34; at age 16.  The rapping of knuckles on his door shook him out of his stupor.   <BR>	&#34;Yeah?&#34; he shouted. <BR>	&#34;Are you done with your history assignment, Scry?&#34;asked his mother.  Scry looked over at the paper.  The words &#34;An Octopee Rampage, by Scry Larken&#34; were all he was able to get down.  Silently he promised himself to finish it when his parents were asleep. <BR>	&#34;Yeah,&#34; he called back.  &#34;You could say that.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Good,&#34; said his mother.  &#34;I need you to run into town and buy some food for Zacharias, you can ride him there if you like.&#34;  Scry perked up at the thought of riding his family&#39;s Beaklon, Zacharias, through the darkening sky.  Scry was pulled from his daydreaming by a loud buzzing in front of him. <BR>	&#34;Heya, Zach!&#34;  The enormous beatle growled happily.  Five minutes later, wind was whipping at his face and some coins jingled merrily in his backpack.  Scry checked his watch; a quarter past five.  Zacharias landed in front of a produce stand and Scry chuckled.  <BR>	&#34;All right, all right, big guy.&#34;  Scry grabbed a dozen carrots and a head of cabbage and handed the man at the register seven silver coins.  Zacharias was crunching down on the cabbage when it happened.  A flash of fire in middair heralded the appearance of a tall jet-black Zan.  It&#39;s crimson eyes flickering in the dimming light, it spotted an old Asian man hobbling to seek shelter.  A pale blonde man cloaked in a trailing gray cape stepped from behind the Zan and yelled:  <BR>	&#34;Oriclese!  What are you waiting for?!  Seize him, I need that talisman!&#34;  As the Zan sped for the old man, Scry&#39;s brain automatically prepared for battle.   <BR>	&#34;Zach!  Block!&#34; he ordered Zacharias.  The Beaklon threw himself into the path of the sprinting Zan and both Monsters were thrown in opposite directions, unconcious.   <BR>	&#34;Fool!&#34; bellowed the pale man.  A knife was pulled from his boot and he ran to the old man.  &#34;Now, Guardian.  I will ask politely one more time.  Give.  Me.  The.  Emblem.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Never,&#34; replied the Asian man defiently.  &#34;You are not fit to own the talisman of your fathers.  Unlike them, you are far to fond of power.  You seek strength so that you may brandish it like a whip on the backs of those who are socially beneath you.  It is my appointed duty to find the ones chosen to weild the powers of the Emblems.  This is the boy this ruby talisman belongs to.  You shall not have it.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Fine,&#34; said the blonde man with a smirk.  &#34;Be that way.&#34;  He threw the knife in his hand and it stuck in the old Asian man&#39;s chest.  He gasped and then fell to the ground.  The pale man turned his gaze to Scry, who felt something cold in his hands.  He looked down to see a ruby embroidered with gold sitting in his palm.   <BR>	&#34;I&#39;ll take that, if you please.&#34; said the blonde man, who was now no more than a foot away.  &#34;My name is Magorian and i would very much like for you to give me that Emblem voluntarily, unless you would like Oriclese to pry it from your dead fingers.&#34;  He snapped his fingers and the black Zan stood up.  It began to walk toward Scry, who was perspiring profusely.  He looked Magorian up and down; the man seemed to ooze wickedness from his very pores.  Scry made to speak, but when he opened his mouth, nothing came out.  He swallowed and replied hoarsely, <BR>	&#34;No.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Pardon?&#34;  asked Magorian. <BR>	&#34;I said no,&#34; said Scry, a little more confidently. <BR>	&#34;Oh,well.  It&#39;s your funeral,&#34; laughed Magorian.  An idea peirced the fog of panic in Scry&#39;s mind.  He dropped the ruby in the dirt and poised his left foot directly above it.  Magorian flung his arm in front of Oriclese, his gray eyes narrowing.   <BR>	&#34;You think you&#39;ve won?  You have merely dug your own grave deeper.  I will return for the Emblem and you life.&#34;  He then whirled his cape around and he dissapeared along  with the Zan and the Asian man&#39;s body in another flash of flame.   <BR>	Scry didn&#39;t remember Zacharias waking, or making it home.  He just remembered the fatigue washing over him and slipping into a long sleep.

 Hey Shea. Only problem I can see is that you need to put a whole line between paragraphs, for &#34;Add a message doesn&#39;t recognize &#34;tab&#34;.
