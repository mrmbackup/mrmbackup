 Once upon a night so teary, <BR>I laid in bed weeping wearily, <BR>Thinking of things oh so dreary, <BR>Things that had made me sad and sore. <BR> <BR>I laid there weeping, <BR>Sleeplessly dreaming <BR>Nightmarish dreams oh so fleeting. <BR>The scars of the prievious hour before. <BR> <BR>When to my left I heard a flutter <BR>And quite faintly there rose a mutter <BR>Oh so softly above the clutter <BR>Scattered across my bedroom floor. <BR> <BR>And now there stooped a shadowy figure, <BR>Rising now with virtuous vigor <BR>That only a Raiden could hopefully rigor <BR>Stading on my cluttered floor. <BR> <BR>I laid there stunned at the sight, <BR>Half in fear half in delight, <BR>Hoping that my horrible plight <BR>Had wrongly been score. <BR> <BR>But soon I realized I was mistaken <BR>&#34;Surely though art not my Raiden. <BR>Some normal Raiden and not my Haven <BR>Who was taken from this world not an hour before.&#34; <BR> <BR>The creature stood, saying not a word, <BR>And soon I grew angry at this bird, <BR>Who, while weeping over my victory once assured, <BR>Swooded in only to stand there silent at my door. <BR>Only stood there and nothing more... <BR> <BR>Until Cried the Raiden: &#34;Never Four.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Now I&#39;m sure you are not Haven. <BR>So tell me now where fair thou Raiden, <BR>Coming in without my sayin&#39; <BR>And what you mean by &#39;Never Four.&#39; <BR> <BR>The Raiden stared and nothing more. <BR> <BR>&#34;Blast you creature! Answer my question!&#34; <BR>I pleaded the Raiden to continue its session, <BR>trying to grasp the meaning of its mention <BR>of the phrase of &#34;Never Four.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Please tell me not my fears ring true, <BR>that my one chance has passed on through. <BR>At its silence came an &#34;ANSWER YOU!&#34; <BR>With the sole purpose of gaining from the beast Something more... <BR> <BR>Cried the Raiden: &#34;Never Four.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you saying that with Haven&#39;s passing,&#34; <BR>I said this now rather rasping. <BR>&#34;That I have no hope of ever grasping <BR>That title sought by all tamers here and yore?&#34; <BR> <BR>Cried the Raiden: &#34;Never Four.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;So are you saying that no monster trained <BR>By my hand can ever there be gained <BR>More than three of the Four so named?&#34; <BR>Silence then and nothing more. <BR> <BR>&#34;Please I beg you, <BR>On my knees, to <BR>Plead this day I do not rue. <BR>Can I not have just one more?&#34; <BR> <BR>Cried the Raiden: &#34;Never Four.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Blasted monster! <BR>Hated creature! <BR>Bird of terrible and monstorous features!  <BR>You deny me the one thing I can not endure!&#34; <BR> <BR>Cried the Raiden: &#34;Never Four.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Never Four! Never Four! Away with you cursed Raiden! <BR>I could care less about my Haven, <BR>For now from me you have taken the one thing I Most adore!&#34; <BR> <BR>Cried the Raiden: &#34;Never Four.&#34; <BR> <BR>In blatent fury I struck <BR>The wretched bird, its feathers I plucked, <BR>But amidst it all a smirk had stuck <BR>Upon the beak of the monster on my floor. <BR> <BR>In a flash it flew from sight, <BR>But within me left all its might <BR>As the memory of that night  <BR>Did leave me with painful memories that I can&#39;t Ignore. <BR> <BR>But still in my profession I fought,  <BR>And still that creatures words, they wrought, <BR>Twisting in my skull they sought <BR>To end my career then and there with their sword Dubbed &#34;Never Four.&#34; <BR> <BR>For I did win never more.

 Yeah, the basis behind this poem is that this guy&#39;s last monster was a Raiden named Haven and he was very close to winning the Big Four tourneys with him, but right before the last one he died. This guy is greedy, however, and doesn&#39;t really care about his monster&#39;s death as much as he does the championship title. His worrying drives him to insanity and the Raiden is basically the symbol of his own doubts, that he will never win every single one of the Big Four. This bears similarities to Poe&#39;s the Raven in that the character is distraught with the death of his lover, Lenore, and goes insane, worrying and thinking that there might not be a heaven and he may never see his Lenore again. The Raven in his poem is basically the embodiement of Poe&#39;s fears as he says there is no afterlife and he will see Lenore &#34;Nevermore.&#34; In other words the Raiden/Raven is actually an illusion and is more or less himself telling himself that his worst fears are true. For example: Say I have a crush on someone but I&#39;m not very confident about asking her out because a little voice in my head says &#34;She probably doesn&#39;t even like you.&#34; The Raiden is that voice.
