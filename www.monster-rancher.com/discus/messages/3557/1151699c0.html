 Yo yo yo!Welcome dudes to my story!!!This is the 2nd chapter of 3.If you want to understand more check out the Prologue and the 1st Chapter of this whole story......... <BR> <BR>After a while of searching for the beast......... <BR>&#34;X.&#34; said Pyro the Garu.&#34;I think that maybe the beast-thing went to another island.&#34; he thought.&#34;Yeah maybe Pyro&#39;s right.&#34; wondered Sneezle the Baku.&#34;I agree.&#34; agreed Fang the Tiger.&#34;Guess you guys are right....I&#39;ve heard that a new island popped outta nowhere.People are calling it the &#34;New Island&#34;.Maybe he&#39;s there.&#34; said X.&#34;Well then let&#39;s go!&#34; said Tiger impaitently.He was getting annoyned and so were the other monsters since they were stuck in a hotel in Ryuwn for around 3 weeks now.&#34;Ok.Besides we need the exercise.&#34; agreed X.He drank the last drops of his lemonade then walked out of the hotel with his monsters.They then walked to the Harbor of Ryuwn.&#34;Hey Rocko!&#34; yelled X.Rocko was the head shipowner since he owned around 20 ships.And Rocko and X were close friends.&#34;Yo!Need anything X?&#34; asked Rocko toughly.&#34;Can I borrow a ship from you?Me and my monsters need a ship to the &#34;New Island&#34;.&#34; asked X back at Rocko.&#34;Sure thing dude!What for?&#34; asked Rocko as he and X walked to one of the ships.X whinned then told Rocko a summary of the story.&#34;I get it.You know I always hated those superstars.They&#39;re always bums.Well you better get goin&#39;!&#34; said Rocko.&#34;Bye!&#34; finished Rocko and he went off to take care of some ship business.&#34;Well let&#39;s go guys!Next stop the New Island!&#34; yelled X.&#34;Hua!&#34; cheered his monsters. <BR> <BR>After 3 days they finally arrived at the shore of the new island…. <BR>“This is it…..you guys ready?!”  said X with courage and pride.”Hua!” replied the 3 monsters&#40;Hua means Ready or let’s Go or Yes!&#41;.The 4 then walked down from their ship.They noticed the sand was softer than the other beaches they gone to.So they went on.After a few minutes they found a forest.They noticed that there was no other way so they walked on through the forest.Soon they found a forest path in the forest which they followed.Suddenly they heard a sound near some bushes.It sounded very soft then soon got louder as they walked on.”I can’t take it anymore!Whoever you are show yourself Coward!” growled Fang.After a few minutes a monster leaped from the bushes.It was a Centaur.”You dare call me,the Centaur Tribe Leader a coward?!Hmmmmmm?!!!!!!!” said the human-horse-like monster angrily.Fang backed a few steps then said “Yeah so what if I called you a coward?!You were acting like one anyway!” said Fang who was now ready to fight.”Fang don’t fight him,he looks strong” whispered Sneezle.”Shut up Sneezle!I can handle anyone and anything!And X….don’t stop me!” said the brave Tiger.”Hahahahaha!” laughed the Centaur.”You fool!You can’t handle me!”.”Oh yeah?Watch me!” growled Fang.he then leaped towards the Centaur’s torso and bit him.”Grrraaaaahhhhhh!!!” yelled the Centaur.He wiggled until Fang finally let go.”You….feel my fury!!!!” said the wounded Centaur.He charged the tiger and hit it on the neck with it’s long spear.Fang was now also wounded but he did not care,he charged up his horns then shot out a stream of lightning towards the Centaur.The Centaur was hit by the lightning and was paralayzed and shocked for a few seconds.”Huuuh….huuh…huuh” panted both monsters.Fang was still up for more fighting but the Centaur was now badly wounded and still a bit shaky.The Centaur did it’s best to keep up with the tiger’s power but it was too strong for him.”I…surrender…” said the Centaur weakly.He kneeled down on his front 2 feet and did  a quick bow to the tiger.”What?!You’re giving up!Why?!You…you’re no leader.A true leader would stand and fight until his very last breath….no wait not a leader..a monster!You don’t deserve to be called a monster!!!” growled Fang.”Fang!Don’t be like that!” scolded X.”Psh!” groaned Fang as he took the lead and walked on.Soon the 4 left the Centaur without saying a word and walked on.Soon they felt their stomachs mumbling…they were hungry.”Ouhhhhh!!! moaned the 3 monsters.”What are we gonna eat?!” asked Pyro furiously.”Don’t worry” but before X could finish his sentence 2 Centaurs blocked their path.”We are of the Centaur Forest Tribe.Come with us.” Said the 2 Centaurs at the same time.”Woah!We don’t want to fight we just got into one a while ago.” explained X.”Not required.We came here to welcome you 4 to our village.Our Prince requests your presence.” said the 2 Centaurs at exactly the same time again.”Well ok.” said X curiously.”Let’s go guys”.The other monsters nodded.But Fang just followed angrily.When they got there they saw many Centaurs doing town stuff:Fighting in Tournaments,Buying and Selling Stuff,Walking around,etc.”Woah!Looks like a town!” said Sneezle surprised.”Wrong.Only a village.We have not yet reached the limits of a village so it’s not yet a town.” corrected the 2 Centaurs once again at the same time.”Uhhh…..we can take it from here.We’ll got to the Leader’s Hut after we’ve freshened up a bit.” explained X.When the Centaurs left the 3 monsters happily said all at the same time “Finally!” then laughed.The 4 then watched a few Centaurs battle it out at a small stage.The 4 saw Centaurs different shapes,looks,color and sizes!The 4 were all very amazed but soon they remembered that they had to meet with the Prince.They quickly ran towards the Elder’s Hut.They slowly opened the curtains which was to Centaurs,a door and saw an old Centaur and a mid-aged Centaur.”You’re late.” said the old Centaur.”But that’s ok.My son told me about you.Allow me to introduce me and my son.I am the Eldest Centaur,,Gozimbo and the leader of this tribe.And he is my son,the Prince of our tribe,Elmonte.” he explained.”Prince?We thought that HE was the leader.” said X.“He told us that he was the Centaur Tribe Leader.”.”Oh!Oh hohohohohoh!You see my friends my son really wants to take my place so I told that I WILL give him my place when he is ready.But because of his eagerness he often forgets that I am still the leader.” Explained the Great Centaur Leader.”Bah!You’re just an old centaur!” yelled the Centaur Prince at his father.After a few moments of staring at each other the prince left his father’s hut and ran off back into the forest.”Oh dear.Not again.” Worried the old centaur.”Why?What’s wrong?Is he gonna leave or something?” asked X.”Well you see sometimes he gets so mad when I say that I am the leader.The only thing that will calm him down is if he gets defeated by a monster.Well anyways tell me young ones.Why are you here on this island?” said the old centaur.”Wait guys,I’ll go after that Centaur.I’ll talk some sense into him.” Exclaimed Fang.”What?!” said Pyro,Sneezle and the old centaur all at the same time.”Let him.” said X in a low voice.”Huh?But….” but before Sneezle could finish his sentence X made a sign that made Sneezle shut up.”Go if you want to.I know that you’re the only one who can stop that Centaur….show him a monster should act!” said X now in a whole-heartedily manner.Fang just nodded,smiled then ran off.”.”Now back to our story.” said X.”You see I am a breeder…” said X.And X told the centaur leader everything.”Ah I understand now.You see there was also creature who attacked our village 2 days ago.And I know what that creature.I’ll tell you a story.” exclaimed Gozimbo.”You see 150 years ago there was a war.A war between the people of Togle and Ryuwn.Togle had many strong monsters on their side like Durahans and Dragons but Ryuwn had weak but very smart monsters.So it was like a fair match in many ways.20 years had past but the war continued.But soon a monster of unbelievable strong was born because of the long war also known as…the “1000 Year War”.But then Pyro barged in.“I don’t get it.If it was only 20 years how come it was called the thousand year war???” asked Pyro.”Do not worry my boy you will as my story goes further.Now this monster was very powerful he was called “Killecko”.People named him like this because this monster killed millions of people during their time.Now this monster was first found by a group of scientists.They found it at an island east of Ryuwn.And that island is the very island we are stepping on right now.Now,Killecko was a baby that time.But the scientists were very eager to study it so they took it to their campsite.Which....was in the middle of war,at Togle.Many things happened there and the baby monster saw only 1 type of thing,fighting.It saw killing,blood sheading and many more.Until it grew into an evil monster.30 years past and now the monster was bigger than ever.The war ended and Togle scientists kept the Killecko in a cage.But the strong Killecko had now developed 2 things.Power and the urge to kill.....it broke out of it&#39;s cage one night....and by morning the whole town where it was kept was burned to ashes.It took a while but Togle was rebuilt.But while the survivors were building Ryuwn was destroyed too.For years they rebuilt but then it was destroyed over and over again.But then 1 day after 50 years of battle with the Killecko a young boy was brave enought to go the Killecko and tell him &#34;You Demonking!Stop destroying our town!&#34;.But the beast just blasted a fireball at the boy.The boy then changed form and became a holy phoenix.The boy was then called &#34;Lightix&#34;.Te boy looked like the other phoenix Killecko but was color white while the Killecko was color red,orange and black.They both showed their powers to each other and fought until their very last breath.Then the boy said &#34;I give up,Deathking but we shall show you ouuuurr...our...ou...rr..powe.rr....Deaa..thdboll....deaaa...thhbal...deeaat....daaaannnubivn.....&#34;.But before he could finish his sentence the boy fell to the ground and never spoke again.Because of the boy we now call the Killecko as Annuvin,the Deathlord.Now why didn&#39;t the dark phoenix finish us years ago,because he was too weak.It took him that long to heal himself and too make himself stronger.And now he&#39;s back for revenge.Revenge since he humilated himself infront of us but he blames us for it.You must stop him before death shines upon earth!!!!&#34; said the old centaur,Gozimbo.Gozimbo then stood up and told X something very very surprising he told X his very last words before....&#34;X,death is upon me.....may you and your monsters live longer than I.Please teach my son....the riiii..ghtt.....waa..wy.....&#34;.After the message the old centaur just fell to the ground.&#34;May your soul rest in peace.&#34; said X sadly.&#34;Come on guys...lets go.&#34;.After exiting the hut they told the people of the village which made their faces sad.&#34;So what do we do now?&#34; asked Sneezle.&#34;We&#39;re gonna save ourselves,our country and most importantly our world from Annuvin!!!!!&#34; yelled X.&#34;Hua!&#34; yelled the monsters and off they went to the cliffs of the island to meet up with Fang......... <BR> <BR>Chapter 2 End <BR>To be continued........... <BR>&#40;Well dudes?What do you think?Give me comments or suggestions if you like!&#41;

 I&#39;ll peg you on a note that torey nailed me with early in my writing stages, quote &#34;Slightly shorter paragraphs would help me follow the action better.&#34; <BR> <BR>I have to agree, breaking your chapters into smaller paragraphs does help keep a certain rhythm and flow to it. <BR> <BR>That is not even a bad thing, just a suggesstion, your work is pretty good, imo. Look forward to more.
