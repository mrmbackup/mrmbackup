 Two dark shapes exploded out of the forest toward the nearest town, traveling alongside the nearest river. Then silence. <BR> <BR>Birds cried out and fled as minutes later another large shape came out of the forest, sending up spray as it plowed along in the water. <BR> <BR>All was silent once again. <BR> <BR>-- -- --- -- --- ---- --- --- --- <BR> <BR>X turned around as lightning suddenly light up the sky in an irregular series. Something was wrong. <BR> <BR> Turning back toward the source of the unnatural light, he counted his teammates. Six out of nine.   <BR> <BR>He wasn’t surprised.  <BR> <BR>The Antlan spoke. “You’ve noticed that they are gone, then?” <BR> <BR>X turned. “We must go back. I fear that Garrett has betrayed us.” <BR> <BR>“Well than why not move on before he can catch up with a larger force?” <BR> <BR>“Because we left the rest of our tiny group at his house. I fear that what he is fighting back in town are the remaining members.” <BR> <BR>Realization took hold in the monsters. They stood stock still for a moment.  <BR> <BR>When the next lightning flash came, there was no one there. <BR> <BR>-- -- -- -- <BR> <BR>The tiger danced around globs of deadly water as the hare beside him simply punched the projectiles.  <BR> <BR>Running out from behind the protection of the hare, it submerged its horns in the lake that now engulfed the town that used to be there. “LIGHTNING!”  <BR> <BR>True to his word, lightning streaked down from the sky and charged his horns, which then discharged the pent up electricity into the lake.  <BR> <BR>The Lesione in the middle of the lake stopped firing water guns from behind its shelter of two collapsed buildings. It roared in pain and anger as the tiger channeled more and more lightning into the lake.  <BR> <BR>Deciding to take a different tactical angle, it jumped on top of a building and shot a water boomerang out of its mouth, hitting the tiger directly on the horns. It flew back several meters and landed, bloody and unconscious, on a rock nearby.  <BR> <BR>The Lesione laughed playfully in a seal like voice and resumed its barrage of the hare. Only there was a small problem. The hare wasn’t there.  <BR> <BR>Confused, The watery assassin turned around to see two feet come at it. Diving off the buildings, it got clipped on the head and spun into the water. It submerged a couple of meters away and laughed again. Then its eyes glowed red. <BR> <BR>“NOT AGAIN!” cried the hare.  <BR> <BR>A 50-foot wave rose out of the lake and buried the hare under tons of water. Sure of the little bunny’s death, the Lesione flapped its flippers about playfully. Until it felt the foot long daggers at the back of head and its throat.  <BR> <BR>Now it was the hare’s turn to laugh. So it did. Then it made the fatal slit and collapsed onto a floating slab, too tired to move.  <BR> <BR>“Bad move, bunny,” cackled an evil voice. The Joker watched as the hare looked at him in horror, too tired to give fight. It closed its eyes. The evil clown lifted his scythe and brought it down in an execution like manner. <BR> <BR>“CLANG swish CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG…” <BR> <BR>The hare opened his eyes to find himself alone on his slab of rock. A couple of buildings away a brawny Antlan with a golden sword dueled with the Joker, who had a slash in its cape. <BR> <BR>Soft hands helped the Antlan up. Looking behind him, he saw a pixie tending to him. “Life Trade.” <BR> <BR>Energy from the pixie flowed into the hare. Revitalized, he turned around and recognized Amazon. <BR> <BR>“Amazon? Is that you?” <BR> <BR>“Yup. Do you think you can swim to shore, Calibur?” <BR> <BR>“No problem.” <BR> <BR>“Alright.” <BR> <BR>Amazon flew off to where Shadow, the tiger, lay, surrounded by X, Pressure, and now Amazon. Blaze stood a little farther away, fearful of the damage his flames could cause. <BR> <BR>Turning around to the other side of the lake, Calibur saw that Inferno was fighting with that weird Dragon that followed Garrett around, named Slash or something. He watched as Inferno ripped off Slash’s head. <BR> <BR>Then he saw Garrett, the traitor, calmly sitting on a rock nearby. Infuriated, The hare stood up. The little man had caused almost everyone back at the manor to be killed. HE had to have revenge.  <BR> <BR>Dashing across the various slabs and buildings, he jumped from the building nearest to the shore, jumping farther than ever before.  <BR> <BR>Garrett looked up from his computer screen to see a flaming fist coming at him. He was instantly unconscious.  <BR> <BR>As Calibur was about to deliver the final blow, he realized that the group still needed information from Garrett.  <BR> <BR>The hare dragged the body across to the other side of the lakeshore, unceremoniously dumping him at X’s feet.  <BR> <BR>Without looking at the other monster’s reactions, he stumped off to a nearby tree and fell asleep as if drugged.  <BR> <BR>The Antlan slashed in a never- ending combo at the Joker, not letting the clown get a chance to attack. <BR> <BR>The Joker roared with frustration at having to parry stroke after stroke, and decided upon more drastic measures. Reaching into the dark underworld, he pulled out the sword called the DarkTerror. A dark circle formed under his feet and burst into a ring of dark flame around the Joker as the sword materialized in his hand, just in time to block a thrust.  <BR> <BR>“No!” cried the Antlan. “I will not allow that sword to be drawn! It contains too much evil, so much that you do not realize the extent of its powers, boy!” <BR> <BR>A hole opened in the sky and light poured down from the heavens. The Antlan called upon supernatural powers to give him strength as the beam focused upon him. A sword made of pure white crystal appeared and he grew to 3 times his original size. <BR> <BR>“I am the Guardian! I will not let my work go to waste! Put the sword away!” <BR> <BR>“NO.” The Joker’s voice was deep and evilly commanding as it, too, grew, although only twice as high, it was enough to reach the height of the Antlan.  <BR> <BR>“My master has let me borrow the sword to destroy you, and only you, Guardian! Fear it’s dark might!” <BR> <BR>“So he is your master! You have allied yourself with evil incarnate, dog!” <BR> <BR>With those words the two entered into combat, one in bright shining light, the other cloaked in Darkness. <BR> <BR>The Crystal sword crashed against the black one as the two tried to overpower the other.  <BR> <BR>Suddenly, the Antlan spun around the Joker and slashed a deep gash in its cape.  <BR> <BR>“FOOL!” The Joker punched the Antlan and punted the Guardian onto another slab. <BR> <BR>“I have been infused with the power of one of my master’s elite minions. You will never defeat me, and you will never defeat them!” <BR> <BR>“Shut up.” <BR> <BR>Jumping back onto the Joker’s slab, the Antlan swung the crystal sword in graceful slashing movements. <BR> <BR>Noticing his cape was being cut up, the Joker jumped away. Laughing, he tore the rest of his cape to pieces.  <BR> <BR>The Antlan watched, confused, as a purple mist rolled out of the Jokers body and a black tornado formed, the Jokers mask swirling around in it. “HAHAHA! Fear the tornado of DeAtH!” <BR> <BR>The Antlan smiled, suddenly knowing what to do. He flung the crystal sword inside of the tornado. To everyone’s surprise, it exploded, sending beams of light shooting uncontrollably out of the wild tornado. Finally, the winds died down. <BR> <BR>In its place was the crystal sword, stuck inside of the DarkTerror. The dark sword disappeared in a swirling dark vortex from the underworld at the same time that the light sword disappeared in a beam of light.  <BR> <BR>The Antlan jumped over to shore and walked up to Calibur. “Hello, my name is Caduceus. What is yours?” <BR> <BR>None noticed the dark figure standing in the center of the lake, floating on the water. <BR> <BR>“So, you have won yet again, and have found the Guardian. I congratulate you, for you are indeed a worthy adversary. But it’s time to end this game, my little escapee.” <BR> <BR>He disappeared in a whirlpool of black water.

 Wow. I missed this installment. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re improving. Congratulations. The only suggestion I have is to use different descriptions for the crystal sword, as seeing &#39;the crystal sword&#39; gets repetitive. <BR> <BR>Nicely done.
