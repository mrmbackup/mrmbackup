 Icelord here. I&#39;m drawing a blank on where I should go with The MDA, so I decided to start a new epic. I hate to say it, but I like it better than MDA &#40;gasp&#41;. Oh well, at least I know you&#39;ll enjoy it. The new epic&#39;s called Open Wounds. <BR> <BR>Open Wounds Chap 1: Day of Destiny <BR> <BR>“ATTACK!” <BR> <BR>The villagers scattered as a troop of Durahan poured into the village. The sound of metal colliding with ground as the Durahan trampled the market in the center of the town. Shops where all had bought there food from were now but piles of ruble. Windows shattering and people screaming as their throats were slashed. Blood sprayed across the walls of the town as voices were silenced forever.  <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, I stood at the top of the gorge, watching as the people of Kamedore were slaughtered. The once vibrant marble statues now smeared with blood, cadavers fell limp into the mud. And yet I watched, watched this horrible tragedy. I could not bring myself to help this lost cause, until I saw something that tapped into my conscience. <BR> <BR>“Help me, please!” <BR> <BR>The little girl’s scream rang out above all else as she was cornered against a building, about ten feet away stood a Curevis. Its orange armor shown brilliantly against the morning sun. It stood above the little girl, with no mercy, and began the sword’s descent. <BR> <BR>I raced for that girl with all my speed, all my energy. The sword was crashing abnormally fast as I raced through a dark alley, hoping, no, praying I would make it in time. I drew my sword as I exploded out of the alley, engaging the Curevis. I jumped off of my horse, and began the duel of life and death.  <BR> <BR>Sparks flew free as metal crashed upon metal. The Curevis’ armor reflected the light into my eyes and I was blind, swinging my sword wildly. I must have hit, fore when I opened my eyes, the minute my pupils had adjusted to the light, I saw only an orange pile of scrap metal. <BR> <BR>The girl was unconscious, and I picked her up. But just as I jumped onto the horse, I saw a Vesuvius at the end of the alley. He yelled for back-up, and soon a line of Durahan came into view. However, these Durahan were different. Instead of swords, these Durahan had bows, with a full quiver at their sides. The stretched the drawstrings, each cradling an arrow, and let them fly as my horse scampered for the exit. I let out a shriek as an arrow sailed into my left leg, and a stream of blood began to flow down the horse and stain the streets. <BR> <BR>“This isn’t good,” I muttered, still in immense pain, “Now they have a trail to follow me.” <BR> <BR>The horse bolted out of the village and into the forest. I had saved the girl, but could not save her village. However, my leg was still bleeding, and I could hear the pounding of the Durahan in pursuit. <BR> <BR>“I have to stop and tend to my wound,” I thought, “Then I can continue.” <BR> <BR>But where? Where was I to go? If I stopped, they’d find me. I continued on. The sound of the pounding metal feet grew louder, and so did my heartbeat. I was scared now. Running for my life, I felt the beads of sweat flow down my face, just as the blood flowed from my leg. Then, I realized it. <BR> <BR>I looked at the wrapping around my hands; I had worn them all my life. In the code of my people, I was never to take them off, but I felt I could make an exception in this case. And also because, I was not part of that tribe anymore. I put my arm to my face and began to undo the bandages. Now a length of wipe wrapping streaming from my mouth, I took my hands off of the horse. I could die if I fell off, but if I was caught, that was another story. <BR> <BR>I took the wrapping out of my mouth and began to tie the bandage to my leg. I made a firm knot, and pushed hard. By applying pressure, I could stop the bleeding. After about twenty minutes of non-stop galloping, the bleeding slowed, then ceased. The trail was gone, and I swerved into the woods. <BR> <BR>I realized then I had gone down a cliff. As the horse ground its hooves into the dirt, I began to accumulate scratches and bruises. The thorns were unmerciful, and the branches whipped me like a slave. I felt it now, and the beautiful white coat of the horse was now streaked with blood. Just as I was about to lose hope, we came into a clearing. <BR> <BR>A vast field of tall moss covered the landscape. I jumped off the horse, and pulled an ointment out of the saddlebag. I applied it to my cuts; it stung like a wasp from the moment it laid its cool hands on my face. I quickly wrapped my face in a loin clothe, and jumped onto the horse. I took the girl in my hands, and checked her pulse. There was nothing; I thought she was dead. When I was just about to toss her limp body aside, I felt it. A slight beat in her neck, a pulse. I picked her up, slapped the horse, and made my way through the fields. <BR> <BR>The moss was up to my eyes, and tickled as I passed through. Moving swiftly; we made it to the end of the small valley and into another forest. I leaped off the horse, put my ear to the ground, and felt the shuddering. It was very slight, and I knew then that the Durahan were out there, but on the wrong course.  <BR> <BR>Knowing I had lost them, I slowly mounted the horse, and it pranced off into the wilderness. <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>The fire crackled in the middle of the caverns. I sat by it, watching its every move. Then, it erupted into my mind. <BR> <BR>I could hear desperate screaming. <BR> <BR>“Help me! No, please! Ahhhh!” <BR> <BR>I held my hands to my head, it was unbearable. I felt the beating of my head, like a loud drum. Why does this haunt me? I had escaped, I had won. Why do I live with this torture? <BR> <BR>“Uh.” <BR> <BR>I turned my head to the back of the cave where I had set the girl to rest. She was stirring, and I knew she’d be hungry. I walked to the horse, and dug into the saddlebag. I removed a pot, a ladle, and two bowls. I poured some fodder into a bag, and strapped it around my horse’s mouth. She began to munch, and was happy for a meal after her dash across the countryside. I took out some carrots, celery, and a few noodles that I had purchased in Dorian, the previous town. I had stopped for provisions in Kamedore, when I found it under siege. <BR> <BR>I place the pot over the crackling fire, happy to have muffled the pain of the visions, and poured some water into it. When the water boiled, I threw in the celery and the carrots into the mix. Their flavors seeped into the water, and became a light vegetable soup. I tasted it, and then poured some into each bowl. The girl moaned, and then opened her eyes. <BR> <BR>“WH-Where am I?” she asked softly, still very weak. <BR> <BR>“Don’t worry,” I assured her, “You’re safe now. Here, I made you some dinner.” <BR> <BR>I handed the bowl to the girl. She lifted her hand, and took the bowl, still very weak. She eagerly began to drink, and soon asked for more. I gave it to her, knowing she had had a rough time. I was still unable to tell her about her village. I did not wish to put such a burden on her already heavy shoulders. The fire crackled under the pot, and I looked around at the cave walls. The walls of this cave were very strange. They were smooth, and seemed to be hollowed out. I didn’t find it much of a threat, and just kept eating. <BR> <BR>“What’s you r name?” I asked the little girl. <BR> <BR>She looked up at me, with her blue eyes and brown hair. She was indeed beautiful, and I could tell by her innocent expression she had never seen combat; or even death before. She shuddered. <BR> <BR>“It’s okay,” I said, trying to ease her pain, “It’s always hard the first time. The art of war is one of the most terrifying things to comprehend.” <BR> <BR>“I know,” she replied, “I’m okay, just a little cold.” She shuddered again, and I could see her teeth chattering. I went to the saddle bag, and fetched a wool blanket I had owned for a long time. Then, it happened again. <BR> <BR>I could see the wool, covered in blood. My father, on the ground with his head in the corner of the room, and my mother lay pathetically strewn across the floor. She looked up, blood running form her mouth. <BR> <BR>“Take it,” she urged, “You must leave this place.” <BR> <BR>I fell to the ground as the vision ended. I was hyperventilating, and son felt the beads of sweat form on my brow. I looked up at the girl. I had obviously cried out, fore she looked at me as if I were mad. I smiled. <BR> <BR>“I’m sorry,” I muttered, still out of breathe, “I didn’t mean to frighten you.” <BR> <BR>She looked calm, but not reassured. She took a deep breathe, and then smiled. <BR> <BR>“By the way,” she said, “My name is Aurora.” <BR> <BR>“Aurora,” I repeated, “That’s a very beautiful name.” <BR> <BR>She smiled, and gratefully accepted the blanket, as I gratefully gave it up. She curled into a ball, and went to sleep. <BR> <BR>I went to the mouth of the cave, and looked to the sky. I saw it. The northern lights lay thrown across the sky. I looked into the patchwork quilt that was the sky. <BR> <BR>“Aurora,” I whispered, and went back down into the cave. I looked upon the girl one more time, and then drifted into sleep. <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>“Tweet! Tweet! <BR> <BR>I awoke to a chorus of birds at the mouth of the cave, singing their song in unison. The girl was till asleep, and I got up. I realized something I had never noticed before. A knapsack lay across from the girl. It was brown, and tattered. I could tell it had been used frequently.  <BR> <BR>I tip toed over to the bag, careful not to wake Aurora. I picked up the bag, and felt it. There was something round inside. I undid the strings that bound the small bag closed. I opened the top, and pulled out the contents. I couldn’t believe my eyes. <BR> <BR>“A Saucer Stone,” I whispered.    <BR> <BR>Aurora woke, when she looked upon me, her eyes shot open. <BR> <BR>“No!” she screamed and torn the Saucer Stone from my hands and held it to her chest. She was only about ten, but still had an attitude. <BR> <BR>“Why did you look through my stuff? This is my Saucer Stone, and you can’t have it!” She yelled in rage. <BR> <BR>“Easy there,” I said calmly, “I don’t want your Stone.” <BR> <BR>She still seemed a bit edgy, but fell to the ground. She looked up with innocent eyes. <BR> <BR>“I’m sorry,” she said, “The only thing I’ve ever wanted was to breed monsters. In fact, I found this stone three years ago in my backyard. Ever since, I’ve waited for the day when I could regenerate it. In fact today is the day.” <BR> <BR>I looked up at her, with sympathy as a tear ran down her cheek. She knew her village had been destroyed; I didn’t even have to tell her. She started to cry, and I tried to comfort her. <BR> <BR>“It’s okay,” I began, “I’ll take you to the shrine in the next town. We can register you, and regenerate your monster. In fact, I need more food. We don’t even have enough for breakfast.” <BR> <BR>With that, she packed her bag, and mounted the horse. I jumped on behind her. <BR> <BR>“What’s her name?” asked Aurora. <BR> <BR>“Her name? Why, her name is Aikuchi.” <BR> <BR>“And, um,” she seemed hesitant, “What’s your name?” <BR> <BR>“I am known as Drake.” <BR> <BR>With that, I, Aurora, and Aikuchi dashed out of the cave and into the morning sun, anxious to know what the future had in store for us.
