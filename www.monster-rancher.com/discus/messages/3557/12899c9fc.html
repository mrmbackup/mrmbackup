 Note:At home I have created several MR stories on paper IE th Ancient World Chronicles. These stories are sort of an origin to the MR world and are losely based on the events in MR2. This, to me, is the most exciting, so I decided to post it first. Here it is, enjoy. <BR>           <BR> <BR>      The convoy ship floated in the orbit of the big blue rock known as planet No.0680. All contact with the previous test party had been lost. After five centuries, a new research team had been assembled. <BR>      The team consiststed of the prototype cannon fodder of the Martian race, Metalners. Each one was designed to follow orders no matter what and had been specifically trained for this sort of recon missions. Aside from the metalners, another prototype lay in stasis. This new creature was the latest test experiment from Martian project 994. The project in which creatures used for massive takeover plans were born from DNA gathered from the galaxy. This creation, titled MONOL was a main in this mission. For with it lay two crystal orbs, one golden, one black, both could destroy an entire world. <BR>       Suddenly, a red light blazed on in the cockpit of the ship. A humongous dark object loomed obove the craft. The meteor had been in the atmosphere of the planet for years, it had been the doom of the previous invaders. It seemed to pass right over the vessel with out damage. The aliens breathed a sigh invain. A piece of debris flew from the meteor and struck the craft. The lights darkened, the alarm stopped, and the artificial ice began to melt around the frozen Monol. <BR>       Test subject No. 354, code named Monol awoke to a stataling jolt. He lurched forward and fell on to the floor. Two crystal orbs flew at his helpless form. They collided with one another and semmed to form one. The orbs hit him square in the face. A bright light blinded his vision. He felt naucious, and felt his body being ripped in two. Then he blacked out and saw no more.    <BR>       The metalners stared in awe at the whole event. Their artificial minds trying to compute what was happening. On the ground where the creation had been lay two round objects. One was golden shaped like a sun full of rays. The other was silver, shaped like a cresent moon. But their pondering would soon be over. At that moment, the ship entered the atmosphere. The metal alloy began to disiagrate. Their was a scream. And then their was silence, as two objects of destruction fell to the ground below.

 The story&#39;s good, but it is, indeed jumbled. ...Feels like it needs spell-check. It bothers me when I see something misspelled, no offense.

 Thanks for reading. There&#39;s still eight more chapters if you think you&#39;re interested. They aren&#39;t as jumbled, but as for spelling I&#39;m not sure.
