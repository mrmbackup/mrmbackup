 Alright here is chapter 2.  It&#39;s not perticularly well written because i&#39;m on a very tight schedual and sorry for the wait.  Hope you enjoy it. <BR> <BR> Chapter 2: The Mad Man <BR> <BR>	It was morning.  The storm blew out and the dew glistened beautifully in the grass.  The sun shone through the window of the room.   <BR> <BR>“Well I guess it’s time to get ready,” Wes said, not even knowing if Fury was awake.  He looked over to see Fury curled up on the floor.  Wes popped out of bed then headed toward the bathroom.  On the way over he scratched Fury on the head.  That woke him up. <BR> <BR>“Don’t do that,” Fury began, ”I’m not your pet.”  Wes just ignored him.   <BR>	 <BR>	A few minutes later Wes began to suit up for there long day ahead.  He slipped into his black pants, brown leather boots and gloves, large blue shirt, and slicked back his short spiky brown hair and slung his short sword into he’s belt.  He was happy that his clothes dried out from the dreadful rain.   <BR>	 <BR>Fury groomed his long pointed blue coat.  He already began through the hallway and out the door.  Wes rushed out and caught up with Fury. <BR> <BR>“So,” Wes began, “we gonna try for a tournament or take another job?” <BR> <BR>“I feel like I can take a tournament,” Fury replied, sounding happy that Wes asked. <BR> <BR>“K’ then, I’ll check out the local posts,” Wes said.  He then began to turn toward the small shop center, then he turned and told Fury, “I’ll meet you back here in a while.” <BR> <BR>Wes looked around for any boards or posts that might say anything about any kind of tournament.  He saw one piece of paper hung up on a wooden overhang post on a small shop.  He read: <BR> <BR>“Saturday- Free For All Tournament- Dark Wood City- Dark Wood Arena- ALL ARE WELCOME! <BR>1st Prize- 2,000 Gold and monster disc <BR>2nd Prize- 500 Gold <BR>3rd Prize-50 Gold and a coupon for Mal’s Monster Mart “THE BEST FOR YOUR MONSTER” “ <BR> <BR>That’s good, thought Wes.  Now if I can figure out where Dark Wood City is at I’ll be set.  Wes decided to check with the shopkeeper of the shop he was in front of.  He walked inside to see that it was a small shop that mostly sold medicine.  A small middle-aged baled man with glasses was perched on a wooden stool behind the counter. <BR> <BR>	“Excuse me,” began Wes, “do you know where I might find Dark Wood City at?”  The small man looked up at Wes through his large glasses and said in a simple manner, <BR> <BR>	“North 5 miles.”  Wes gave the man a puzzled look then headed out to get Fury.  Wes took his time on the way back to their meeting site, he was interested in some of the things he saw, took in the sights, smells and sounds of the busy market. <BR>	 <BR>	Wes reached the meeting point, a couple yards from the inn that they had spelt in the other night.  No Fury.  Wes looked around for a couple seconds then called out, <BR> <BR>	“Fury!  Hey, Fury!” Wes then heard something quickly running toward him.  Wes looked to see Fury running toward his direction with incredible speed. <BR> <BR>	“Run Wes!” is all Fury said, quickly passing by Wes and heading toward the inn.  Wes looked in the direction that Fury came from and saw a tall blonde kid that looked like he was no more the 15 and with him was a black dino.   <BR> <BR>	The two didn’t even bother to change direction and looked as if they might trample Wes. <BR> <BR>	“Ah dang!” Wes yelled as he ran toward the way Fury did.  He ran behind the inn to see Fury waiting for him. <BR> <BR>	“Follow me!” Fury said sternly, then began to run along the back of the row of shops that lined the area.  Fury and Wes didn’t bother to see if the other two were still following. <BR> <BR>	“What the heck did you do this time?!” Wes asked while struggling to keep up with Fury. <BR> <BR>	“They started it!” Fury exclaimed.  <BR>	“Yeah they always start it!” replied Wes. <BR>	“They did!” snapped Fury, as he turned into one of the allies.  Wes nearly passes right by, not expecting Fury’s turn, then he quickly stopped turned and caught up again, as he did he saw the dino and the blonde guy weren’t really that far behind. <BR> <BR>	“Hey come back here coward!” yelled the blonde guy. <BR> <BR>Wes and Fury were now running through the crowds of people through the market.   <BR> <BR>	“When we make it to the end here we turn left!” shouted Fury. <BR>	“Then we’ll end up headed down the same place!” Wes yelled back. <BR>	“That’s the point!” replied Fury.  As they got out of the actual market square Wes and Fury turned left and around the corner of a building…to see they were beaten there. <BR>	 <BR>	“Took you long enough,” stated the blonde guy.  Fury stood his ground, as did Wes.  Fury growled and the hair on his back stood on end.  Now that Wes had time to look at the blonde guy he noticed something familiar about him, his red button up shirt, his white pants and his short white jacket.  It was the guy responsible for the incident that brought Fury and Wes together. <BR>	 <BR>	What happened was that this guy broke into a shop in the middle of the night and wreaked it.  Wes was just arriving into the town when the blonde guy bumped into Wes and scattered all the assorted stuff that was stolen from the shop.  The blonde guy called Wes a stupid clumsy bum and started to push Wes around.  When Wes decided that enough was enough and he punched the guy in the jaw.  The blonde guy got ticked off and drew his broad sword.  This is when Fury came in.  Fury ran up and knocked the blonde guy on the ground, disarming him of his weapon.  Wes didn’t know where Fury came from or why he helped him.  All he knew was to run and get the constable.  Once everything was resolved, Fury was put into jail with the blonde guy.  So figuring he owed the tiger something he convinced the constable to let Fury out.  Fury explained that he just had a hard history with the blonde guy, that he wasn’t trying to help Wes.  But the two traveled together.  <BR> <BR>	“Hunter!” barked Fury. <BR>	“Heh.  I’m flattered that you remembered me,” Hunter said back, remaining completely calm. <BR>	“Hey look guys we don’t have to fi…” Wes began, but then was cut off with a loud “Shut up!” from Hunter and Fury.  Hunter stepped back then calmly said, <BR>	“Ash, take care of them.”  With that the black dino stepped back a little then with lighting speed dashed forward toward Fury.  Red flames erupted from all around Ash as he seared across toward the tiger. <BR> <BR>	Fury jumped toward the side just as Ash blazed past him.  Fury then unleashed a bright white lightning bolt from between his horns.  The bolt blasted past the dino as he spun around.  Fury began to unleash another when Ash leaped into the air and landed on Fury.  The now grounded tiger yelled as the large weight of the dino came down on his back. <BR> <BR>	“Good,” Hunter spoke, “ now, finish him off.”   <BR>	“No!” Wes yelled as he ran forward, drawing he’s sword and bringing it across.  It struck Ash across he’s face leaving a red line running across his nose. <BR> <BR>	“Jerk!” yelled Hunter, drawing his broad sword and charging toward Wes.  Hunter began to bring he’s sword down but Ash began to trash about enraged that the puny human could have hurt him to badly.  Ash whacked Wes down with his tail, and Hunter’s sword came down where Wes should be, but Ash’s tail is at now. <BR> <BR>	“Eh…” Hunter said in a puny voice, he looked over to see Ash just standing there with tears filling his eyes. <BR>	“I’m…eh…sorry?” Wes began, getting up.  Hunter got back into a normal standing stance turned toward Ash and said, <BR>	 <BR>	“I’ll take care of him.”  Ash just nodded with tears running down his face then grabbed the severed tailpiece and picked up the unconscious tiger and began walking away with him. <BR> <BR>	“Hey what are you doing?!” Wes yelled, as he steadied his sword. Hunter charged in thrusting his foot into Wes’ stomach.  Wes stepped back a couple feet trying to get spaced and regain some of his wind.  But Hunter was already on his feet bringing his sword down.  Wes brought up his sword to meet Hunter’s.  The swords were being pushed on each other, with Hunter having the upped hand.  Wes was forced into a lower stance, trying to gain leverage.  But it was no use, he was forced to the ground.   <BR>	 <BR>Hunter circled his blade causing Wes’ to fly off, now out of reach.  Hunter stood dominatingly over Wes, with his blade at Wes’ throat. <BR> <BR>Wes closed his eyes.  Wherever you are, mother and father, I hope you are happy.  If you are gone, then I’ll be seeing you, soon.  <BR>        <BR>-Nicholas D. Wolfwood-
