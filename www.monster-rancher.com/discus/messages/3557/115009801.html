 This is a rumor said by the Togle townspeople to their children....Long long ago...before people started breeding and raising monsters there was a hidden cavern located at the bottom of Kawrea.No one knew how to enter or get to it since it was guarded by 2 huge blood-thirsty Dragons.Only the monsters of the past knew about it....and whatever was beneath wasn&#39;t friendly.1 year later humans started to insert the monsters into Saucer Stones.They were almost done capturing all the monsters...all except the ones hidden at the Secret Kawrea Cavern.2 years later people still couldn&#39;t capture the monsters there because they knew the 75-year old magical Dragons were different from other Dragons and very powerful.So 1 boy dared to go there.He was 14.He made a plan.A plan which was...to sneak past the dragons during nighttime.So the boy went to Kawrea one dark evening.He sneaked past the dragons....and was saw something that made his spine freeze.He saw the rumor people were talking about,he saw the very powerful,the very dangerous.....the legendary Deathsaur&#40;Phoenix&#43;?&#41;.It had huge fangs inside his beak and it had a completely black body.It&#39;s body was surrounded by circle of fire.It had a long sleek tail.But worst of all....it had the power to kill people just by staring at them.When it saw the boy the boy was petrified...then he fell to the ground.....even now this rumor haunts the explorers who travel at Kawrea..because......sometimes they can see a black bird-like flying around 20 feet above them.....and sometimes if their really unlucky they can see a young playful boy playing and giggling near them................................
