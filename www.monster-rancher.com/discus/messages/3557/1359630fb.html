 In a land where monsters are constantly at war, a squad of rangers, called the Antlan rangers, defend what is truthful. Ant.Red, Ant.Blue, and Ant.Yellow, otherwise known as Solon,Soluv,and Zagref. These rangers have one leader in mind of capturing, a Joker named Mahjor, he is a demon joker. He is the first in a line of monsters that recieve the devil gene. The devil gene will give the monster carrying it an amazing amount of power. The rangers want this leader captured. These guys train under thaeir leader, a mysterious monster called Lot. Lot is said to be the most powerful monster that ever lived. The rangers have never seen Lot, neither have the other monsters in the land. One day, a mysterious Antlan comes by. He is a monster very rare. He is a Dark Antlan. But the rangers did not know this. His name is Hijora. He then joins the rangers. &#34;How are we going to capture HIM!!!&#34; Solon ask in rage. The rangers have tried to destroy Mahjor for years, but to no aveil. The land had turned red with blood and black with death over the years. The air was thick and poisonous. Many monsters were now extinct. The rangers were some of the last remaining Antlans in the land. Mahjor had taken over and seized much area. He was the most powerful monster in the land. Even the rangers were not powerful enough. But they were confident that Lot would help them. &#34;We have no choice, we must attack Mahjor&#39;s fortress.&#34; Zagref said. &#34;If we don&#39;t attack now, he&#39;ll get more powerful.&#34; The rangers had doubt in their faces. &#34;but if we attack we will surely be destroyed.&#34; said Solov. &#34;Dont have doubts Solov, we can defeat Mahjor with Lot&#39;s help.&#34; said Hijora. The rangers decided to attack in three days. They trained long and hard, but after three days they didn&#39;t think that they were ready.Solov said if they didn&#39;t attack now then he could expand his empire and have no aid to the rangers. When the rangers reached the fortress they were confronted with various guards, which ended in a blood bath. The air stank of dead bodies. The rangers were about to face a very powerful enemy and learn a very dark secret.  <BR> <BR>                   To be continued...

 Not that bad Sturnum. Mabeye you could check out mine. The Ancient World Chronicles: Tales of Good and Evil. Nobody&#39;s read it and I was waiting for comment to see if it sucked or not before I continued it.
