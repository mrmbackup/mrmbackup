<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>Kyle</B> on <B>Friday, October 13, 2000 - 08:59 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
Any comments, suggestions welcome.  <BR> <BR>Kyle Williams sat alone in his apartment. It was 3:30 in the morning. With a beer on the armrest of his chair, he sat with an old acoustic guitar on his lap, picking away at the first few bars from a certain Eric Clapton song called &#34;Tears in Heaven.&#34; <BR> <BR>   He sang to it silently, &#34;I must be strong, and carry on... &#39;cause I know, I don&#39;t belong... here in Heaven.&#34; <BR> <BR>   As he sat there thinking, a single tear ran down his cheek. It wasn&#39;t very often that he cried, but it was four years today that the massacre occured that ended the lives of so many close friends. His wife and children all killed in the fighting. It was the &#34;Great Wars.&#34;  <BR> <BR>   Four years ago, Shurikahn made a huge move to take control of the Earth, shattering both the Earth and the Black Moon in his strife. He attacked with such force that it took the very hearts and minds of Earth&#39;s greatest warriors to slow his onslaught, but it wasn&#39;t until the Gods and Goddesses of the land of Medeva interfered that Shurikahn was finally destroyed.  <BR> <BR>  Kyle had to bury nearly 30 people, all basically the only family he had. He had survived the battle, but it wasn&#39;t the injuries that scarred him, it was the pictures of his friends being killed while he could only watch. Kevin, Derek, Mike, Sydney, the Alin Kuei, and many monsters, all of them dead. <BR> <BR>   After those awful days, Kyle started becoming a pacifist. He wouldn&#39;t fight or train, even though he knew the intense fighting had made him incredibly more powerful than he could have ever imagined. The only reason he hadn&#39;t just commited suicide, was that he believed that it was the absolute most disgusting way for anyone&#39;s life to end. He had failed to die in battle with his comrades, so he would be forced to live in the shame of those memories for the rest of his life. <BR> <BR>   As he sat, he started falling asleep... <BR> <BR> <I><B>Kyle got up from his chair and started walking towards his room. As he neared the kitchen, he noticed a bright light behind him. He turned to see a familiar oval of energy floating in the air. It was a portal to another world.  <BR> <BR>  Seconds later he saw a figure dressed in a black robe, with a hood over their head so he couldn&#39;t see their face.  <BR> <BR>   &#34;Kyle Williams, you are the one who is cursed from the Great Wars, yes?&#34; It said. <BR> <BR>   &#34;Yes, I was the only one of the Earth Warriors to survive that conflict.&#34; <BR> <BR>   &#34;And you believe that turning into a pacifist will make this world better?&#34; <BR> <BR>   &#34;There is nothing left to fight for, there is no use anymore.&#34; <BR> <BR>   &#34;You are a coward. And you are stupid. There is so much you have forgotten. You are weak. Besides, there IS people in Medeva.&#34; <BR> <BR>  Kyle grit his teeth, &#34;Who are you?&#34; <BR> <BR>   &#34;Don&#39;t you remember you&#39;re own father?&#34; The figure revealed it&#39;s face, a cold skull. &#34;The one who died saving you...&#34;</B></I> <BR> <BR>  &#34;NO!!!&#34; Kyle woke up in a panicked sweat.  <BR> <BR>  He looked around finding himself still in the chair with his guitar on his lap. He shook his head.  <BR> <BR>  &#34;Of course, I could go back to Medeva. But how am I gonna get there.&#34; He sat quiet for a moment, deep in thought.  <BR> <BR>  He suddenly snapped his fingers. He got up setting his guitar back in it&#39;s case. He grabbed a leather jacket from a hook in his room, and a pair of black sunglasses. He was about to leave, when he went back, grabbing the guitar and strapping it around his back.  <BR> <BR>  He then went back into his room and took an ancient Japanese sword from a shelf.  <BR> <BR>   &#34;Can&#39;t forget you, baby.&#34; He said as he ran out the door...  <BR> <BR>  Moments later a sleek black motorcycle was on the streets, weaving through traffic at every opportunity. <BR> <BR>  It took 3 days of driving, but Kyle found the place he was looking for. A dark cave in the middle of no where. <BR> <BR>  As Kyle searched through the dimmly lit cave, he found a circular room, with many stone doors. <BR> <BR>  &#34;Alright! I just hope it hasn&#39;t been closed.&#34; He said as he got off his bike and approached one of the doors. He pressed a small stone in the wall, and the heavy door shuddered, then slowly moved to the side.  <BR> <BR>  It revealed a glowing blue portal.  <BR> <BR>  Kyle got back on his bike. &#34;I hope this still leads to Medeva.&#34; He laughed as he hit the gas and shot into it.

 I know it seems kinda weird, confusing, and senseless, but all will be explained within the story =&#41;. This prologue just leaves you wondering.
