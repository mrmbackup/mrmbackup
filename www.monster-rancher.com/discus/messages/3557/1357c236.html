The majestic creature stood beneath the waterfall. Slim and toned, you could barely see the rise and fall of his chest as he meditated and focused his energy. He opened his eyes suddenly. A growing sphere of energy started eminating fom him, pushing back the cascading water and the water in the bay. The gali mask tatoo on his chest started to glow, as he reached for his swords. His focus: a large boulder about 100 yards away.  <BR>   &#34;Wind Blade!&#34; <BR>   He whipped out both of the swords strapped to his sides and sliced an X through the air before him. An X made totally of wind energy, barely visible save for the shimmer it made, rushed forward and cut a clean X through the boulder. He then jumped off of the rock he was standing on and swam to the shore. Upon arriving, he shook himself off. He was a Cheetal, a cheetah monster. He had a tatoo of a Gali mask on his chest and wore a Gali&#39;s cape around his waist. Stapped to each side were two slender Feather Swords. Named so for their easy use and low weight, they were the weapon of choice for most Cheetals.  <BR>   &#34;Lorin!&#34;  <BR>   Lorin turned toward the source of the voice. It was Gorn, a young Cheetal not more than 13 years of age. Concern and terror were etched on his young face.  <BR>   &#34;Gorn! What&#39;s the matter?&#34;  <BR>   Gorn stopped running and tried to catch his breath.  <BR>   &#34;Moo&#39;s forces...city...come quick...danger...attacking...!&#34;  <BR>   Surprise and disbelief flashed across Lorin&#39;s face.  <BR>   &#34;WHAT?!&#34;  <BR>   Lorin set off on all fours, running at speeds in excess of 85 sectas per hour. Gorn&#39;s eyes widened.  <BR>   &#34;Wait for me!&#34;  <BR>   He said as he ran after the warrior.  <BR> <BR>&#42; &#42; &#42;  <BR> <BR>   10 minutes later, less than 1/6 of the time it took to get to the waterfall from the city, Lorin ran through the city gates. Members of his city were fighting Jokers that wore the crest of Moo himself. He saw one of his friends, Jorak, barely hanging on to life. A large pool of blood was forming under him, growing bigger ever so slowly. Lorin knelt beside his friend and held his head. The blood soaked intothe white cape around his waist. Jorak opened his eyes. His breathing was barely audible.  <BR>   &#34;Lorin...&#34;  <BR>   Lorin gave a small smile.  <BR>   &#34;What happened here? Pick a fight again, Jorak? Lorsha&#39;s not gonna be too happy about that..&#34;  <BR>   Jorak gave a smile in return.  <BR>   &#34;Lorsha...my dear wife...I&#39;m coming to see you soon...&#34;  <BR>   Jorak then breathed his last. Lorin stood, blood dripping from his waistcape.  <BR>   &#34;Rest well, old friend.&#34;  <BR>   He knelt down and closed his friend&#39;s eyes. Jorak then turned into a Lost Disk. He heard footsteps behind him. He turned to see Gorn, eyes wide open in terror.  <BR>   &#34;Lorin..is he...was it?&#34;  <BR>   Lorin pulled out each sword and turned to face Windspirit&#39;s Square, the heart of the city. The sounds of battle could be heard loudest from its direction.  <BR>   &#34;Yep. Jorak. He and many others as well have been lost to Moo&#39;s forces. Go to the mountains, Gorn. Hide in one of the many caves. When the sounds of battle fade away, go to Grayrock City. Go to the inn there and ask for Yugan. Tell him my name and what happened here. He will take care of you.&#34;  <BR>   Lorin turned and looked at Gorn. Gorn had tears streaming down his face.  <BR>   &#34;Okay. Be careful...&#34;  <BR>   He ran out of the city and headed toward the mountains. Lorin gave a loud battle cry and rushed toward the square. Along the way, he saw hundreds, maybe thousands of Lost Disks and buildings everywhere were on fire. He then saw the heart of the battle ahead of him. There were about 30 or so Jokers fighting amongst 20 Chitals. 5 of them wore the Gali crest on their chest and wore waistcapes of white. Many of them were bleeding profusely from wounds, but too stubborn to lay down their arms and die. Lorin was amazed.  <BR>   &#34;20 Chitals left? Out of THOUSANDS? God...&#34;  <BR>   He rushed behind a Joker and stabbed him through. Black blood coated his blade, and spilled onto the ground. The Joker then turned into a Lost Disk. A Cheetal turned to look at Lorin.  <BR>   &#34;Lorin! You&#39;re back!&#34;  <BR>   Lorin gave a smile.  <BR>   &#34;Kall! How&#39;s it going?&#34;  <BR>   Kall and Lorin each fought back against a Joker of their own.  <BR>   &#34;Pretty bad...Everyone&#39;s dead. They attacked by surprise. None of us were ready for it. We&#39;re the last...&#34;  <BR>   His sentence was cut short as a scythe flew and drove itself into his back. It could be seen exiting through his chest. He turned into a Lost Disk as the scythe flew back to its owner. Lorin took each sword and stabbed the Joker he was facing and the Joker Kall was fighting before his death through their hearts. He looked around. There were 4 or so Jokers left. He was alone. The last of a mighty Cheetal tribe. He pointed both swords out and started to concentrate. A bluish light eminated from each blade. The Jokers stepped back. As he continued to focus his energy, the swords grew brighter and brighter. He then spun in a circle.  <BR>   &#34;Wind Slice!&#34;  <BR>   A clear, shimmering circle burst out from him and sliced the remaining Jokers in half. Blood poured over the stony street as their top and bottom halves fell and turned into Lost Disks. He started to walk aimlessly through the streets of the city, still in shock of what has happened here today. A shooting pain coursed through his right arm.  <BR>   &#34;Aaaargh...&#34;  <BR>   He looked at his arm. A large gash issued out blood. He was surprised he never noticed it. A Joker must have sliced him. He sheathed each sword and sat at a bench. Lorin pulled out a roll of bandages from a pouch at his waist. As he nursed his wound, he started thinking to himself.    <BR>   &#34;A whole city. Laid to waste. Another to be added to Moo&#39;s horrible crimes. I must have revenge. He will not go unpunished.&#34;  <BR>   He tied up the bandage and started for the exit to the city.  <BR>   <I>&#34;And I will be your executioner Moo. The blood of my comrades cry out from the soil for revenge. Their cries will not be in vain, I swear it.&#34;</I>  <BR>   He exited he burning city, ready to hunt his prey.
