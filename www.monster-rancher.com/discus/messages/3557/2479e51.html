With a force and sound that shattered even the vacuum of space, the Odd Duck&#39;s hyperdrive exploded.  The impact of the wave of force that came from the now detonated lightspeed engine rocked the ship violently, knocking everyone to the floor, as none of those in the cockpit were wearing their seatbelts.  Chase recovered and quickly sat in his chair, fastening his seatbelt as he sat up.  Dan&#39;Tiree and Dion were slow in recovering to their seats, but followed suit as quickly as possible.  Chase glanced aside to his co-pilot and the jawa.  Neither of the smaller ones had been so lucky.  Bob had a serious gash in his chest, and was bleeding badly.  Yana had a similar wound in the side of her head as she lay on the floor of the ship.  The only consolation Chase had as he saw the first crewmates he&#39;d ever had laying on the floor of the ship was that at least his friends had not suffered long in their deaths. <BR>	       Forcing himself to suck it up, lest the rest of the survivors who now depended on his piloting skills die in an ensuing crash, Chase grabbed the controls and tried desperately to steer the ship from its deadly nose-first angle at what was now a fast-approaching planet  <BR>below as the intercom flared on. <BR>	       &#34;What happened?&#34;  It was the voice of the assassin droid, back in his own room. <BR>       	&#34;Hyperdrive detonated, Gramps.  Crash landing commencing.  How&#39;s everyone back there?&#34; <BR>       	&#34;Only myself and Lucky are functional.&#34; <BR>       	&#34;ALL the bunnies?&#34; <BR>       	&#34;Affirmative.&#34; <BR>       	&#34;Sh&#42;&#42;,&#34; Chase thought aloud, tears of sorrow choking his voice before he choked back the tears themselves, forcing himself to function. <BR>	       The smuggler pulled back hard on the control lever, trying desperately to even out the ship in its unstoppable descent.  Heat began to torture the ship&#39;s outer hull, as the Odd Duck had no engine power to slow itself down with, the engine having been decimated by the  <BR>hyperdrive explosion.  Chase gritted his teeth as what he was sure would be his last landing came nearer and nearer. <BR>       	In the brief instant he was able to make out the lay of some of the land on the planet the Odd Duck was rushing to meet, he noticed that the ship hurtled toward a mountainous island not far off the main land mass nearby.  Now, as he looked again, his distance from the surface  <BR>measureable in miles now, and his time left to land this ship safely measureable by seconds, he noted a volcano.  A volcano that the ship seemed to be dead set on diving into. <BR>       	Realizing that the only way to avoid landing fully in the lava crater was to actually shorten the dive, Chase pushed forward and left suddenly.  The quick jerk and wind resistance changed the ship&#39;s course just enough to keep it from completely falling into the lava as the Odd Duck  <BR>made it&#39;s final landing, crashing, miraculously, on the lip at the top of the volcanic crater. <BR>       	&#34;Everybody out, quickly!&#34; Chase ordered.  Everyone in the cockpit knew exactly what Chase was thinking.  They had no idea how long the ship would stay teetering on the crater.  Grabbing his heavy blaster pistol as he streaked by, Chase ran out the door of the cockpit, he heard a painful yell behind him.  Chase whirled to see Dion laying on the ground, injured. <BR>	       &#34;Go! I&#39;ll take care of him!&#34; Chase yelled at Dan&#39;Tiree.  She nodded and ran by, yelling at Gramps as she passed his room. <BR>       	&#34;What&#39;s wrong, Starfire?&#34; Chase asked quickly. <BR>	       &#34;Leg.  Broken.  Can&#39;t run.&#34; <BR>	       &#34;Then let me help you.&#34; <BR>       	The ship jerked suddenly and slid to a heavy angle.  Everyone still alive inside could feel the  <BR>ship moving downward toward the crater at an agonizingly slow rate. <BR>       	&#34;No!  I&#39;ll slow you down!&#34; <BR>       	&#34;BULL!&#34; <BR>       	&#34;I&#39;ll fight you every step of the way, Chase.  You can&#39;t save me. GO!&#34; <BR>       	&#34;But...&#34; <BR>       	&#34;Go, damn you!  You&#39;ve got someone else to worry about!  Take care of her!  I&#39;m done even if get out of here!  Run now!&#34; <BR>       	&#34;I&#39;m not going to let you suffer to death, Stormtrooper.&#34; <BR>	       &#34;Then end it so I don&#39;t have to.&#34; <BR>	       Chase looked into Dion&#39;s eyes.  Dion had resigned himself to die, but had enough determination in him that Chase knew he wasn&#39;t lying.  The Ex-Stormtrooper wouldn&#39;t let him help.  &#34;Damn his pride,&#34; Chase thought to himself. <BR>       	&#34;Do it, Chase, or run.  But do it NOW!&#34; <BR>	       The ship slid a bit suddenly, then appeared to be moving slightly faster. <BR>	       Chase looked down at Dion once more.  The hardened warrior had finally cracked, tears in his eyes, he whispered a desperate &#34;please...&#34; towards the smuggler.  Jericho leveled his blaster pistol at the Stormtrooper&#39;s head, turned his own because he couldn&#39;t watch, and  <BR>pulled the trigger as tears streamed down his face.  Another lurch by the ship brought Chase back to the urgency of the situation, and sent him running at full speed through the halls to the exit of his ship. <BR>	       Moments later, Chase staggered tiredly out of the ship, running several hundred feet into his fiancé&#39;s arms, tears on both their faces.  The droid watched them coldly for a moment, letting them have their time. <BR>	       &#34;Dion?&#34; Dan&#39;Tiree asked.  Chase only shook his head.  They embraced for a few seconds more until a loud, unpleasant grating sound split the blistering hot air around them. <BR>	       The Odd Duck, a battered and broken ship, slipped down from the place of its final landing  <BR>into the volcanic crater below, sizzling in the molten rock until it could be seen no more. <BR>	       Chase and Dan&#39;Tiree stared at it emptily.  Words would have only taken away from the meaning of the loss they had just suffered.  They continued to watch the wreckage boil beneath the surface for a moment before a cold robotic voice spoke from behind them. <BR>	       &#34;We have little time.  We should find shelter before something finds us.&#34; <BR>
