 Dadge, Moonshadow, and Galin all followed Roketh to the location of Vyger&#39;s death. It had been a seemingly endless flight there; perhaps the tension was getting to them. They didn&#39;t know how much time they had left, or what Kronock&#39;s next move would be, but every second that passed needed to be used. <BR> <BR>Moonshadow refused to fly with any of the three, but would meet them there. When Dadge said it was impossible for him to beat them there, Moonshadow made a sinister grin and shot off into the distance. They had lost sight of him for some time, but now they could see him again. He was there all right, sniffing around what was a large, rectangular hole. <BR> <BR>&#34;What the?!&#34;, Roketh wailed as he landed. The tombstones he had set up, smashed. Vyger&#39;s grave, unearthed, &#34;What sacrilegious demon would do this!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Here&#39;s your answer.&#34; Moonshadow spoke, slightly tossing his head to his left, &#34;He attacked the Elves, too.&#34; <BR> <BR>One Elf came out, obviously the only one brave enough to walk out from the forest. They had good reason to hide; many of their kind were now dead at the hands of a monster. <BR> <BR>&#34;Me name is Patterson.&#34; The Elf spoke with an Irish tongue. He was about up to Dadge&#39;s chest, but Dadge was no short man. He added after a slight pause, &#34;Nice to meet you.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Elf smiled, but was obviously terrified of them. He trembled and coughed when he started to lose his nerve, then he&#39;d start again. Eventually, he got out the whole story. About Kronock, about what he did and then what he said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Roketh, we can&#39;t let him get you.&#34; Dadge spoke softly through his helmet. <BR> <BR>Roketh walked towards were Vyger&#39;s headstone was. It was smashed into mostly pebbles now. Roketh&#39;s infamous scythe materialized into his left hand as he stared into the empty grave as he added, &#34;Then we have no time to waste.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, Roketh grabbed the weapon with both hands and raised it into the air. He plunged it into the ground in front of the grave. Everyone was terrified when the empty hole lit up orange as the way to the underworld was made clear. The ground quaked horribly. Dadge turned to ensure the Elf that everything was ok, but when he turned he barely caught a glimpse of his feet going into the brush. Finally, everything seemed to return to normal. The gang looked on in utter amazement. They were standing behind Roketh, and it was getting pretty late. They could see the outline of a large Dragon holding a massive scythe lazily in his right hand now. He was outlined by the eerie orange glow along with the red mist that flowed from the gap. Like the world now had a large wound on her, and it was bleeding with the mist and the distant screaming of the damned. <BR> <BR>&#34;My friends,&#34; Roketh said as he turned around, &#34;I appreciate everything you&#39;ve done for me. However, this last leg of our journey I must perform. If Kronock does show up let him follow me into the depths. I&#39;d rather face him in the underworld, than to meet any of you there.&#34; <BR> <BR>Everyone wanted to object but couldn&#39;t. Deep down, they knew they couldn&#39;t beat a demon like Kronock. They all merely hung their heads in utter silence. <BR> <BR>Roketh turned again to face the hollow grave in front of him. His first step was a shaky one, but the ones that followed were confident as he descended. They all merely watched his stroll into the open cavity and ultimately disappear in the glow and mist of the underworld. <BR> <BR>The next morning… <BR> <BR>Galin awoke a bit stupefied. The first place his gaze took him was to the entrance. No Roketh. He then looked around at all his awaking comrades. They had spent the night there and, aside from the gaping hole of death that illuminated nearly everything in an eerie orange glow of doom, it was a pleasant night. The stars shown brightly, almost symbolizing all their hope&#39;s combined to show a bright future, even in the heavens. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hmm…what have we here…?&#34; A strange voice thundered behind Galin. <BR> <BR>Galin jumped and spun into a fighting stance, only to come face to face with Kronock. <BR> <BR>&#34;Wake up!&#34; Galin screamed as he jumped backwards once again. <BR> <BR>&#34;Amusing.&#34;, Kronock said as they all got ready to fight, &#34;Hrmp. You&#39;re wasting my time. I have a dragon to absorb and a world to conquer.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge muttered to the others, &#34;Roketh didn&#39;t want us to do this, remember?&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin gritted his teeth at the thought of his weakness. When he lowered his arms, the others got out of their stances, too. <BR> <BR>&#34;Giving up? Good, now, whom should I execute first?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Roketh wanted to meet you, Kronock,&#34; Galin said slowly and pointed to the crevice, &#34;In there.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Ha. You think I&#39;d fall for that?&#34; Kronock laughed hysterically. <BR> <BR>&#34;Whatever, but that is a hole to the underworld.&#34; Moonshadow added slowly. <BR> <BR>Kronock gazed at the entrance. He shrugged and added, &#34;Well, whatever trap is set I&#39;m sure won&#39;t faze me. I&#39;ll go down there, right after your executions.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well,&#34; Dadge interceded, &#34;Every second you waste with us up here, Roketh has a better chance of finding Vyger down there.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kronock wasn&#39;t sure how much they were bluffing, or if they were. Yet, this was a chance he couldn&#39;t afford to take, not now. He began heading into the pit. As his second step was taken, he heard a loud scream behind him. <BR> <BR>&#34;NO!&#34; Galin screamed as he jumped on Kronock&#39;s back. Kronock grabbed him by his top two arms and threw him to his right. Galin hung on to Kronock&#39;s arm, however, and flipped him out of the hole. <BR> <BR>Both of them rose for another bout, but Dadge jumped in front of Galin, &#34;Are you nuts? Remember what Roketh said?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Dadge, there is a world at stake here. Roketh didn&#39;t want us to sacrifice ourselves because we are his friends. Well, it is times like this when our friends must be sacrificed. To not do so would be the most selfish thing imaginable. If I learned anything from Roketh, it is that my life is nothing to that of another. Roketh my not want us to fight, but we have to. Maybe not to win, but to delay. If Roketh is truly the one who can stop this fiend, then I&#39;ll gladly die buying him the time he needs.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge looked a little dumbfounded. His answer was quite simple with the sound of his weaponry and his lightsaber powering up. <BR> <BR>Moonshadow also came and stood by him. As he did, he said, &#34;I hate you when your right, you moron.&#34; <BR> <BR>Meanwhile…In the underworld… <BR> <BR>Roketh had fought his way through more demons and devils than he&#39;d care to count. He had just rounded another curve when he bumped into another one. He reared back and was about to strike down the unknown thing when he heard a familiar voice say his name, &#34;Roketh? Oh no, they got you too…&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh looked down and dropped his jaw in shock, &#34;Jace?&#34; <BR> <BR>The transparent form of his lost friend stood there. His body was badly burned all over, how it was when he died. Tears filled his eyes as he asked, &#34;What now? If the brothers killed you, then who can stop Kingston now?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh my friend, much has happened. I&#39;ll tell you on the way, if you can lead me somewhere.&#34; <BR> <BR>Jace looked up at the big Dragon before asking, &#34;Where to?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Vyger.&#34; <BR> <BR>Jace made a rather uncomfortable looking grimace as he said, &#34;Ok, but your not gonna like it.&#34; <BR> <BR>20 minutes later… <BR> <BR>Roketh had filled his old comrade in to the last detail. Now, they stood in front of a large, metal door. <BR> <BR>&#34;Vyger is in there. He has been made to fight the toughest demon down here for eternity. That demon never eats, sleeps, or gets tired. His name is Bethemos. I can&#39;t help you now, you are on your own. I&#39;m sorry.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, Jace&#39;s spirit faded into nothing, leaving Roketh in front of a large, solid door. He could hear some loud grunts from inside the room, followed by some moaning of a familiar voice. It sounded like a war. The grunting sounded like a rather large and unruly beast. <BR> <BR>&#34;Vyger…I&#39;m coming…&#34; <BR> <BR>-What kind of monsters is Vyger locked in eternal combat with? Will Roketh&#39;s added strength be enough? Find out next time.- <BR> <BR>CHB
