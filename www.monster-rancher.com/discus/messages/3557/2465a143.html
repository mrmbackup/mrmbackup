 Chapter 21:No turning back... <BR> <BR>It was a beautiful sight, this island. The waves crashing against the rocky beach, slowly weathering the stone as it had done for centuries. Seagulls cried out in the distance always looking for a meal. Of course, there was the sunset, perhaps the most brilliant and awe inspiring to grace the skies in countless ages. The horizon shone brightly with reds, oranges and golds melded together in such a way that few could find themselves able to not gaze upon it, at least for a moment. The type of beauty an artist would strive their entire life to create and fail in the end. How fitting, that this may be the last sunset the free world would ever see. Perhaps it marked the end of an era, the beginning of something new? Maybe it was just another sunset... <BR> <BR>Then, as though awakened from a dream the peace and tranquillity of the beach was harshly disturbed as monsters in small boats came ashore. The area was far to treacherous for the larger ships and so the small army used these smaller craft to make the transition. Roughly 3 thousand monsters clambered onto shore, of nearly every conceivable type, nearly half of which served the evil Moo. But now old hatreds were shoved aside, the monsters stood united both in their determination to stop this threat to there world and in the knowledge that they probably would not return alive... <BR> <BR>As the forces assembled on the beach a final boat came ashore and from it stepped a durahan. Justice set his gaze forward, steeling himself for the task ahead as Moo himself descended from the sky to land beside him. The plan was simple, the Master had built a powerful defense perimeter that could stop any large force from assaulting his tower. Justice intended to infiltrate with a small group and attack the Master himself, the root of this evil. In order to do so his army would have to keep the defense systems busy and that, in essence, was suicide... <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you ready my friend?&#34;Justice asked the zuum nearby. <BR> <BR>&#34;Of course...we all are sir.&#34;Begras shifted his gaze to the other monsters. <BR> <BR>&#34;Then lets do it. For our homes, our trainers, for all the lives taken before their time.&#34;Justice drew his sword and raised it high for all to see before pointing it at the massive black tower in the distance. &#34;It is time the master faced Justice!!&#34; <BR> <BR>With those words a thousand battle cries rang out and the monsters charged forth. They had not gotten twenty feet from the beach before the defense systems became active. The legions of airborne abominations that circled in the distance flew towards them with all the speed their sleek bodies allowed. Still the army charged onward. Upon reaching fifty feet from the beach Defense turrets rose from the ground and began firing. They stood in clusters of three and were fairly close together. This was indeed a suicide mission... <BR> <BR>Justice let his sword fall upon the skull of a minion as it swooped down to attack, severing it&#39;s head. As the body crashed limp to the ground he scanned the area for his strike team. All he saw was carnage, a massacre upon a massacre, they would not be able to hold out much longer...He spotted Stone claw first and then Shielka who was right behind him. The warrior struck down another minion as he called out to them. &#34;Where are the others? Have you seen them?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No! You should have rounded us up BEFORE you gave your little speach!&#34;Stone claw hissed as he hurled energy shots into the sky. They struck a cluster of minions, raining chunks of flesh and inards onto the battlefield.&#34;In a mission where not a single mistake can be allowed you already made one old man!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I can&#39;t think of everything! Now shut up and find them!&#34;Justice yelled back at him, that same thought echoing through his mind. He was getting too old for this crap...Fortunately a few seconds later Ganthor, Celine and Beatdown joined the ranks. But perhaps the most important member of this team was now missing...Moo. &#34;Where is he? Just what I...Take cover!&#34; <BR> <BR>A massive barrage of energy blast sailed their way, forcing the monsters to take cover behind one of the numerous stone outcroppings that littered this battlefield. Ganthor curled up into a ball but was still to large for the stone to cover and was grazed by one of the blasts. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ow! Man, that hurt!&#34;He yelled, meanwhile little Beatdown simply shook her head and muttered &#39;Wuss&#39;. Justice looked up, his mind racing. They were pinned for the moment. Then a great shadow passed over the battlefield as Moo flew overhead. With a single devastating blast of fiery hell he reduced the Tri-Turrets attacking them to nothing more then melted metal and burnt wires. This was the opening they needed as every turret in the area began to target Moo solely, giving Justice and his team time enough to make it through the perimeter. At the same time his army was able concentrate on the airal threat as Moo destroyed the Turrets three by three...Then something unthinkable happened. The smashed Autoguns were pulled back into the ground, only to be replaced by twice the number... <BR> <BR>By this time the strike team were well passed the defensive line. Justice didn&#39;t want to abandon them, but they had no choice, there was no turning back. Celine lit up the darkening sky with a megaray, a signal that they had successfully past the Masters perimeter of defense. Hopefully what few monsters lucky enough to survive that onslaught would make it safely back to the ship. Justice prayed for their safety as they ran on, the black tower getting closer by the minute. Every step closer to it brought about a profound sense of dread... <BR> <BR>Time passed, nearly a half an hour later the group staggered into a deserted town. It was clear that this place had been visited by the master...Dried bloodstains dotted the cobblestone paths. The houses, built from brick were blackened and charred in places, as if someone had tried to set them on fire. Two shops had been totally decimated by powerful explosions. Lastly, as the group entered the square the found a human corpse rotting atop a waterfountain. It had been there for sometime, the skin looked slimy and waterlogged, as if it would peel off if touched. Shielka stepped forward, starring at the body and shook her head. The light from the setting sun set her hair ablaze. Standing there she looked tall, proud and fierce, as was her dragon heritage. <BR> <BR>&#34;This was Vor&#39;s doing, senseless...&#34;She said. Justice was slightly alarmed at the tone of her voice. It sounded as if the daina was more annoyed by the nature of Vor&#39;s action then anything else. He sensed no remorse whatsoever for the poor human who&#39;s life was brutally taken away. Unfortunately he didn&#39;t have time to question this monsters motives, besides, if he&#39;d risk teaming with the evil of Moo he could take a chance with Shielka and assume her trustworthy. Then, as if summoned by the mere thought, Moo descended into the center of town. His fur was slightly scorched in places but otherwise he was just fine... <BR> <BR>&#34;So much for the, ehem, unbreachable defense. That was too easy.&#34;Moo said with more then a hint of annoyance in his voice. Clearly he expected more. &#34;Now all that remains is to crush this &#39;Master&#39; with my own talons...Come!&#34; <BR> <BR>Before Justice or any of the others could take a single step the earth began to tremble and then shake violently. A large crack split the ground under the fountain as something huge and black began to rise...Slowly, deliberately clawing it&#39;s way into the surface. The desecrated fountain was turned aside by the horn of a jaggernaut. Next it&#39;s crimson eyes could be seen, then the impenetrable ebon shell of it&#39;s massive body. At last it had emerged, and all stood in awe and terror at a creature that seemed far more intimidating then even moo, towering over the evil one himself...  <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Darklon,&#34;It said in a voice that seemed to cause the very ground to tremble...&#34;You will not pass.&#34; He did not attack, but merely stood there, blocking the way. Justice realized they were running out of time. This enemy would have to be defeated, and quickly.  <BR> <BR>&#34;The Hell we won&#39;t!&#34;Stone claw prepared to lunge fearlessly at the jaggernaut but Shielka grabbed his arm. <BR> <BR>&#34;Wait! You&#39;ll have no chance against him alone.&#34;She pleaded,&#34;Don&#39;t rush in foolishly, we have to fight together.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I concurr,&#34;Justice pointed his sword at the beast. &#34;Everyone, Attack!&#34; With those words the group of monsters sprung forward to confront this threat. Ganthor took the lead, a look of steely determination in his eyes. Unfortunately Darklon merely lowered his head and flipped the strongehorn over it&#39;s back. A second later Celine and Shielka took to the air, circling Darklon, bombarding him with megarays and flame attacks, all were utterly ineffective. Justice led beatdown and Stoneclaw to pummel it&#39;s armored carapace... <BR> <BR>For a few short moments Darklon merely ignored his pesky enemies, their attacks meant nothing to him. But as harmless as they were he had orders to destroy any who threatened his Master. Suddenly the jaggernaut emitted a wave of black energy from it&#39;s body that sent everyone flying backward several feet. Justice struck the ground hard, as did everyone else. As he wondered what could pierce that shell Moo flew overhead, having held back until this moment.  <BR> <BR>He assaulted Darklon with a airal combination of claw attacks, each mighty blow send the jaggernaut reeling, but none did real harm. Darklon retaliated was a single thrust from his ebon horn. It was a well timed attack, slicing moo across the chest in the same place as before, causing the dragon to roar in anguish. Seeing this moment of weakness the beast took to the air, attacking first with a punch to moo&#39;s face. Moo blocked the strike and swiftly returned the favor. He lunged forward, slamming his knee into the beetles armored midsection. The two juggernauts continued to trade blows as the others watched helplessly from below. The dragon was holding his own, but still was unable to do any real damage, darklon just kept coming... <BR> <BR>&#34;Times running out...&#34;Justice said, turning to Shielka. &#34;Doesn&#39;t that guy have any weaknesses?&#34; The daina merely shook her head.&#34;In that case, you and Celine fly up and aid Moo.&#34; <BR> <BR>The two complied, flying quickly to confront Darklon alongside Moo. Darklon let loose a low, frightening laugh as a black sphere formed at the tip of his horn...Three shadow beams shot from his horn, all were avoided but it was merely a diversion. Without warning the jaggernaut sped forward, effortless striking both pixie types from the air. Moo attacked with both fists but Darklon caught them in mid swing. Moo unleashed a surge of fire from his mouth but the flame was ineffective. Darklon laughed once again before proceeding to hammer his horn against Moo&#39;s skull. He then hurled the dragons body to the ground... <BR> <BR>Moo&#39;s body crashed back to earth leaving a rather large crater. They waited a few seconds but Moo didn&#39;t emerge as Darklon flew back down to finish them off. The emblem on Darklon&#39;s chest began to glow with an Erie light. At that moment shadows began to appear, frightening shades that moved with a will of their own. The masters warrior summoned dozens of these minions and more came still, oozing from cracks and crevices, from dark alleys and corners...Justice was now pretty much at a loss, but he still had one last trick to employ though a risky one.  <BR> <BR>At Darklon&#39;s command the shadows sprang forward and so did justice and his team. As they distracted the dark minions justice weaved a path through the melee charging the jaggernaut directly. Darklon wasn&#39;t very concerned, lifting a hand and sending a wave of dark energy erupting from the earth. Justice avoided the blast and the next, his sword glowing as he poured his own life force into the blade. At last he was within striking distance and took three smooth strokes to the enemies midsection, each blow seeping with the power of his soul. Upon the last strike a small explosion ripped off a chunk of Darklon&#39;s armor, revealing vulnerable muscle tissue. Enraged the monster grabbed justice, preparing to crush him like a tin can... <BR> <BR>But death did not come for the warrior just yet as a truly terrifying roar echoed across the ruined square, filling the night sky. Even the shadowy minions stopped attacking at the sound which came from the nearby crater. Then he emerged, the dragon Moo, his wings spread to their fullest, his eyes practically seeping anger and hatred. Darklon dropped justice and charged the dragon. Moo simply sidestepped the attack, grabbing the jaggernaut by it&#39;s horn. With one powerful motion he tore it from his opponents head and rammed it into the flesh justice had exposed. But even then Darklon would not die, attacking with a fist. Moo caught the punch in mid swing and quickly twisted his arm in a direction it was never meant to bend. Yet even as his arm snapped Darklon&#39;s other claw clashed the symbol around his neck... &#34;Master attack...Dark Judgment!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What!?&#34;Moo snarled, he&#39;d seen this happen before and remembered when Jakira nearly killed him because of it. Meanwhile shielka fled towards the dark tower. <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t just stand there, run!!&#34;The daina cried back to them as beams of light began to pierce Darklon&#39;s battered form. Justice and the others ran for their lives as a huge pillar of black flame engulfed the jaggernaut and then quickly began to spread outward to devour the entire town. Homes and buildings were vaporized instantly as the monsters remained only a few steps away from death. Finally the pillar stopped growing and the monsters looked back to see nothing but a charred patch of land...Justice fell to his knees, drained from the earlier attack. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah man, we&#39;re still alive!&#34;Ganthor said happily,&#34;I nearly got fired back there...but we won.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Not that you helped any...&#34;Celine responded, rubbing a sore arm.&#34;Why did we bring you along anyway?&#34;Ganthor looked a bit hurt by her comment. <BR> <BR>&#34;Enough!&#34;Moo roared, wiping the blood from his mouth...A weapon could be seen atop the dark tower now, energy surging within under the starless sky...&#34;We&#39;ve wasted far too much time here...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;For once we agreed Moo,&#34;Justice said.&#34;It looks like they are almost ready to fire. We must end this once and for all...No turning back now.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, far from the point of conflict the mysterious Zyoth watched and waited to see the outcome. If these monsters won, fine, they would leave. If they failed or took too long the zyoth would obliterate this world. Their leader Raa-zor and his second Ciera watched on. The female seemed restless and began pacing back and forth... <BR> <BR>&#34;Will you calm down,&#34;Raa-zor said.&#34;Have patience...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I just don&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t Y&#39;kal blow this place up...&#34;Ciera said as she continued to pace. &#34;Che&#39;hoc zy Gi&#39;toh....&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Watch your laugage.&#34;Raa-zor commanded.&#34;Don&#39;t forget who&#39;s in charge here. I will give them a chance, they deserve that much.&#34;He then walks away, leaving Ciera alone... <BR> <BR>&#34;Their just animals...&#34;She sneered,&#34;They&#39;re not worth saving...your a fool Raa-zor. One day I&#39;ll be running things...you&#39;ll see. Then we do it my way.&#34;
