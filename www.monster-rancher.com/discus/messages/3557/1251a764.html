 Chapter 11:Showdown in Torlormec  <BR> <BR>&#34;It was here...&#34;  <BR> <BR>Eight cloaked figures strode across the wasteland of fire and brimstone, passed a river of molten rock. Human shaped, their features were masked by dark hoods which were crimson, like the lava flowing around them. Only their hands could be seen, clawed fingers grasping blinking electronical devices. The foremost of the group led the others toward what once was a volcano. It looked like something had errupted from within, something huge. Entering the broken and jagged crags, they desended into the steaming earth. The darkness and heat of this place was a welcome surprize to these beings, it felt like home.  <BR> <BR>Flashing scanners led them through the thick blackness to a shadowy corner. There, they found that which they were seeking. A large oval shaped machine, clearly designed to hold something, lay in the shadows. It&#39;s metal was twisted and mangled during the escape of it&#39;s contents. The leader of the party bowed his head thoughtfully while the others awaited his decision. But their youngest, overcome with curiousity, approached the wreckage for a closer look. A symbol, still readable, was engraved into the side. It was the symbol of an eye.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Zykoror!&#34;He gasped.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Get away from it Nerao,&#34;The leader spoke.&#34;This is what we feared. It has escaped and is loosed upon this world. In case of such an event the councils orders are clear...it must be destroyed, at all cost.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes,&#34;Said his second in command, Seira&#34;But the pod has been offline for a very long time. Surely zykoror has already taken this world, the same as it did during the time of our ancient ancestors. It will be nigh impossible to stop it now.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;She&#39;s wrong,&#34;Said a third called Neyos.&#34;Look around you, the damage to this place is recent or my scanner lies. We still have time, though I wonder how it was able to survive...Where would a host be found in a place like this?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;That does not matter,&#34;Seira said&#34;Zykoror is too dangerous to toy with. I suggest we go back home and get the weapon we need to blow this place to atoms...or we could use our own powers. Only then can we be sure of our enemies defeat. Besides, the council wills us to use any force required. To ensure the safty of our world, this one is expendible.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;I will consider your requests as a last resort only,&#34;The leader stated.&#34; There must be anouther way besides genocide. We must-&#34;Suddenly his scanner began to beep madly. &#34;I&#39;ve got a reading on our quarries location. Let us hope we don&#39;t have to obliterate this world to accomplish our mission...&#34;  <BR> <BR> <BR>The long rain had finally ceased, the grey clouds parted, pierced by the first rays of sunlight. Having long cleared the valley in which they had fought, the small army of monsters continued on, slowly yet determined still. Time wore on however, a day passed and then yet anouther. On the third day, after many hours of marching their steps slackened, their heads hung low. An ever growing sense of dread fell upon them. Justice tried to encourage them, urged them onward, but in the end it did little as he himself still had no idea of how to thwart the dark raven and the Master within.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Sir,&#34;Begras ran up to Justice. The zuum looked most troubled.&#34;The others are becoming restless. Moral is real low, many are considering leaving you.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Just what I need.&#34;The durahan said, tapping his sword along his shoulder.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Can you blame them sir?&#34;Begras added&#34;This isn&#39;t exactly what we signed on for. The only reason most of us have not left is because of our respect for you, and the dim hope that you have a plan. Not everyone feels this way however...and thats not our only problem, we&#39;re nearly out of food. As for that I already have a suggestion. I believe theres a city ahead, Torlormec it&#39;s called, we can stop there.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Justice nodded in agreement and hoped his legions would hold together just alittle longer. They had to deviate from the path to reach their new destination, but there was no choice; the search for the master would have to wait until they&#39;d resupplied. Luck seemed to be with them for a change as the city was closer then was thought. Torlormec came into view, most visible of all was the massive colloseum in which the entire city was built around. It reminded the durahan of Windoa only much larger, over twice the size. But even from a distance something seemed amiss.  <BR> <BR>There seemed to be very little movement inside the city. Coming closer still justice could see what looked like defensive barriers being erected. Suddenly a bell began to ring wildly from within the cities walls, some kind of alarm. Hundreds of monsters poured onto the streets and gathered behind the gates, taking up fighting positions. Realizing that his army was being viewed as a threat, justice called begras and once again asked for a lift. The two then headed for Torlormec, a group of centuars meeting them halfway.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Who are you? State your business!&#34;The centuar demanded, pointing is spear at the durahans armored chest. He wore a badge of status that recodnized him as a captain of the IMA forces. Justice recounted the events of the last several days. The arrival of the dark raven and it&#39;s brutal assualt and the battle in moo&#39;s valley base. The centuar nodded.&#34;Yes, we too have seen this raven. It flew very close to our city but left us in piece. I have no idea why it did not attack but we won&#39;t be taking any chances. Your forces may enter, so long as you swear to aid in Torlormec&#39;s defence should we be attacked during your stay.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Justice agreed and, after sending begras back to the army with the news, began to explore the city. Most of the humans were inside their homes. Children peered out of windows along with the more noisy adults. IMA troops patroled every stone road, stood on every corner. They were mostly monsters but some human soldiers as well, and of course a few well dressed representitives of the committee. Justice passing by the cryo freezers, which were closed along with everything else. He stopped, looking through the window he saw rows upon rows of frozen monsters and coud&#39;nt help wondering if ever he would share such a fate. The durahan would much rather die in battle then exist forever in such a state.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey!&#34;A loud voice said from behind. Justice turned around and saw a huge Stronghorn standing right behind him. It was a mix of golem and beaclon, an uncommon monster to say the least. The stronghorn poked justice with his finger.&#34;I know you! Justice right? Remember me? We fought in the A class a few years back!&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Um...&#34;Said Justice, searching his vast memory for a name to match this face.&#34;Ganthor?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah! Thats right!&#34;Ganthor patted justice on the back, the force of which sent the durahan crashing to the ground.&#34;Oh, sorry bout that.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;N-no problem,&#34;Justice said as the stronghorn helped him up.&#34;What are you doing here anyway?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Came with my trainer to get some dough!&#34;Ganthor explained.&#34;Then, before I knew it, Bam! They declare martial law! We&#39;re stuck here until the crisis blows over. But what about you? I had heard you&#39;d retired. Then I here you were second in command to general Loveless, now you show up here with all those guys followin! An I thought retirement was boring...Hey, did I tell ya what happened to Ordorf?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Not now,&#34;Justice said.&#34;I have some bussiness to take care of. We&#39;ll talk later if you want.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok, I&#39;ve got an appointment anyway.&#34;Ganthor said&#34;Some weird pixie type. I don&#39;t know what she was, but she promised to buy me a drink, how can I pass that up!&#34; Justice watched the stronghorn thunder down the road to a nearby bar. He was able to squeeze himself in, after doing a large amount of structural damage. Minutes later Celine came flying toward him, she looked quite aggitated.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Justice! I saw her!&#34;The dryad stopped to catch her breath.&#34;That Lilim I fought with! She took the back way into that bar over there. If she&#39;s here your enemies may be as well. We can both get revenge!&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m glad you told me first instead of rushing in, let us-&#34;He stoped, hearing someone scream in the distance.They looked up and watched as the Dark Raven desended from the clouds and cast it&#39;s shadow upon the city. IMA armies rallied with justice&#39;s forces alongside them, panic spread throughout. The raven hovered over them, it&#39;s black metal body seemed to absorb light itself. It made no effort to attack, for now it waited...  <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I told you already!&#34;Ganthor screamed at the lilim. They were in the bar, not far from where Justice stood.&#34;I&#39;m not joining your crazy little organization! Count me out!&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Did I say you had a choice?&#34;Jakira smiled&#34;But if you keep pushing me i&#39;ll be forced to kill you...I haven&#39;t done that in awhile, nearly three hours. Please, force me to kill you.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Your nuts!&#34;The stronghorn turned his back on her. Big mistake. Jakira unleashed a bolt of enegy that knocked Ganthor flat on his face. Never had he been struck down so easily. The enraged golem pulled himself up only to become face to face with a large Crab dragon.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Allow me to introduce my comrade,&#34;Jakira said&#34;His names Grapper. Say hello grapper.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Grapper grabed the Stronghorn and hurled his massive form through a wall. Ganthor crashed through a brick wall and landed painfully on the street, sliding a few feet before coming to a halt. At this time strange flying creatures were unleashed against the IMA from within the raven, filling the sky like a swarm of locusts, but ganthor had his own problems. Jakira hovered over him and summoned a ball of rolling energy in her outstretch palm. Ganthor gasped, stareing into the soft glow of his own demise. Suddenly a lightening bolt struck Jakira&#39;s hand with deadly accuracy, the energy ball exploded sending the lilim carreening into a wall.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Jakira! Ready for round two?&#34;Said Celine, justice beside her. Grapper burst out of the bar to aid Jakira, standing between the lilim and they&#39;re three enemies.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Hold on Grapper,&#34;Jakira said taking notice of the IMA troops that were filling the streets.&#34;This battle is better fought elsewhere.&#34; <BR> <BR>With those words black flame surged forth from the ground, surrounding all the combatants. A moment later the flame subsided and Justice found himself no longer in the street, but standing in the coliseum. Ganthor and Celine stood nearby, confused as to what had just occured. Then Grapper appeared, no more the six feet away, the huge crab dragon meeting the stronghorn eye to eye. Jakira materialized on the balconey seat overlooking the arena, a seat normally resevered for certin members of the IMA commitee.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Let the games begin!&#34;She shouted&#34;Grapper, kill them. Oh, and make sure there&#39;s blood, lots of blood!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You have enraged us,&#34;Grapper said, putting his clawed hand to his crest, the eye began to glow red.&#34;You must die! Master attack....Demon Guard!&#34;At first no change could be noticed, then Ganthor charged in to deliver an uppercut. His fist was turned aside by an unseen force. Justice attacked with a slash combo, each strike bouncing off an invisible barrier. Lastly Celine attacked with flame, the shearing heat revealed the protecting shield, causing it to flicker but not die. Grapper only laughed at his enemies futile attempts to harm him and attacked himself, breathing fire at them.  <BR> <BR>They dodged, Justice and Celine attacked once again but their power was deflected. It seemed that know attack whatsoever would penatrate the guard. Ganthor and the crab dragon were now going back and forth. Ganthor&#39;s blows bounced off the barrier and yet Grappers felt no resistence. How could that be...unless the shield went down to let his attacks through. Justice charged and the dragon reacted with his flame. This was in fact what the durahan wanted. <BR> <BR>Justice acted quickly, rolling under the flames and slashed the monster in the chest. Injured, his guard dropped for a moment, grapper staggered back while Ganthor lowered his head and charged. The stronghorn, true to his namesake, impaled the crab dragon and lifted him into the air. Then, grabing his arms and legs, ganthor ripped his enemy in half like a broiled lobster.  <BR> <BR>&#34;What? Thats it?&#34;Jakira said, feeling no loss over grappers death.&#34;Oh well, at least I get seafood for lunch.&#34;She laughed and summoned an entire legion of winged minions at her flank. A larger one, much like the one justice had killed in the valley, flew near her.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve really crossed the line this time durahan!&#34;She screamed &#34;No one slays one of the Masters warriors and lives! Overseer, kill them!&#34; She retreated, leaving them to her minions, the larger overseer eyed them coldly.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Oblivion!&#34;A voice cried, and the overseer was hit with some form of energy. It began to shake and convulse violently, if the beast had a mouth it would most certinly scream. Then it began to implode, as if being painfully devoured from the inside. In a moment it was gone and the smaller minions began to retreat, unable to function without their leader. Justice looked toward the source of the attack and saw a tall figure in a long, crimson cloak.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Who are you?&#34;The Durahan asked. The stranger said nothing, lifting his clawed hand to reveal pulsing black energy building in his palm. Justice raised his shield, anticipating an attack. The black orb was thrown, but not at justice. Instead it was hurled upward, into the cloud of the Masters minions. Once in the middle of them the cloaked one closed his fist, the orb exploded in a cloud of ebony dust that lingered in the sky. Hundreds of dead minions rained onto Torlormec and the dark raven itself retreated into the clouds, lifting it&#39;s great shadow from the city and from the hearts of thoughs who dispaired at it&#39;s coming.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter 12:Dark side <BR>	 <BR>It was a beautiful explosion, powerful, brillant, engulfing Moo&#39;s training base. Then it disappeared, as do most things of beauty, leaving death and carnage in it&#39;s wake. There had been no time for the poor monsters to act, no chance of escape. Like the symbol of death it was, the raven parted the clouds and desimated all that stood before it. Now there was only ruin, nothing had survived the blast, no tower left standing. In his black chamber, shrouded in perpetual darkness, the Master watched and gloated over this victory. The first test of the ravens power was a complete success. <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, Talus was feeling quite pleased with himself, stareing at the nearby vid screen. He was full of himself for the moment, and with good reason. It was he who built the weapon, with nothing to go on but an ancient blueprint and spare parts. It was Talus who repaired the massive ship by himself. Now, looking at the huge crater left by the ravens cry he was overjoyed. That massive power was his doing, as if seeing all those lives wiped out in true overkill made his long, hard years all worth it. But even he didn&#39;t expect it to be so damaging. Shielka looked over his granite encrusted shoulder, almost in shock at what she had witnessed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Talus,&#34;She said in a strange, slightly nervous tone.&#34;I think you set the thing up to high...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No, it is correct.&#34;Talus said smugly&#34;You&#39;ve just seen the ravens cry on it&#39;s lowest setting.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That was it&#39;s weakest!?&#34;Shielka gasped&#34;What could this thing do on full power?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you kidding?&#34;The Gaia laughed&#34;At it&#39;s max capablity, the blast would destroy....&#34;&#40;Some grinding sounds came from his processor&#41;&#34;35% of the continent. Of course, there would be a major power drain so we&#39;d have to convert to stationary mode.&#34; <BR> <BR>Shielka opened her mouth to speak but just then the voice of the master was heard.&#34;Attention, my second in command is to report to me immediately! Talus, IMA forces approach, show them my power as well.&#34; Shielka left quickly leaving talus to his job. The Gaia looked at the vidscreen and saw an army of monsters. They were scattering, a few escaping into the nearby swamp, but there is no escaping the masters will. Talus punched in the commands and the raven fired into the center of the fleeing army. The explosion that followed was as glorious as the last, hurling bodies far and wide.  <BR> <BR>The dust settled and Talus went to work on his masters plan. Settling over the field of dead, the raven began to gather up the butchered corpses. As fresh meat filled the storage bay, Talus brought up an image on his screen. It showed an unusal creature, short and muscluar with long talons and some henger like components. The Master himself had designed it and it&#39;s capabilities were truely frightening. The monster could render itself invisible making it an excellent stealth unit. Hammering in more commands, working with speed only a machine could manage, he activated the monster generator. The ancient device strained as it did it&#39;s job despite the repairs but it did work. After a few minutes a disc stone was produced and fell onto a conveyerbelt. The belt carried it to a mechcanical arm which placed the disc onto yet anouther device. A moment later the monster was released from it&#39;s temporary prision. It stood before talus, egarly to awaiting instruction. <BR> <BR>&#34;Alright prototype 001,&#34;Talus said&#34;Lets see if you can be of use. Your first mission will be to hunt down and kill our enemies who have escaped into the swamp.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Affirmitive.&#34;It said in a mechanical voice. The thing displayed no hint of emotion and lacked any will of it&#39;s own. It&#39;s only purpose to serve the Master, it was incapable of disobeying him. <BR> <BR> <BR>Shielka flew with all the speed her wings allowed her. It had been three days since the testing of the raven. Three days since that horrible power was first unleashed upon the world. She had been summoned by the master that day and given a new mission, one the daina didn&#39;t particularly care for. She was to proceed to an island that was vital to the masters plan and ensure that her three comrades, Vor, Darklon and Flood had accomplished their task of wiping out the human settlements. Shielka had no love for humans, but Vor&#39;s methods were often too cruel to stomach. At least it would be a short mission, after all, they were three of the masters more loyal followers. <BR> <BR>Finally, the first town came into view. It was still burning, which meant she might find them nearby. The daina landed in the center of town, fires raged all around her but were slowly dieing out. They didn&#39;t have much to burn since nearly every house was made from brick and stone, how stupid Vor was at times. Dead bodies littered the streets like pieces of discarded trash. There deaths had been painful ones. Close by was a fountain, perhaps it had been beautiful once, before a human had been impaled on top so that the waters came out red and bloody. Shielka stared at it for a moment before turning away in disgust. <BR> <BR>&#34;Vor, you sick....&#34;Her voice trailed off. Why was she berating her fellow warrior? Why did she feel sorry for these humans, after all they&#39;ed done to her, to her mother, to all monsters. The daina shook the feelings from her skull, this was not the time to grow soft, not when victory was so close. With the power of the raven it was only a matter of time before humanity surrendered, then they would be enslaved. Remembering her mothers fate she felt her anger and hatred anew, for a moment at least. Then she heard the cries. <BR> <BR>Someone was alive and weeping in the dead town. Shielka scouted the area and found the source soon enough. It was a human girl, no more then three or four years old, crying over an unmoving body. At first, Shielka only felt her new for vengence and gladly recalled her Masters orders&#34;Wiped out human infestation, leave no one alive.&#34; The daina approached, summoning a fireball in her hand. The little girl payed no heed and continued to kneel over a womens body. At last Shielka stood right in front of the little one, but the girl never looked up, then she spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;Mommy, please wake up.&#34;The girl said. Suddenly Shielka stopped, the fireball disipated in her hand. She felt dizzy and fell to her knees. The daina looked at this girl and saw herself, so many years ago when her own mother had died. How could she kill this girl? <BR> <BR>&#34;What are you doing?&#34;Said a cold voice behind her. Both the young human and Shielka were startled by it, icy and void of mercy. It was Vor, his long saber driping with warm blood. Anouther of the Master warriors appeared as well, Flood. He was a pressure Golem/Zilla, a huge brute that caused the ground to thunder as he approached. He was also something of a quite type, rarely bothering to speak unless addressed by the Master himself. <BR> <BR>&#34;Get off you knees!&#34;Vor demanded, as if he was the superior&#34;There is such a thing as pride among us.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Who do you think your talking to??&#34;Shielka asked angrily&#34;I&#39;m the masters second in command! I&#39;m in charge here!&#34; <BR> <BR>Vor shrugged and took notice of the girl.&#34;Well now, how did you get away.&#34; He said, raising his blade.&#34;I must be losing my edge Flood, I could have sworn we&#39;d gotten them all. Oh well better late then- <BR> <BR>&#34;Stop!&#34;The daina jumped in front of him.&#34;There&#39;s no need to kill the child, she probably won&#39;t survive anyway. You&#39;ve finished here, lets move on.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Lorica laughed and stated&#34;The Master ordered ALL human&#39;s purged from this island. I will obey that command in his name. I&#39;d think you of all would understand this...but then again all you do is stand in the back and issue orders to us, the true warriors of the Master. Now step aside before you anger me.&#34; <BR> <BR>She didn&#39;t move and Vor pushed her aside and went after the girl. In a matter of seconds the girl would be dead, left with no time to think Shielka simply reacted and cast a mega ray into his back. The lorica was lifted into the air by the blast and flew right over the childs head, landing hard on the cobble stone path. The girl ran away and hid as a very angry Vor got to his feet. <BR> <BR>&#34;Vor, I&#39;m...&#34;Shielka could scarcly believe what she&#39;d done. Turning on anouther monster to save a worthless human, what was she thinking? Unfortunetly Vor wasn&#39;t interested in apologies and called over Flood. <BR> <BR>&#34;Seems we have a traitor on our hands,&#34;He said&#34;You know the rules daina... traitors will not be tolerated! I will now enforce the masters law, you will wish you had never betrayed us Shielka!&#34;   <BR> <BR>Suddenly she found herself between two dangerous opponents, Vor in front and Flood moving in behind her. They both charged, shielka turned and used flame against the pressure before taking to the air. Flood didn&#39;t go down, but the crimson fire was enough to stun him and stop his charge. Vor ignored his comrade and hurled his sword at the flying daina. She avoided it, barely, the sword passing through her right wing. Shielka couldn&#39;t stay airborn and was forced to land atop a building. Before she could even catch her breath, the building began to tremble. She leaped off mere seconds before the entire thing erupted in a hugh explosion. Landing on the street, Vor was there, waiting for her. <BR> <BR>&#34;Stand your ground!&#34;He said, rubbing his gauntlet along saber.&#34;Can&#39;t you even die with a single shread of dignity?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34;She said. <BR> <BR>Vor charged, trying to cleave his enemy in half with his blade. Shielka dodged the lightening fast attacks until Vor planted a kick to her midsection. Reeling from the blow she couldn&#39;t avoid the lorica&#39;s fist as it cracked against her skull. She fell, dazed, Vor hovering over her like a crimson vulture. Shielka wasn&#39;t beat yet however and blasted Vor with an orb of dark red energy. The force of it carried him 15 feet and straight through a brick wall before exploding, leveling the entire building. He was down, flood was nowhere to be seen, she seemed to be safe. But one thing had been forgoten... <BR> <BR>The ground began to shake under footfalls far greater then the pressures. The sky itself began to darken at the approaching sound. Then it appeared, a massive creature, deep black with blood red eyes. It was Darklon, a jaggernaut, perhaps one of the Masters most powerful and certinly the most feared. Shielka knew it was useless to try to escape, and even more useless to try to fight him. She hoped she could reason with Darklon, for despite his fearsome appearence and dark personality he was in fact the least aggressive of the warriors. Perhaps that was why he wasn&#39;t to popular with the Master. Then, the Dark Raven appeared from the heavens and settled over the town. The jaggernaut looked up at the raven and spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;Come, the Master will decide if you are traitor or not.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m disappointed in you Shielka.&#34;The Master said from the shadows of his chamber. It had been mere hours since the failed assault on Torlormec and his plans had hit a nasty bump. His ancient foes had located him at last, and, after the retreat he came here to gather his servents for the next stage. Grapper was lost, hundreds of his minons destroyed, the last thing the Master wanted to hear was that his second in command had turned traitor. <BR> <BR>&#34;Master, I haven&#39;t betrayed you.&#34;She said. The other warriors surrounded her, with liqua and a battered Vor on ether sides. This was all just an excuse for the Lorica to take her position, which he always coveted.&#34;This is nonsense! I have done nothing wrong!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;She let a filthy human escape, defended it and attacked me!&#34;Vor spoke, looking down on the daina like a lowly bug, one he was looking to crush.&#34;I have two witnesses, there is no doubt of her guilt.&#34; <BR> <BR>Shielka was about to protest, even lie if she had too. After all, this was just hearsay, her word against Vor&#39;s. Suddenly her head began to ache, the pain quickly became more intense. A horrible sound filled her ears, a presence, probing into her mind. Then, just like that it was gone, leaving the daina dizzy and drained. <BR> <BR>&#34;Vor&#39;s words are true,&#34;The Master said disapprovingly&#34;I made a mistake it seems, you are much like your mother, too much. I wonder how I could have been so wrong...well we learn from our errors. Life goes on.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;W-What are you saying??&#34;She asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;Your command is terminated shielka,&#34;The Master said calmly&#34;I have no use for a weak leader. You are soft and compassionate at heart, traits I tried to beat out of you and failed. Disappointing.....get rid of her.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You can&#39;t! It was just one girl!!&#34;Shielka pleaded, her dispair slowly boiling into anger.&#34;For years i&#39;ve served you, faithfully and without question. I did anything you asked of me, I&#39;d lay my life on the line for you...and this is how you repay loyalty!? Zarzaas, say something!&#34; <BR> <BR>The salamander shook his head and wispered&#34;Are you kidding? I&#39;m not getting kill for you.&#34; That said she looked to Talus, the only one she considered a true friend. Alas, the gaia held his metal head low. &#34;I&#39;m sorry child,&#34;He said&#34;It&#39;s out of my hands....&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Fine,&#34;She said, feeling angry and most of all betrayed.&#34;Damn all of you! <BR> <BR>Then, the entire ship began to shake as if in heavy turbulence. It had been a very long time since the Master had to deal with such insolence and was quickly losing patience.&#34;Repay?? You live only because I will it. An honor it is to serve me, to share in my victory and taste the fruits of the world I will create. I owe you nothing. Liqua, Vor, put her in a cell for now, we can always use some extra meat for our creations.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes Master!&#34;Vor said with some personal delight as they took Shielka away. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now my warriors!&#34;The Master said&#34;The time has come for the next stage, our next target...is Moo himself.&#34;
