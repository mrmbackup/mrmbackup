Chapter Nine:Only One Must Die <BR> <BR> <BR>	Deed coughed.  The little Mono Eyed was immediatley surrounded by the rest of the group.  “Are you okay, Deed?” Scaler asked. <BR>	“What happened?” Deed questioned everybody. <BR>	“Gengen just saved your life, that’s what happened.  He said he saw a bunch of Burner’s guys walking around carrying the Renneded Herb, and he killed them all and gave it to you--thank him,” Steele said gruffly. <BR>	“Thank you Gengen. I appriciate it.  Is there any good grub to eat here?  I need room service!  Room service, people!  I want a condo right away!  Get me some turkey and lobster for dinner. Sorry, Scorpio, I know you guys are related.  <BR>	Gengen smiled,  but inside he felt terrible.  What would they do to him if they found out that he lied?  Gengen did not know, but he knew why he had lied.  He had never done <I>anything</I> to help the rest of the group, but had only done damage.  It was his fault they ever met Katuum, and that evil Tasman had almost killed Minion.  Gengen was a reject, and he had been a reject his whole life, that was why he had joined crazy Minion on the way here.  He remembered that Baxter talked him into going, and that Mr.Freeze would boss them around.  Baxter would talk back and defend himself, but Gengen always ended up looking like a wimp.  He was partially disliked by Minion because he was always on Baxter’s side of things, and Scaler never noticed him.  His tent was the lonliest one.  Nobody ever visited it.  Well now  they would.  On second thought, how about if everybody  knew his name...it wasn’t going to happen, even if they defeat Burner.  The others would get all the credit. Stupid people.  Stupid morons. None of them where worth a penney.  From his father’s own words “You’re too kind, Gengen. Grow up and defend yourself, and be tough, like that kid across the street, Minion.” <BR>	Now he would be noticed.  Now everyone would like him.  Maybe if he turned to the bad side and did Burner a favor--then Burner would praise him as a hero, and his name would be on the timeline of all monster school books, mothers will say “You will turn from goat to hero like Gengen  if you eat your spinich”, and Burner would give him a tower of his own to sleep in.  Yeah,  what was the purpose of fighting with these crap boxes?   <BR>	<I>That’s it--I’m leaving this group.  Maybe I can get Baxter to join--if not, I’ll just have to kill him and the rest of these guys here.  Wait--what the hell am I thinking? I need my friends--and I won’t turn on them--well, I have a plan.  Only one must die.</I> <BR> <BR>					&#42;	&#42;	&#42; <BR> <BR>	Daina led her troops and looked on the map for the figures.  They were at the same place they were yesterday--this Jello would lose his life if the map were a fake.  On second thought...maybe it would be Burner who lost his life--not the noble Jells.  And she would be the one to take it.  Ahh, yes, the glory of betrayal.  A Muddy Jell fell down.  He was the only Jell on Burner’s side, and he was also injured from a battle against Akriel...but incredibaly strong. He was a smart Jell, and he was deep in concentration.  He had tripped over a rock without knowing.  He gave Daina a grim smile.  She couldn’t touch him, as he was second in command, commander of the Second Troop, and plus, Burner said.  But she was the leader on this mission, and Burner never said she wasn’t allowed to yell at him.  Anyway, as she was yelling, Mudd thought ‘Damn, she didn’t fall for it.  If I don’t silence her, Burner is going to kill me.  But...I don’t think I should listen to either of them.  So...oh, betrayal was sweet as chocolate.’  <BR>	“Um...I’ve gotta pee...can I go in the bushes?” he asked nicely. <BR>	Daina scowled at him.  “Take ten soldiers with you...we’ll take separate directions and attack on both sides.” <BR>	Mudd nodded and motioned for ten Monols.   “Now,”he hissed, “now you look away while I <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>.” <BR>	“Uh...okey-dokey,” Rocky the Obelisk said happily.  “I love the sound of <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> in the morning, don’t you, Bob?” <BR>	That was the last thing they ever said, as Mudd Gatling Gunned them all and left.    <BR>	“Now...to assasinate Daina.” <BR>					&#42;	&#42;	&#42; <BR>	“Now...to assasinate Burner,” Daina said.  “Umm...I have to take a <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>...so get the ____ away from me!  Go alone, in fact!  I have a splinter on my foot!  I’ll follow you.” <BR>	When they turned their backs she Gigarayed them all.  Except for a Rocky Fur, who was really  taking a <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>.  He saw the whole scene, horrified, then watched as Daina turned back the way they came, then he ran as fast as he could to Burner.    <BR>					&#42;	&#42;	&#42; <BR>	Gengen looked through his tent flap, and saw Steele approaching.  He had suddenly been taken “ill” and Steele was bringing him a plate of food.  Too bad, it wasn’t Steele that he wanted.   <BR>	“Here’s some medicine, Gengen,” Steele said kindly. <BR>	“Thanks.”  Gengen coughed miserably.  “Can I see Sea?  I need to ask him something.” <BR>	It was a puzzled Steele that felt his head.  “You don’t have a temperature...what’s wrong? Where does it hurt?” <BR>	Gengen motioned with his right arm to his stomach, and with his left                   arm to his head.  “Um...I’ll get Sea...” <BR>	Steele walked out of the tent, and motioned to Scorpio to follow him.  Puzzled, Scorpio followed.  “Uh...Sea...Gengen wants to see you.” <BR>	Sea shrugged and went into Gengen’s tent. Scorpio peered into the tent.  He saw Gengen point to his right arm.  “I saw a blade.” <BR>	“What?” Scorpio turned around to face Steele. <BR>	“I saw a blade.   And I am now seeing it again.  As I always will.” Steele spoke in a tone of voice that wasn’t his, and his eyes were wide like a maniac.   He took a menecing step toward Scorpio.  “Save him...I will not be fully...”  then Steele fainted.  Scorpio head a shout from the tent, so he turned around and saw Gengen kill Sea.   Leaping into the tent, he slammed Gengen to the ground and called for the others. <BR>	Gengen laughed, then whispered “You can’t touch me!” <BR>	“What makes you think that, traitor?”  <BR>	“Because only one must die.” <BR> <BR>The Journey of the Jells  <BR> <BR>Chapter 10: The Return  <BR> <BR>	Daina approached the castle.  The huge castle was black, stones of jewlery and fortune lined it.  The tower that Burner was in looked as if it would fall off, but it wouldn’t...it was enchanted.  Daina felt a drop of spit on her arm as Mack the Moron spit on her.   <BR>	“Whoo hoo!  That one hit that ugly tree over there!  That’s about nine hundred yards!”  a Naga crooned.  <BR>	“That tree is ugly...REALLY ugly,” Mack commented. “About as ugly as Daina, Burner’s girlfriend.” <BR>	Daina had enough of these bastards.  She said “As ugly as Daina, eh?” then spit on them...with fire.  “Thank god for my Dragon sub type.” <BR>	As she passed the shriveled and charred bodies of the Naga troop, she forced her way into the castle after killing the Worm on guard.  Next, she walked up the stairs, got ready to do Gigaflame, and shoved the door open.  Burner was standing his back turned.  “GIGAFLAME!!!” Daina screamed, and Burners body burned down.  But...wait... <BR>	“So.” <BR>	Daina’s last thought was ‘dammit!’, and then she felt her world going dark, and everything got blurry, and the last thing she felt was a fire wave going over her body. <BR>	Burner gazed out the window and saw his own troops coming to kill him.  They had formed a rebellion.  “@#&#42;!  Why me, why always me.  Well, it’s time.” <BR>	His body split up and the Phoenix carried the Jell away, through the window. <BR> <BR>					&#42;	&#42;	&#42; <BR>	Steele sat, with his cloak wrapped around him, mumbling “Only one must die...only one” while the others sat around him looking worried.  Baxter was questioning Gengen, who was tied to a tree and had Scorpio’s tail pressed against his neck.   <BR>	“Why?” <BR>	“You ugly moron, get away from me! I’m/too sexy/I’m/too sexy/I’m too sexy for my shirt!” <BR>	“ANSWER ME!” <BR>	“Um, totally bogus.” <BR>	“Just please...” <BR>	“Nooooo, I killed him!  Moron!” <BR>	“Tell me why you killed him.” <BR>	“I already told you, I killed him!” <BR>	Minion leaned forward.  “Steele has gone insane and you’ve killed Sea, and made yourself insane in the process. Why?” <BR>	“Backstreet’s Back! Awright!  Bye, bye,bye!” Gengen screached happily. <BR>	“Look, you retards, I have a quote for you, maybe that will help you get it,”Gengen said.  “Here it is: ‘I’m a regular guy, I don’t see why all this fuss about me!  Nobody ever gave a @#^! before, all they did was doubt me!’-Eminem, Marshall Mathers. Oh, and by the way...” <BR>	Then Gengen spit in Scorpio’s eyes slipped through the ropes by forming a puddle.  Then he turned into a cheetah and ran like crazy, singing “I want to get away!  But I can’t fly away, or they will catch me!” in the tune of the Lenny Cravitz song. <BR>	“Let him go,” Baxter said.  “Gengen doesn’t lie...Sea will be his only murder.  ‘Only one must die’ was what he said.” <BR>	Deed looked at Baxter and said “I thought that M&amp;M’s were candies!” <BR>	“Shut up, Deed,” Scaler snapped. <BR>	Steele laughed and said “Because I’m...just Marshall Mathers!” <BR>					&#42;	&#42;	&#42; <BR> <BR>	Mr.Freeze looked at the Jells with great interest.  “Gengen!  Bwahahahah!  Goody good Gengen?  Yoo-hoo! Dat is fuunnnnyyyy!  I can’t belive Deed is still alive, and they think I’m dead!” <BR>	“Anyway, Fever, will you put me down?” <BR>	“Sure,” the Phoenix said.  “Plus, we have to get back together every five minutes.” <BR>	And so both parts of Burner landed. <BR> <BR>					&#42;	&#42;	&#42; <BR>	Mudd looked into the sky and saw a Phoenix carrying a Jell, and he knew it was Burner.  He started Beam Gunning the sky, causing great fireworks... <BR>					&#42;	&#42;	&#42; <BR>	Big Bob looked out of his window to see a figure and rays shooting it.  He took his binoculars and immediatly phoned the Golem Village army.   <BR>	“Shoot the figure in the sky!” <BR>					&#42;	&#42;	&#42; <BR>	Minion got up from bed to take a drink of water, plus, it was his turn to take watch.  He saw rays of light shooting, and illuminating two figures flying in the sky.  He looked closer.  Was it...no, it couldn’t be.  “GUYS!  BEAM GUN THE SKY!”  just as a cannon fire shot towards the figure. <BR>					&#42;	&#42;	&#42; <BR> <BR>	“He’s GONE!” roared the Rocky Fur after breaking into Burner’s tower. <BR>	“Boss...Looooookkkkkk.  OOOOOOOOOOOHhhhhhhhh!” a Plant said. <BR>	He took a glance out the window.  “Fire in the sky!  Group one, forward!  Group two, back!” <BR>	An Automaton stepped forward.  “No, not this time.” <BR>	After killing the whole army, Otto looked smug.  “Jeez, those Telommeanns really are good.” <BR> <BR>	Finally, I wedged these things out.  What do you think?

 its good to revisit this story, jello - thanks for republishing it. <BR> <BR>im going to have to read it again - its fluctuation between telling the story and mocking itself for thinking that the story is important enough to tell, is a unique, but risky, story telling device.

 it is reminiscent of the detached, ironic style of modern movies - the one that comes to mind is &#34;princess bride&#34;.  at the same time the story is being told, the reader is constantly reminded that this is, after all, just a story - dont get too lost in it.

 &#34;it reminds me&#34; is another way to say it. <BR> <BR>here&#39;s another way to explain what i&#39;m saying.  in black razor or chb&#39;s stories, the story is simply there - you can forget the fact that there is a storyteller.  in your story, with self-references plentiful&#91;you even enter the story from time to time&#93; and with characters suddenly quoting &#39;right said fred&#39;, one is not permitted to forget that this is a story being told by a storyteller.

 Not really I suppose. I&#39;ve seen bad, this is not bad. I mean, REALLY bad. I actually like this one. Personally, I found it a wee bit hard to follow for a while. Often got a little confused on who was talking in some points. Other then those, not a bad plot. Character variation was hard considering they were all Jells, but you pulled it off well enough. Sometimes I do get them mixed up and get a little lost, but I manage to correct myself. LOVE the villin, though. Overall, not bad at all.

 I actually have to agree on this one.  I received the un-edited version a short while back, and my comments are very similar.  The biggest problem that I see is that you need to make it clear who is saying what and to whom.  This is a common mistake among beginning and intermediate writers, but is relatively simple to fix.  Of course, I also thought that Gengen snapping the way that he did was a little out of character...In my opinion, you needed to build up a little more of a psychotic background for him, instead of just having him snap without provocation.  Of course, I admit that I was sort of partial to Gegen, so that may just be my bitterness talking..hhahahah... <BR> <BR>The main thing to remember about writing is that everyone has a different style, like a  fingerprint, and each style can takes days, months, or even years to perfect.  I actually like the story, I just think you could be a little more precise on dialogue. <BR> <BR>&#40;PS:&#41;  The singing Jells absolutely cracked me up!

 Hm... I&#39;lll work on the dialogue.  Like I said, I  <BR>wanted Gengen to snap mainly because he  <BR>was the last person you&#39;d expect.  The only  <BR>thing I;m worried about is if I should have  <BR>killed someone else instead of Sea--like  <BR>Minion and then Scaler would snap, or  <BR>something.  But its too late in the story to build  <BR>up on Sea and Steele, so I decided to kill Sea  <BR>and eliminate Steele. <BR> <BR>This is near the end of the &#34;book&#34; but nowhere  <BR>near the end of the &#34;story&#34;, If you know what I  <BR>mean. &#42;Wink wink. Hint hint.  Nudge nudge&#42;   <BR>Thats all I&#39;m saying.
