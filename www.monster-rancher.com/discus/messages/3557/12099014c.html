How long has it been since I last posted an original piece...&#40;counts of fingers&#41; wow, almost three months hehehe. Even though this has nothing to do with monster rancher, i&#39;m still going to post it. It&#39;s about the other victims of the hoocuase, specifically handicapped people. Well, its yours to enjoy. -Icelord13 <BR> <BR><B>Souls of the Forgotten Innocent</B> <BR> <BR>Long have the souls of those perished wandered the <BR>depths of the afterlife <BR>Never forgetting; never forgiving. <BR>Innocents thrust into an eternity of pain and suffering. <BR>Their tears have spanned the surface of our planet for generations. <BR> <BR>Even after facing harsh treatment, malnutrition, and a most certain death, <BR>Many people have never even acknowledged their existence. <BR>They are those cursed to wander the afterlife as incognito specters. <BR>They are the souls of the forgotten innocent; they are those with disabilities; <BR> those who weren’t perfect. <BR> <BR>These were imperfect souls in a perfect world; <BR>doomed to be exterminated without a second glance. <BR>Many think of the Holocaust and they think of Jews, <BR>These people are forgotten, <BR>When they are as much of a target group as Jews, <BR>And are forced to face the death of millions. <BR> <BR>As of now, these handicapped victims are to be remembered <BR>as victims of the most terrible offense in the history of man. <BR>Those who were put to shame because of their differences. <BR>Even those with mental illness were put on death’s doorstep. <BR>  <BR>And now, we must remember those who faced unbeatable adversity, <BR>And managed to uphold their dignity and pride. <BR>And for those who didn’t make it; <BR>They must live on in our heats as honorable men and women <BR>For they must become the souls of the remembered innocent. <BR> <BR>Hope you liked it Please feel free to comment and critisize. -Icelord13

 Human history is a &#34;bloody gyre&#34;, more often than not conflict has been the only true impetus of human advance. As one philosopher said perhaps the only thing man has created without an application for violence is the toothpick. I laud you for reminding us that the end of all these tragedies is in remembrance &#40;to paraphrase Herman Wouk&#41;.  <BR> <BR>When we, young and old, all realize the enormity of the sacrifices made during the first and second world wars that got us to this relatively &#34;stable&#34; &#40;and I mean that in a very loose sense&#41; era, perhaps then we will vote more wisely and try to teach not just tolerance but acceptance of diversity.     <BR> <BR>At the end of the day, self determination and sovereignty have to be tempered with a certain amount of globalism.
