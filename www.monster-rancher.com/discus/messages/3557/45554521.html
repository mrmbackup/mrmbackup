<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>CHB</B> on <B>Saturday, July 14, 2001 - 10:01 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 What was fear? Dadge often pondered the subject with extreme prejudice. Was it involving your own life, or lose of? Was it the lost of another, or a horrific scene or event? The best Dadge could figure was that fear, was merely in everything&#39;s nature, reacting to different stimuli. He had never actually known fear, to an extreme anyway. De&#39;spyre was rather frightening, yet Dadge always had allies close by to protect him, so maybe he never truly knew fear. This time, Roketh was gone. The fear of the unknown and the known both struck him hard. Unknown if Roketh had acquired the final power he needed, knowing Dadge and his counterparts couldn&#39;t beat Kronock. His new definition of fear was quickly amplified. <BR> <BR>&#34;Rise…&#34; Kronock beckoned with unbridled command, as if the world would play dead at his bidding. <BR> <BR>From his mere word, his seeds began to grow. The one in front of Moonshadow appeared first. Three large tentacles emerged from the ground. They each landed and tugged at the ground, attempting to unbury their owner. Out came a form of spawn that mere words could not express the fear it caused. Its right hand was those tentacles, two of the three at least five feet in length, the middle one being over seven. Its body was almost human, but larger. Its left hand was one, solid blade of flesh melded together. The body was narrow, thin to a point not able to be reached by a human. Its legs were like grasshoppers, reversed joints. For those of you who don&#39;t know what that means, their knees pointed back, like their legs were turned around. One, large talon resided on each foot. It hissed at it turned to its &#34;Father&#34;. <BR> <BR>The last one, in front of Dadge, shot two, massive hands up through the earth. It laid its hands on each side of the new crater to pull itself up. Slowly, a large, singular horn emerged from the ground. As it rose, and rose still, a Golem finally appeared behind it. The Golem was well over eight-foot in height, with a large red horn that was over five. It grunted twice, once looking at Dadge, again looking to Kronock. <BR> <BR>The third, and middle one, exploded from the ground. Galin stepped back and gazed into the air. Basically, it was a demonic griffin. It landed in front of Galin with a screech. The head and wings of an eagle, the body of a lion, a griffin. Now, it had two, long horns going strait forward from right above its eyes. The one thing that they all had in common; they all were a dull red color. In each of their entirety, they were rust, a faded red blemish covered them. They all gazed at their creator with a look of wanting and obedience. Wanting their father&#39;s guidance, obeying his every command. <BR> <BR>&#34;Kill, my children…kill…&#34; Kronock said with a small grin, though he enjoyed it immensely. <BR> <BR>The griffin immediately took flight, Galin following close behind. Moonshadow darted to his left, the lanky beast perusing him. The titanic toddle turned to gaze down on Dadge, who powered up all his sabers, knowing all too well what a battle this would be. <BR> <BR>Galin&#39;s altitude climbed still as he chased the creature higher into the red sunset. Had Roketh failed? He had been gone for almost two days now. Galin didn&#39;t ponder this much more as his aerial foe stopped in mid air and turned. Galin never let up a bit as he plowed into the sternum of the upright griffin. It let out a half winded, half yelp, half screech sounds as Galin slung it off his shoulder. They were now even, on the same level, and flapping to keep it that way. Now it was a staring contest, each waiting for the other&#39;s next move… <BR> <BR>Moonshadow&#39;s coat shined with energy as tendrils slapped the ground about him. He ran between the being&#39;s legs, spinning in midair. As the beast turned abruptly it was met with a large surge of electricity. The shock sent it to one knee. It propped itself on its tendrils for support as it hung its head. As it looked up, it only saw a flash of gold and several hits from the Combination move in its face. It stumbled back up to its feet, moving backward. As Moonshadow flew through the air after his move, he instantly felt the tentacles wrap around him. One little one had his front leg, the other bound his mouth, and the third large one wrapped around his torso. The creature pivoted off its right foot, slinging Moonshadow to the ground beside him. Moonshadow felt ribs crack. Then, he was flying back through the air. The enemy now picked him up and slammed him on its other side. Moonshadow felt the hot tingle of lingering blood trickle down his brow, with a slight sting from the flying debris entering his wound. <BR> <BR>&#34;Moon Razor!&#34; Moonshadow screamed. <BR> <BR>As he did, the tendrils were shredded in a blur of golden light. Moonshadow charged toward his assailant with more than just blinding speed. When he reached the fiend, the beast attacked back. The result? A blinding combination of gold and dull, blood red. The two moved so fast that only a blur could be seen. Then, slowly but surely, the gold blitz began to turn red as well. Not dull red, but a bright shade to say the least. Finally, they both stopped. The creature was behind Moonshadow; its tendrils had grown back. Its back was turned toward Moonshadow, as in a still picture, neither moved. Moonshadow was covered in so much of his own blood that you could not see the glistening hide of a proud Tiger if you tried. His upper lip trembled a bit in a snarl, his eyes closed, and he fell over. Upon hitting the ground, the other monster looked at his daddy, hoping he was pleased. <BR> <BR>Dadge had never been on the defensive this much in his life. The thing charged and charged, then, it would charge some more. Dadge was flying backward. The creature swinging and axe-handling the ground every other moment. Dadge spun quickly and dove right past the demon. He slashed backward with his left wrist blade, inward with his right wrist blade, and inward with his right elbow blade. In other words, he slashed the gut of the beast three times in a constant row. When he got past the titan, he turned to see if it had fallen. It was now crouched over, holding its stomach. Dadge figured he had gutted it. Then, it spun with unbelievable speed for a Golem, and backhanded Dadge in the chest. The square dent that was there, now was inside a giant back-hand print. Dadge landed pretty hard, and slid a good way. His swords shorted, and he struggled to sit up. The monster had three marks on its abdomen, yet they only looked like scratches. The monster waddle over to his papa, hoping for his praise. <BR> <BR>Then, Galin flew out of the sky and landed flat on his back with a blood-curdling roar of pain. He had several lacerations up and down his body. Most of them were shallow, but some poured a rich blood, ones that couldn&#39;t be good. Galin lay on his back for quite some time before he rolled toward the other two, who were also down. Then, the griffin tackled Galin back to the ground. It hopped of and gingerly returned to its master. <BR> <BR>&#34;Very good, my children, very good indeed.&#34; Kronock said happily, &#34;Now, go into that hole. Somewhere there is a big, orange dragon with a big mean scythe. He wants to hurt daddy so, you better hurt him first.&#34; <BR> <BR>The three hustled to the hole, each hoping to get the kill before the other. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now,&#34; Kronock said slowly, &#34;Who shall I absorb first?&#34; <BR> <BR>Then, several horrific wails projected from the depths. Kronock watched the hole a bit confused as to what could cause such a sound. Then, the griffin fired out from the hole, screeching as it soared into the air. At first, Kronock thought it had been thrown, then he realized it was fleeing. The lanky creature ran out next, full speed. Its right arm had been severed at the wrist, but that quickly grew back with all its tendrils. It stopped beside Kronock; the griffin landing on Kronock&#39;s other side. The gigantic monster was now backing out of the hole. It tripped and fell back on the ground. It stared into the hole for a few seconds, and then it began wailing something awful. It rolled over and tried to crawl out of the pit. Then, a large scythe shot out of the hole, sinking deep into the creature&#39;s lower back. The giant then made something resembling a high pitched scream as it reached towards its father and brothers. The other end of the scythe was hidden in that portal to hell, but Kronock knew who it was, it had to be. Using the scythe like a hook, something pulled the creature still screaming into the pit. The screeching then reach a rather unsettling climax in there, followed by the sound of steel. The whooping increased ten folds, and then another sound of parting flesh followed by a heavy thud left only the most terrible silence imaginable. <BR> <BR>As a murky white glow emitted from the crevice, Kronock muttered to himself, &#34;No matter, he&#39;s still not strong enough.&#34; <BR> <BR>As Roketh&#39;s head and shoulder emerged, the two beings somewhat hid behind their master terrified. When Roketh&#39;s hands were visible, he carried his scythe in his right hand, that beast&#39;s head in his left. <BR> <BR>&#34;You dropped this…&#34; Roketh muttered as he tossed the head to Kronock, who slapped it aside. It fell to the dirt before its horrified brethren. <BR> <BR>&#34;He&#39;s not strong! You can take him in the open, now go!&#34; Kronock ordered his children. <BR> <BR>The griffin leaped into the air, its ground brother laid its tendrils behind him on the ground, and they twitched with anticipation. The griffin dove at Roketh&#39;s back as the other monster whipped its tentacles forward. Roketh slashed the tendrils off before they reached him, and continued to spin into the griffin. The lanky monster grew his tendrils back as he pulled his right arm to his right. It looked on in horror as the griffin split in two in the middle. It was not a very clean cut; blood spewed everywhere as the two pieces landed with a very unearthly plop. Roketh looked down on the foe, in an utter stonic matter. Roketh found himself bound by red tendrils now. The creature attacked him from behind. It spun and attempted to do Roketh as it did Moonshadow. As he did, he soon found it was like throwing a house. It pulled and pulled, yet the Dragon never moved. Roketh turned slowly, hands at his sides. Then, he rose them quickly, snapping his confines in several places. The creature howled and pulled back its right arm again. As he cradled it, growing back his appendages, he heard a rather fast thumping. When it looked up, Roketh was running toward him, and was already upon him, scythe over his head. He brought it down with a scream. He severed the beast on its right shoulder, cutting diagonal though it. The beast fell back; its upper body flopped a bit, then still. <BR> <BR>Roketh gazed at Kronock, who now had Dadge by the neck. Dadge was on his knees, facing Roketh. <BR> <BR>Roketh only stared at Kronock as his foe spoke, &#34;You never really did understand my purpose for searching for the perfect human, did you?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I didn&#39;t need to, it couldn&#39;t be good so I&#39;d kill you anyway. Might as well not let you enjoy life.&#34; Roketh said coldly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Let me enlighten you, dear ignorant Dragon. I am the perfect specimen, completed of the most powerful dragons ever, save you and Galin. I have also absorbed one of each monster, that is how I have so many abilities. Do you know what I lacked?&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh&#39;s answer was a rave stare. <BR> <BR>&#34;No clue? Well how about this…&#34; Kronock smiled, &#34;Human intuition. Top that off with human battle tactics and strategy, I&#39;ll be unstoppable.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I won&#39;t allow it.&#34; Roketh said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Roketh…&#34; Dadge muttered quietly, &#34;Let him…&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh looked at him shocked and said, &#34;But, I can&#39;t…&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge smiled through his helm and said, &#34;Just let him…&#34; <BR> <BR>Kronock laughed as he said, &#34;You want to feel this power? You are indeed lucky, human.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kronock shoved his left arm into Dadge&#39;s helmet. Dadge&#39;s screams were muffled, not quite understandable. Kronock&#39;s arm began pumping into his helm. Slowly, his shoulder began to twist and flow into Dadge&#39;s helm. Kronock was transferring his entire physical body into Dadge&#39;s. Roketh&#39;s watched in terror as the form of Kronock faded into the armor. Dadge grabbed his helmet with both hands. He was obviously in pain; his body was being eroded, through his skin into his blood, then organs. He was being transformed, or as Kronock put it, absorbed. <BR> <BR>Eventually, the flesh settled down and quit squirming. His hands lowered back to his side as he rose. Then, slowly, he raised his helmet. Dadge&#39;s face was still there, only it seemed to be made of rotten flesh and purple skin. One eye was blue, the other a fiery red. His nose was now a bit tilted, and his teeth had been transformed in a maw of sharp blades. This was made apparent as the new Kronock smiled. <BR> <BR>&#34;You can&#39;t win…not now…&#34; <BR> <BR>Then, a loud explosion rang forth. Kronock&#39;s form shattered from it. Dadge had hit a self-detonation sequence either before or during his transformation. It was his plan all along. <BR> <BR>Roketh watched in horror as the body reassembled itself, and Kronock chuckled a bit. <BR> <BR>&#34;It will take a considerable more than that now…&#34; Kronock spoke. He now sounded just like Dadge, slightly deeper and with an echo. <BR> <BR>Roketh looked into Kronock&#39;s blue eye; he saw a form of Dadge, banging against the iris, trying to escape. This phantom then began to fall backward into a deep abyss of lost souls, souls the Kronock had absorbed. <BR> <BR>Roketh grabbed his scythe with both hands and spoke, &#34;I will free you all.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kronock chuckled a bit. He looked like a beefed up version of a dead Dadge. His muscles pressed against the small armor, yet he was not up to Roketh&#39;s chest. Yet, the small creature walked toward Roketh, as if he was nothing to him now. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am the alpha, the omega. The beginning, and the end. I am the prime breed, the most powerful being ever.&#34; Kronock spoke as he raised his hands in the air, &#34;I am…the Amalgam!&#34; <BR> <BR>-Both of these archenemies are at their peak strengths. Who will win? Roketh has the power of all the lords, and Kronock has the abilities of every creature ever to live. You don&#39;t want to miss the final installment of Elements now.- <BR> <BR>CHB
