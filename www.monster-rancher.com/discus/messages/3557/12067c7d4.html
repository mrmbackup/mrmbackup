 One note before this chapter; In the battle, Balkaroth is reffered to as &#39;it&#39; to prevent pronoun confusion between it and Thenardi. Okay, enjoy. <BR> <BR>-------------------------- <BR> <BR>The clang of the bell rang through the air and Thenardi was away, dashing straight towards Balkaroth, claws gleaming in the sunlight. He knew that the golem’s strength and endurance were far greater than his own, so his only hope was to wear it down with repeated attacks whilst avoiding its crushing blows. Thenardi’s trump card was his devastating sonic attacks, but he had to be close to the golem in order for them to be fully effective. It was a risky plan, but he believed that his skill and agility would bring him victory. <BR> <BR>Balkaroth had braced itself and was prepared to counterattack. As soon as Thenardi came close it let loose, with astonishing speed for a golem, a thunderous left hook. But it had underestimated the incredible agility of Thenardi. He dived below the rocky fist and rolled, lashing out as he uncurled and catching it on the ankle with a swift slash. The golem’s skin was too tough to make a serious wound, but Thenardi’s claws took with them a smear of dark red blood. <BR> <BR>Balkaroth stepped back and tried to crush the mew by pounding it into the ground. Thenardi sidestepped and leapt onto the giant fist as it smashed into the soil next to him, then before Balkaroth could react, dashed up its arm and delivered two powerful slashes to its right shoulder and cheek. Balkaroth winced with pain and tried to swat Thenardi with its other hand, but the wily mew leapt over the stony fingers, over its shoulder and spun gracefully in mid-air, dragging his claws down the golem’s back as he fell. Two hundred thousand people gritted their teeth as the claws screeched down the stony flesh. <BR> <BR>Flailing wildly, Balkaroth struck a lucky back-handed blow that sent Thenardi sailing a full twenty yards through the air. He landed heavily, cracking the back of his head off an exposed rock. The coppery taste of blood filled his mouth. No. It was too early for that. He stood up, the slight dizziness assailing him confirming a concussion. Balkaroth had stridden over to a small oak tree. It ran its rocky fingers over the bark, as though testing for something. Apparently satisfied, it tore the tree out of the ground with terrifying ease, and swung it once or twice to get the feel of its new club. <BR> <BR>Leaping forward with surprising speed, the golem brought the tree down in a heavy two-handed smash. Thenardi flung himself out of the way at the last second as the oak slammed into the ground with such force that every single leaf disintegrated. Balkaroth swung the now-bare tree horizontally in a huge arc. Thenardi flattened, felling the rough wood brush against the tips of his pointy ears. He couldn’t keep this up much longer. A daring plan hatched in his mind. <BR> <BR>As Balkaroth swung the club round in the backswing, Thenardi leant over backwards and slashed above him as the tree passed overhead. A sound like someone sawing a loaf of bread filled his ears, and the upper half of the tree flew through the air and landed in the stream with a crash and a plume of water that soaked the first two stands of the audience.  Balkaroth gazed in astonishment at the stubby length of wood left in its hands, and then down at Thenardi. The chunk of trunk left between Thenardi’s claws smashed into its face in a shower of splinters, momentarily blinding it and causing it to drop the remnants of its weapon. As Balkaroth stepped back, rubbing its eyes in an effort to clear them, Thenardi seized his chance. He stood up and took a deep breath… <BR> <BR>A fantastic cry filled the arena. Supposedly unbreakable glass in the reserved boxes shattered spectacularly, filling the air above the fighting arena with millions of dazzling stars. Every spectator slammed their hands over their ears, for it felt as though their brains were trying to leak out from their lobes. Arithon sunk to his knees, blood trickling from his nose and ears. Even Cormac, who had built up a natural resistance to such attacks from his years of training, gritted his teeth and concentrated on staying conscious. This was unbelievably powerful, even for Thenardi. <BR> <BR>This was nothing compared to its effects on the target of the attack. The “cone” of sound smashed into Balkaroth’s chest, pitching the golem up and away through the air, tumbling violently, painfully, helplessly. All of its senses shut down, completely overwhelmed by the sound that seemed to fill the world. It smashed into a gigantic boulder over a hundred yards away with stunning force, before slumping to the ground at its base. Cracks zigzagged along the boulder’s surface and an ominous creaking was followed by a thunderous roar as the huge mass of rock collapsed and crashed down on top of the stunned golem, burying it in over two tons of rubble. <BR> <BR>An eerie silence descended over the arena as the dust from the destruction settled. The crowd was stunned. Had David beaten Goliath? <BR> <BR>Thenardi walked carefully over to debris, searching warily for any signs of movement. His caution was answered when the pile erupted, showering the fighting arena in huge chunks of rock. Thenardi gasped as a lump of granite cracked off his shoulder, sending shooting pain along the entire arm. Balkaroth stood up breathing heavily and clutching its chest – Thenardi’s attack had broken at least one rib. A thin paste covered where Thenardi had cut it, the blood and dust mixing together to form an ugly brick-red colour. Fury blazed in its eyes. <BR> <BR>A cold breeze began to blow. Thenardi watched with horror as Balkaroth began to spin around in big, slow circles. As it began to spin faster, dust was whipped up in the breeze, coating the arena in a choking mist that invaded Thenardi’s nose, mouth and eyes. Choked and half blinded, it was all he could do to stand his ground as the wind got ever stronger. Twigs and pebbles got sucked into the vortex, peppering his body with painful shrapnel. Through streaming eyes he saw that the golem’s body had now split into pieces, confirming that this was a cyclone attack. <BR> <BR>Balkaroth’s fist swung round and struck Thenardi in the back, pitching him forwards and into the maelstrom. Battered by rocks, branches and parts of the golem’s body, he was swung through the air, crashing through the branches of a tree and slammed against a boulder, the shrieking winds holding him tight against the rocky surface. The dust ripped against his skin like sandpaper, placing him in excruciating pain. Opening one eye, he saw the golems head floating in the middle of the cyclone, studying him intently. Despite appearances, Balkaroth was not a cruel monster and would drop the cyclone as soon as Thenardi passed out. It saw the mew was visibly weakening. One good blow should do it… <BR> <BR>Thenardi realised with horror that Balkaroth’s other hand had swung round and was headed straight for him, palm flat, and fingers spread, in a modified palm strike. Thenardi, with a herculean effort of will, lunged forward with both arms, claws drawn. A tremendous shock ran through both arms and something warm and sticky spurted over him. A cry of pain shooting through the chaos and the wind pressure slackening caused Thenardi to cautiously opened one eye. Balkaroth’s hand was scant inches from his face. He looked down and saw that his claws had been driven right into the golem’s hand, probably all the way through and out the other side. A line of blood reached from his belly to brow, sending a wave of nausea running through him. <BR> <BR>The wind lessened further, and Thenardi reached up and pushed the limp hand away with his legs. As it slid off, the wind abated completely and Thenardi dropped to the ground, panting heavily. The shock of the impact of the hand on made the pain in his previously injured arm become a terrifying numbness. The hand half-floated, half-dragged back to Balkaroth, a line of dark-red marking its progress. Balkaroth was not the only battle-stained monster, however. Thenardi was covered in cuts from where the dust, sharp twigs and jagged rocks had struck him in the twister, matting his soft fur with blood. The blood loss, coupled with his earlier concussion, made him feel light-headed.  <BR> <BR>The hand reattached itself to Balkaroth, who was about twenty yards away, swaying slightly. It was clear the last attack had been a tremendous strain. Although the hand was reattached, it hung limp and lifeless from its wrist. Neither monster could go on much longer. <BR> <BR>Balkaroth strode forward in an effort to finish the fight quickly. It noticed too late the glow emanating from Thenardi’s eyes, and roared in pain as a searing beam of heat struck it in the shoulder, pitching it to one side and dropping it to its knees. Thenardi, on his hands and knees, gulped for breath and concentrated for a second attack. The brief pause would prove fatal, as Balkaroth brought his hand back around holding what looked like a large rock which it flung at Thenardi. Instinctively, Thenardi tried to deflect it away with his eye beams. The “rock” turned out to be a clod of earth, which exploded as it was struck by the beams, throwing dirt into Thenardi’s eyes and blinding him.  <BR> <BR>As he desperately scraped the clinging soil out of his eyes he heard the golem stride over to him. Blindly, he leapt to his left and he felt the gust of wind from the golem’s fist as it passed to his side. He landed awkwardly, but managed to get the last of the dirt out of his eyes. But it was too late. Looking up, he saw Balkaroth looming above him, arm raised, a look of admiration and regret on its face. It brought the fist down, and suddenly the world went black. <BR> <BR>----------------------------- <BR> <BR>“NO!” <BR> <BR>Lisa pounded her fist against the glass in the participants’ booth, which had cracks running along it from Thenardi’s earlier attack. <BR> <BR>“Oh, I’m sorry about that.” murmured Neil from over her shoulder. “But he did put up quite a good fight, didn’t he?” <BR> <BR>“Not good enough.” Lisa muttered. “He’s going to be crushed…” <BR> <BR>“Hm? It looks as though the medics have been brought on.” <BR> <BR>“What?” Lisa spun around. “Oh, god…” <BR> <BR>“Well, that may make your decisions easier...” <BR> <BR>Lisa spun around, infuriated beyond belief. “What?! You think that I should be happy because my best friend just lost, that his monster may be seriously hurt, or worse, just so that it’ll make things easier for me?!” she shouted. <BR> <BR>Neil raised his hands disarmingly. The force of her fury had startled him. “Whoa, whoa, I’m sorry. That came out harsher than I meant. Just calm down.” <BR> <BR>The fury subsided quickly. “No, it’s ok. I’m sorry; I shouldn’t have flown off the handle so easily. I guess I’m just stressed – we’re pretty close in ability, so if he lost, then…” <BR> <BR>“I’m sure you’ll do fine.” <BR> <BR>She glanced at him suspiciously. “But you’re…my next opponent. Why are you being so supportive?” <BR> <BR>“I was just trying to be polite. I will be fighting my hardest, have no fear of that.” <BR> <BR>Lisa couldn’t help but shake a feeling of dread that lay before her. It was strange, for she was a natural optimist; but the defeat of Cormac seemed to have shaken her more than she cared to admit. She couldn’t see how she was going to win. It had been foolish for her to enter at all. Instead of enhancing her reputation, it was going to destroy the tiny sapling of fame she had nurtured so carefully… <BR> <BR>She shook her head. “I…I need some fresh air. And I want to make sure Thenardi’s alright…” <BR> <BR>“Very well. It looks like they need to tidy up the arena after that bout, so you probably have some time. We’re up after the next bout.” <BR> <BR>“Good…” <BR> <BR>Lisa walked out of the room. <BR> <BR>Neil smiled as he looked out of the window as Thenardi was taken off the field on a stretcher, Cormac alongside. People had always said that he could push their buttons, but they’d never known how true that was. How else had he gotten the wealth, power and privilege he held? It was so easy… <BR> <BR>-------------------------------- <BR> <BR>“How is he?” asked Lisa. <BR> <BR>“Not good. He’ll live, but I don’t know whether he’ll be fighting again anytime soon.” replied Cormac. <BR> <BR>He sighed, stroking Thenardi’s head. The mew was heavily bandaged, and the medic was still trying to tally up the list of injuries – dislocated arm, concussion, extensive bruising, cracked ribs, blood loss, and more besides. He hadn’t woken up yet. <BR> <BR>“I really thought I had a chance. I shouldn’t have let him get so badly injured.” <BR> <BR>“Hey, I don’t think he’d have stopped, even if you ordered him to. It’s not your fault.” <BR> <BR>“Maybe. It’s just seeing him now, so hurt, so helpless…” He sighed again, and turned to the medic.  <BR> <BR>“How’s Balkaroth?” The golem was recuperating in another part of the ward. <BR> <BR>“Not much better. Claw wounds to face, shoulder and leg, minor bruising to face, broken nose, two broken ribs, nerve trauma in left hand, third-degree burns…in terms of injuries, this match was a draw.” She frowned and stood up.  <BR> <BR>“Although it’d be better saying no-one won.” she muttered as she passed Cormac. <BR> <BR>Cormac shook his head. The crowd above his head roared.  <BR> <BR>“That’d be the next two combatants. That means I’m up next.” said Lisa. <BR> <BR>“You ready for it, d’you think?” <BR> <BR>Lisa paused for a moment. She thought: “Well, actually, I don’t know whether to be happy or sad because you lost because it’ll make beating you easier, my next opponent is a really nice guy who seems to have a thing for me that I have to beat soundly in my next fight, I’m suddenly aware that I may not be as good as I think I am and there’s two hundred thousand people outside who could be watching me crash and burn. Does that sound ready to you?”. <BR> <BR>What she said was: “Uh, yeah, I think so.” <BR> <BR>“You don’t sound too sure.” <BR> <BR>Lisa hesitated. “Alright, I know you can see right through me. Come on, I want a little privacy while I pour my soul out…” <BR> <BR>The two left the room into the tunnel towards the arena. <BR> <BR>------------------------------ <BR> <BR>The medic glanced up to make sure that they were gone. Then quickly and quietly she strode over to the stricken Mew. She knelt down next to him and took off the dark glasses she wore. Her eyes were a vivid purple. <BR> <BR>“This is the person that we have to rely on? The one who let his monster get hurt like this?” <BR> <BR>She sighed. She knew what she had to do. Taking off her left glove, she raised her exposed hand above Thenardi. A complex lariat of light slowly uncurled out of her palm and twisted around the fallen monster, flowing and swirling around his unconscious form. A wind blew out from nowhere, throwing the long black hair of the medic around her shoulders and causing her to shield her eyes with her other arm, yet did not disturb the medical papers lying on the bed Thenardi was lying on. The light cast strange shadows around the room, strange, unnatural shapes that no mortal eye should behold, and flowed through colours, changing gently from white to red to golden to blue and back to white again. <BR> <BR>After a short time, the light, along with the supernatural wind, faded. The medic stood up, mopping her brow, tired from her exertions. She replaced her glasses and tucked her hair back into place. <BR> <BR>“That should do it. I hope that this was the right thing to do…” <BR> <BR>“Tessa…” came a voice from the shadows. <BR> <BR>She glanced around. “It’s done. He’s been put in stasis – he’ll heal faster and be protected from their…weapon as well.” <BR> <BR>“Good. We should go – I fear you will be needed in the aftermath.” <BR> <BR>Tessa sighed. “I just wish…we could stop it somehow. Stop them now before it goes any further.” <BR> <BR>“You know we can’t. I truly wish we could. But if we try anything now, we’ll be killed. Then nothing can stop them.” <BR> <BR>She sighed again. “I know…but still…” <BR> <BR>She stepped into the shadows. There was a sound like whispering silk. <BR> <BR>------------------------ <BR> <BR>“So that’s it. I just don’t know if I can cut it. I’m…scared. What am I supposed to do if I give it my all, and it isn’t enough?” <BR> <BR>Cormac placed his hand on her shoulder. “Don’t be.” <BR> <BR>She looked at him. “That’s…it? No pep talks? Nothing?” <BR> <BR>He shook his head.  “’Fraid this is only something you can do on your own. I know that <BR>you can go out there and win – heck, on your day you can beat anyone. I know that you know that as well. But out there it’s just gonna be you and Cobalt. I won’t be there to hold your hand, or give you advice, or help you if you get into trouble. And that’s the way it’s gonna be sometimes. When I can help I will, but when I can’t I won’t. Sometimes, you have to go through the shadows on your own.” <BR> <BR>Lisa nodded slowly. She was amazed at the depth of Cormac’s emotion.  <BR> <BR>“Ok. I think I’m good.” she giggled. “You always know what to say to make me feel better.” <BR> <BR>Cormac blushed slightly. “So, you’ve been chatting with…Neil, wasn’t it?” <BR> <BR>Lisa’s expression went wooden. “Yeah…he seems nice…but…” <BR> <BR>“But what?” <BR> <BR>“I…well – whenever I tried talking with him, I…couldn’t think properly, you know? Like I was trying to…think through pink fluff or something…I dunno. I can’t really put in any other way. Plus I went completely berserk when he said some little unimportant thing. To be honest, he gave me a bit of a headache.” <BR> <BR>“Maybe he was just trying to psyche you out.” <BR> <BR>“If he was, he’s very, very good.” <BR> <BR>Another roar from above shook the tunnel. Lisa glanced upwards. “Listen, I’ll stick around to make sure Thenardi’s okay for as long as I can, but I’m going to get Cobalt first in case I have to go in a hurry.” <BR> <BR>“I couldn’t ask for anything more. I’ll see you in the ward.” <BR> <BR>Cormac walked into the ward. Glancing around, he noticed that the medic had left. Odd, after all it was her job to stick around here… <BR> <BR>He sat next to Thenardi. He noticed some kind of golden sheen that dusted parts of Thenardi’s fur that hadn’t been there when he’d left. Gingerly, he reached over and brushed his hand through it. A light golden mark remained on his hand. He turned it this way and that to get a look at it in the light… <BR> <BR>An agonizing pain tore through his head. He gasped in pain, sliding off the chair and holding his head in both hands. Another wave of pain tore through his head, making him cry out in pain. Consciousness became a desperate struggle, one which he was losing. As he sank to his knees, fighting with all his might, he screamed as a final wave of pain ripped through his skull. Suddenly, images flooded through his mind, like memories that had been forgotten but never experienced. <BR> <BR>A familiar face…two others…old friends that he’d never met… <BR> <BR>Explosions tearing through… a building, an arena… <BR> <BR>Monsters with black eyes and empty souls… <BR> <BR>Evil men with no pity, no mercy, no humanity… <BR> <BR>People fleeing, screaming, falling, dying… <BR> <BR>“NO!” he screamed, falling back on the ground. And then he knew. His eyes opened wide in time to see Lisa and Cobalt rush through the door. <BR> <BR>“Cormac! Are you okay?” <BR> <BR>“No, no, no, no. We’ve got to go, we’ve got to warn them!” <BR> <BR>“Warn who? About what? Cormac, just calm down…what’s wrong with you? You’re completely hysterical! Cormac, you’re scaring me!” <BR> <BR>“Lisa, come on, we have to go! Get out now! Go! Before it happens…oh, God…no…” <BR> <BR>Lisa closed her eyes, brought her hand back, and smacked Cormac hard across the face. The shock brought him back to reality. <BR> <BR>“I’m sorry, but you needed that.” she said as he raised his hand to the bright red mark that crossed one cheek. “Just calm down. What is it?” <BR> <BR>“Ok, ok.” he mumbled, rising to his feet. “But I’m serious. We have to…wait…can you hear…something?” <BR> <BR>Lisa concentrated. “Yeah…I can actually. A kind of…high-pitched whistling?” <BR> <BR>Cormac’s face was full of horror. <BR> <BR>“I’m too late…” <BR> <BR>A huge tremor ran through the floor they were standing on, throwing the two off their feet. As they landed in a heap on the floor, Cormac saw the tunnel leading to the arena come crashing down, preventing escape. Another quake rolled under their feet, pitching them against the wall. Cracks lined the ceiling they were standing under, and pebbles and dust rained down on them. <BR> <BR>“Lisa, get Cobalt to brace the roof or else….!” <BR> <BR>Another shock ran through the ward and the ceiling came down with a thunderous roar, burying all of its inhabitants under tons of solid granite. <BR> <BR>And up above, people began to die… <BR> <BR>---------------------------- <BR>As always, any comments/suggestions are appreciated. I&#39;d just like to point out it&#39;s surprisingly tricky to convey real anger/hatred/sadness without being able to use the naughty d-word. Oh well, guess I&#39;ll just have to find a way around it.

 Only if you use it a lot in real life, I&#39;m afraid, I found it very easy to avoid it. A good story, Great, even ...I forgot what comes after great. Whatever does, that&#39;s it.

 Careful when using an open-ended word like &#39;It&#39; to describe someone. Things can get pretty repetitive and confusing: <BR> <BR>&#34;It ran its rocky fingers over the bark, as though testing for something. Apparently satisfied, it tore the tree out of the ground with terrifying ease, and swung it once or twice to get the feel of its new club.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#39;He&#39; would have worked much better. For variety, perhaps &#39;The stone creature&#39; or &#39;rocky titan&#39; could have sufficed. Your story, thus your words though. I make only suggestions. <BR> <BR>Other than that, I enjoyed it greatly. Keep up the great work. <BR> <BR>&#40;Although, the first few exchanges were very, very similiar to the first fight Harvenger had in my story...&#41;
