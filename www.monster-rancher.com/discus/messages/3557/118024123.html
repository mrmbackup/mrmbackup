<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:king_usaf2003@yahoo.com>CHB</A></B> on <B>Thursday, February 5, 2004 - 09:09 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 &#34;500 years...&#34; <BR> <BR>Plague&#39;s eyes hardly left his front paws as he walked, and they never held such a look of insecurity in his life. Well, his old life. He watched the blades of grass twist and bend under his feet, but they did not bring the same joyful caress as they once had. It seemed like only yesterday, that emotion and feelings were still part of him. <BR> <BR>In less than a blink, he was here, totally unsure of the rhyme or reason that guided fate into such a cruel joke. He was not even sure how he died, but hoped it was one on one with the mighty Kade. He also hoped the dark Durahan had a scar to show from it. <BR> <BR>Grimlock was an odd name, like one used in the arenas. He had managed to uncover a book of necromancy and, being what he is, became infatuated with it. Somehow he could manage to get the bodies of the very old dead, to actually grow back partially. He had not, however, mastered full resurrection. Grimlock guessed he might learn the secret in the next five to forty years, but who could really tell. <BR> <BR>Now, they had went to nearly every major battlefield that had occurred since that time, but also had robbed various graveyards and headstones along the way. Most of the army were mindless husks of what they used to be, and few were even born before the time of Kade. The army was comprised mainly of fallen warriors, but if you were deceased, you were welcome to join. Dead farmers, old monsters, assorted other corpses walked in this army, doing only what they were told. An army of dolls made of decaying flesh, and few even recognized the name of their true enemy. One fighting ground, however, the Joker was very interested in. <BR> <BR>&#34;Grimlock...&#34;, Plague spoke slowly, walking beside the closest thing he could relate to a friend, &#34;Why are we going to Languard again?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Simple.&#34; Grimlock spoke solidly, &#34;We&#39;ll meet the master&#39;s forces directly north of the city. Languard has always had a large military force, now we seek to enlist them.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You mean the ones who fell in battle with Kade?&#34; <BR> <BR>The Joker smiled, a very sadistic grin that sent two consecutive chills through Plague, the first true feelings since being reborn. <BR> <BR>&#34;You don&#39;t mean...&#34; Plague almost choked as the realization finally took hold, and he managed to yell, &#34;You don&#39;t mean to siege Languard!?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...Somewhere in the mountains near Languard... <BR> <BR>The pure ape clamored up another large boulder. He couldn&#39;t stop , too much relied on him now. The crude, strait horn was slung over his shoulder, tied securely to his back with a long vine. <BR> <BR>Several birds erupted from the canopy at the base of the mountain, and the Ape stared back in fear. Certainly enough, they emerged. No doubt tracking him. They were very far down, however, and seemed like specs to him. Yet, he didn&#39;t know how long it might take them to catch up. He&#39;d better hurry. <BR> <BR>Bustling over the next few cliff edges and around a few sizable rocks, he came to the vine bridge. This erected path was no longer than five feet, but the Ape barked with glee as he sped across anyway. He grasped the railings with his teeth, sheering them off. The bridge fell limply to the other side as he howled once more, than continued on his way. <BR> <BR>Moments later, he found the cave. The most powerful being that existed in this forest resided within. The Ape dared not enter too far, less the monster&#39;s wrath be upon him. He undid the vine strapping around him, and gently placed the horn to his lips. <BR> <BR>The Ape&#39;s eyes widened as something like a wet fart squeaked out, not near being a call to the mighty creature. Blood slowly ran through the horn, and out the lip of the primitive instrument, and the Ape went to his knees. He glanced down at the miniature spear tip through his midsection. He jerked hard, and fell forward as the Gitan/Zan ripped his pitchfork from his gut. <BR> <BR>Limply, the Ape still managed to press the horn to his lips, blowing a loud, defiant sound towards his assailants. A JailKeeper&#39;s foot slammed on the horn, shattering it, along with the Ape&#39;s hands. He bellowed in pain as the Jet floated above his back, spear tip down. <BR> <BR>Suddenly, a stomp shook the earth, one that even made the massive Golem/Zan flinch. Glancing to the cave, they could see nothing through that darkness. Slowly, the rest of their posse funneled in, after jumping the affable valley. Assorted monsters gathered behind the two present, and gazed into the black hole with a certain sense of dread. <BR> <BR>A stomp sounded again, and again, as if building speed. The Golem braced for a frontal attack, but did not fathom the might of the furry fist that flew from the shadows. The Jailkeeper was sent spiraling through the air, landing very harshly on the red earth. <BR> <BR>Now, the creature stood for all to see, and fear. <BR> <BR>It was, for all racial purposes, an Ape. Yet, it was unlike any Ape you could imagine. Not only did it not squat or walk on its knuckles, but it moved solely on its two back feet. Walking upright, like a human, its upper body was a cascade of assorted muscles, pushing and thriving just beneath the skin. It looked like it shared the origins of a Ripper, with a white coat of fur, and purple streaks down its back and on its head, but its underbelly was completely black, as were his hands and feet. <BR> <BR>His right hand, however, was the real heart stopper. A giant, solid, rounded keg was literally implanted at the wrist. This giant piece of metal had small circular studs scattered all over its surface. Red dust had collected over the weapon, no doubt from years of living in these brutal mountains. That arm was easily larger than its counterpart, but they were both enormous at any rate. <BR> <BR>He turned to face the Gitan, that was still straddling the Ape in shock. The monster&#39;s face was black, like its underbelly, but the eyes, those blood red eyes, pierced all. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...Somewhere near Languard... <BR> <BR>&#34;Sir, our forces are almost finished with the encampment, placed about ten miles from the east wall.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Excellent, we will stage an initial ground assault from the east, while the fortress will begin attacking the west when they pull their forces to the diversion...&#34;, Moo smiled lightly as he added, &#34; We&#39;ll fall right on top of their castle.&#34; <BR> <BR>Standing at the head of the table, Moo pointed to the location the fortress would be on the map. The citadel of Languard would be heavily fortified, and a direct attack would get all of their forces mustered into the castle walls. That would prove difficult. However, if they sent soldiers to the opposite side of the city, they would be crushed much easier. <BR> <BR>Attending this war conference, were the mighty generals of Moo. Known as the Six, these monsters proved not only their strength in combat and dedication to their master, but also strategic geniuses. The best monsters Moo&#39;s army could provided, and that was a very large accomplishment. <BR> <BR>Immediately to Moo&#39;s left, was the one known as Kaidass. He was a Tiger, but his genetics were a mystery. Scientist had come to call this unknown breed Flazer. His bright red skin almost radiated in the darkness, and rumors abounded that his lineage was actually that of demons. With a grin that the battlefield feared, most believed this true. <BR> <BR>Beside him, was the Garu named Kul&#39;dratz, also known as the Nightsickle. This Zabel&#39;s gray hair stood up strait, and his dark red eyes didn&#39;t glint like Kaidass&#39;s did. Instead, they almost pulled all the light around them into a pit of nothing, no light at all. The one thing that did shine on this monster, was his fangs. The teeth of this Garu, enhanced with the power of a mighty Zan, were glistening white. Every time he was seen in battle, it wasn&#39;t his eyes that shown bright red, it was his smile. He stood silently on the edge of the table, hand on chin in thought. <BR> <BR>Last on that side of the table, mostly for a elbow room issue, was the titanic Beaklon known as Jagged. Jagged was banned from tournaments after his master ordered him to kill an opponent. His master, however, denied all knowledge. The mighty Golem cousin was to be placed in cryostasis, until he could be disposed of properly. He actually obeyed, but the day before this was to transpire, he had a very interesting discussion with a certain monster. This monster ordered him to kill his one time master, and smash the small town that condemned him. Jagged only knew how to follow orders, and when promised a spot at Moo&#39;s side, he agreed. That night of terror and death, was the only time this prisoner had ever felt true freedom. <BR> <BR>Standing to Moo&#39;s right, was the very monster who visited Jagged that night. Her red wings fell around her shoulders as a short cape, and her wonderful smile always seemed there. She did not, however, seem like the others. This Dianna was almost genuinely good hearted, for her kind anyway. People had oppressed monsters long enough, watched them fight and die like a common sport. She hated humans, the Dragon blood boiled in her veins at the mere thought of the brutality she had witnessed. Yet, she always stayed calm, and collective, to remain as dangerous as possible. To invite Kalanor into your folds, would be to invite death itself. <BR> <BR>Beside her, was the commander of Moo&#39;s assassins. Simply known as Skaythe, this Ripper was a ferocious opponent and master of stealth. The only member of Moo&#39;s council that descended form Jokers, this AssasiRipper was one of the, if not the, most dangerous monster outside of Moo himself. Skaythe spoke few words, as he preferred to let his actions tell his tales. When he did speak, he never taunted or gloated, but was giving orders or commands. Despite his lack of emotions and verbal communication, he was still a perfected killer. <BR> <BR>The sixth spot lay open, absent of the dark dragon&#39;s final general. Moo felt his jaw tighten as he gazed towards the empty spot, asking once again, &#34;Why isn&#39;t he here yet?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Would you like me to locate him, master Moo?&#34; Kalanor asked with her quiet, soft toned voice. <BR> <BR>Then, the giant doors creaked loudly. All eyes fell on the opening towers of iron as the mass behind them pushed forward. All in the chamber, including Moo, stared at the form that entered slowly. The room shook each time his foot connected with the ground, and he slowly made his was to his respected slot. <BR> <BR>&#34;Do you test me on purpose, Scarface?&#34; Moo asked harshly. <BR> <BR>&#34;No master, I was ensuring that Shinku and Rimowa have still not located the fragment, which they haven&#39;t.&#34; The pure Dragon spoke, bowing his head towards his master. <BR> <BR>He kept his right eye facing away from his leader, leaving only his scarred left socket to entertain his master&#39;s questions. <BR> <BR>&#34;You were late to a summon from me, Scarface, this insolence will not be tolerated twice!&#34; Moo&#39;s fist slammed into the table, which was secured to the floor. The chamber rattled as his hand connected. <BR> <BR>The other five breathed deeply, fearing the worst. Scarface, however, smiled anyway. After all, he was the only monster to have ever challenged Moo in battle, and survived. Moo was so impressed, that he instated him as the sixth general, not only for his fighting abilities, but also, his guts. <BR> <BR>&#34;The Kato, Harvenger, was the one that battled them in Kawrea. He is currently located somewhere in the city of Languard.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Languard!?&#34; Moo howled, slamming his open palm to the table, vibrating the room once more. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, master. If he is there, she must be as well. I ordered the brothers to keep up their search, and they will reach Languard by nightfall.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What luck has befallen me this day.&#34; Moo laughed, his massive shoulders bouncing his wings up and down slowly. <BR> <BR>&#34;I wish to go collect the piece myself, master. If you would allow me...&#34; The Dragon bowed his head again, this time, turning his head. His good eye shot a glance towards his master, and then lowered to the ground sharply. <BR> <BR>&#34;I need you here, despite what you feel for vengeance.&#34; Moo said strongly as he pointed towards the map again, &#34;Our assault commences tomorrow at nightfall. That gives them twenty four hours. If the brothers have not located them by then, we will most certainly uncover them when Languard falls.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Dragon bowed his head once more, knowing more than others the true wrath of Moo. <BR> <BR>&#34;I will do as you wish.&#34; He spoke obediently. <BR> <BR>&#34;I know, Hesferion.&#34; Moo answered. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...In Languard... <BR> <BR>He knew better. Closing those three into a corner would be suicide. He was powerful, yes, but when you back monsters into a tight spot, they can easily triple their abilities, purely out of adrenaline. Besides, they were trying to stop the fight at the arena anyway. <BR> <BR>Glory stood on the castle rampart, spear laid on the concrete wall. One arm propped on its elbow, hand supporting his lazy chin, and his other slid underneath, placed limply on the shaft of his weapon. His gaze ran over the wild forest to the east, and wondered if they could even survive there. <BR> <BR>None of his ten Jainnes had reported back yet, which bothered him. They were all exceptional warriors, still, he wondered if they might have been defeated by that little Kato. <BR> <BR>Glory smiled, remembering that monster. How hard he fought, but then how hard he fought to protect others. It was a totally different caliber, and woe be on any who would harm his friends to get to him. The old Centaur knew what would have happened if he had pressed that fight, knew that he would certainly have died. He sure would like to get a one on one shot with that rodent again, though... <BR> <BR>Suddenly, he noticed a shadow on the horizon. Slowly, it fluttered, almost walking on the canopy tops. The Pixie&#39;s silhouette leaned uneasily, but continued to move forward. Glory recognized one of his scouts instantly and sped towards the inner rim of the wall. <BR> <BR>Scanning the grounds quickly, he spotted three Jainne patrolling the city, and whistled promptly. As they realized it was the unconquerable Glory, they flew to him with a purpose. <BR> <BR>He said nothing as he pointed at the distant shadow, and they only gasped before bolting into the air. Moments later, they lowered a very beaten and injured Pixie into Glory&#39;s arms. <BR> <BR>&#34;They&#39;re...here...&#34; She spit lightly. <BR> <BR>&#34;That Kato will pay for this! Save your strength, you must survive.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Not...Kato...&#34; She gasped deeply as she placed a weak hand on his shoulder, &#34;Army...&#34; <BR> <BR>Her breathes quickened suddenly, trying to pull in enough air to sustain her, but it was not to be. The other three tried restoration spells, but none seemed effective. The Jainne passed on, and a wet eyed Glory examined the body the best he could to find the culprit&#39;s identification. <BR> <BR>Imbedded into her left shoulder blade, was something like a thorn. A small, purple needle on inspection, which one of the Jainnes recognized immediately. <BR> <BR>&#34;It is a spine from an Allure. Itself, it isn&#39;t poisonous, but it can hold magical properties.&#34; The Jainne&#39;s eyes saddened as she added, &#34;That&#39;s why we couldn&#39;t heal her.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Pixie snatched the needle from Glory, and threw it to the ground, blasting it with several magic attacks. After they were done, the needle lay there, still unbroken. <BR> <BR>&#34;Anti magic. Someone is going to attack us, wielding anti magic.&#34; The Jainne glanced at the Centaur, all too worried that Languard&#39;s triumph card was now void. <BR> <BR>&#34;We must inform the princes, and the king.&#34; Glory spoke, almost violently. He said a few soft words of prayer for the fallen comrade, then hastily sped off to make preparations. <BR> <BR>He should never have let those spies go. That trio of infiltraters were gathering information on their city the whole time. That&#39;s why they went to the east wall, they were mapping a route of assault! <BR> <BR>If they wanted a fight, Glory was never one to disappoint. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...Within the forest... <BR> <BR>&#34;We have to go back.&#34; Shilieka sputtered quietly, as they continued making their way south. <BR> <BR>&#34;We&#39;d be thrown in prison again. Either be executed by them, or killed when Moo sacks Languard.&#34; Lethander launched over his shoulder. <BR> <BR>&#34;We can&#39;t just let them win. We have to warn the other kingdoms then.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;And who could get here fast enough?&#34; Harvenger asked as he halted and turned to them, the other two stopping as well. <BR> <BR>&#34;Krouser is over eighty miles north of here, and they are the closest.&#34; Lethander whispered as he scanned the area intently. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, something must be done. We can&#39;t let Moo smash the most powerful kingdom here. The others will surely panic, and then fall likewise.&#34; The Pixie protested still, &#34;We can&#39;t let Moo have these fragments.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Another reason we should not return to Languard.&#34; Lethander sputtered, merging it with a question, &#34;What exactly is the deal with this disc thing anyway?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Some other time, Lethander, but he does have a point.&#34; Harvenger scratched his chin as he added, &#34;We can&#39;t risk Moo getting two for the price of one.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;But Languard&#39;s forces are powerful. Not to mention all of the tournament monsters and non military ones that would help defend. If we joined them, we could easily set up a defense and decimate Moo&#39;s plans.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Kato and Naga went silent. This was a very difficult situation. The Pixie, however, decided to play her main card. <BR> <BR>&#34;They will be there, Harvenger.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What?&#34; He asked, his brow crumpled as he added, &#34;Who?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;The Brothers.&#34; <BR> <BR>Harvenger&#39;s eyes widened, then narrowed sharply. He had not forgotten them. Mission or no mission, he&#39;d have both of their hearts burned on stakes. <BR> <BR>&#34;The who?&#34; Lethander asked stupidly. <BR> <BR>&#34;We go back.&#34; The Kato hissed through clamped teeth. <BR> <BR>&#34;Good, then it is settled.&#34; Shilieka smiled, relieved, &#34;We go back to Languard.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No...&#34; The Kato sputtered as he began marching north with an anger in his eyes she had never seen before. <BR> <BR>&#34;No?&#34; The Pixie asked, her face twisted with worry for her companion. <BR> <BR>&#34;All right, I am very confused now.&#34; Lethander piped in as he turned his head to Harvenger, &#34;Where are you going?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m going back...&#34; <BR> <BR>The Naga lifted his hands, and dropped them quickly as he popped his head back in disgust. Shilieka began following the Kato, Lethander close behind. <BR> <BR>&#34;You said we were going back, to where?&#34; She asked once again, almost desperate this time. <BR> <BR>The Kato&#39;s reason had faded. All courage, hope, honor, anything that stood between him and his most hated enemies must be removed. He would stop at nothing to kill them now. He knew not fear, nor anguish, only the hunger for revenge that drove him to begin his walk on the most suicidal mission he&#39;d ever undertake. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m going to crush that army...&#34;, was Harvenger&#39;s response. <BR> <BR>-Didn&#39;t proof read this an overly large amount. Apologize for errors in advance. Stay Tuned.- CHB
