 Hey folks!I&#39;m finally back!!!Yeah I know I&#39;ve been gone for a really LOONNNGGG time but now I&#39;m back!And I have finally thought up the final part to my stories.I hope you all enjoy!So here it is....The Destroyer And The Savior:Chapter 3:The Final Stand!!!    <BR> <BR>“X,I ca…can’t go any..further…ugh…” said Pyro the Garu as he fell to the rough ground.”Come on Pyro,we can’t stop now.” said X while drinking the last drop of water they had.X,Pyro and Sneezle have been traveling the vast cliffs of the New Island.They were looking for Fang and at the same time searching and unraveling the mystery of the beast-like creature they found…yes the scary Annuvin.But they have been walking for 3 days straight non-stop….. <BR> <BR>“Fang!!!Is that really you?!” shouted X.He finally saw Fang after 3 long days!X,Pyro and Sneezle rushed to Fang in open arms ready to welcome him back to the team.”Eheheh…” laughed Fang weakly.”Ouch you’re hugging too tight!”.But while the Pyro and Sneezle asked Fang some stuff X  saw that Fang had a big wound near his tummy.”Fang!!!You’re hurt!” screamed X.”Don’t worry about me X….” said Fang rolling over and falling down his feet.”Bu…and…but you…and it…Fang….Fang?” but before X could finish his mad talk Fang had gone to another world…… <BR> <BR>“Fang…Fang…….Fang!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” yelled X who was still trying to wake up Fang.”I’m sorry X…but Fang’s gone….” said Sneezle the Baku.And Pyro and Sneezle suddenly pulled X away from Fang and held him away until he calmed down. <BR> <BR>After 3 hours of uncontrollable anger X finally calmed down.”Well I guess there’s nothing we can do…..wait a minute Fang died because of that Centuar.Yeah it was that Centaur’s fault!!!!!!” yelled X.”Come on!We’re going back to the village!We’ll burn them all down!”.”No!” said Pyro and Sneezle both at the same time.They heaved X once more.”X!Get a hold of yourself.It’s not the Centaur’s fault.Don’t you remember what you just said a while ago???” said Pyro convincingly.And at that X put his head down and felt bad.”X there’s no use staying here.We should get moving……Annuvin isn’t gonna wait peacefully.” said Sneezle starting to walk again.Soon Pyro followed.And X too. <BR> <BR>And finally the 3 crossed the vast cliffs of the New Island.”Well that was long.” said Pyro trying to cheer X up.But X nor Sneezle said a word.”Raaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!I’ve had it.We have to avenge the centaurs,Fang and this whole world!!!We have to slay Annuvin!!!!Who’s with me?” rampaged X.”I am”. said Sneezle quickly.”I am too!” said Pyro while jumping and punching.”Then let’s go!!!” said X.The 3 then ran in the path that led to the dark lord’s domain…… <BR> <BR>The Castle Of Annuvin….. <BR>“We’ve made it.” said Sneezle.”Yeah.But can we get to Annuvin.” said Pyro.”Yes we can!For Fang and the rest of this world!!!” yelled X.And at that the 3 pushed the castle’s door all at the same time.The door freely opened and the 3 brave defenders of Earth entered……... <BR> <BR>”Welcome!” shouted a voice in a dark way.All 3 were startled and surprised.”Wh-who are you?!” asked the scared X.”Ha!Who am I?I am the one that turns the day into the night….the one that burns the happy faces of people…I am the one that punishes the good and rewards the bad….I am the one you have been looking for….I…am….Annuvin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!And I can see that you want to die.Well enough talk…it’s death time…..DIE!!!!!!!” said the evil darklord.Annuvin then showed himself to the 3 as a bird….of darkness!”You know…very few have seen me and my real form…and none of the few have survived….hehehehe!!!” said the evil Annuvin.Annuvin then shouted some weird magic words and shook his hands.And at that thunder bolts struck the Castle’s roofs and burned them down!”Ah!Let’s get out of here before we’re burned!!!” yelled X.The 3 ran out but Annuvin was outside as well in a flash.”Like I said….very few have seen me…and that few have died….” said  Annuvin while firing fireballs at X.”X!!!” said Sneezle.Sneezle then jumped and pushed X away from the fireballs.But he was hit instead.”Sneezle!No don’t die!!!” screamed X.”I’m sorry X.Take care…” but hope was gone for this Baku.”No!I’ve had it!You’ve killed all my monster friends!!!And I won’t let you have me or my human friend die!!!!!WaaaarrrhhhhH!!!” shouted Pyro.Pyro rushed towards Annuvin and gave him a taste of Fire!”Gah!Is that so?Well then human…die!!!” said Annuvin.Annuvin wiped the small blood of his cheek which was created because of the punch.He then raised his wngs high and blasted X with his deadly doom breath!”Ugh!” said X weakly.He fell to the ground with a loud thud.”X!!!!No!” said Pyro and rushed to X to hospitalize him.”I’m sorry Pyro…please make a new world for all humanity and monsters……” and at that X never spoke again….. <BR> <BR>“Graaaaahhhhh!You killed my friends and you killed my world’s heart.And now…I’m gonna kill you!!!!!DIE!!!!!” yelled Pyro while pointing at Annuvin.”Oh really?Then bring it on!” taunted Annuvin.Soon enough the 2 monsters clash and start pummeling each other.”I will never give up!!” said Pyro.He was now transforming!Transfroming into something white….he turned into the new chosen one!Pyro became an Angel Phoenix!A White Phoenix.”Wha?No it’s not possible!You’re just a Garu!” said Annuvin in surprise.”I am not Pyro nor a Garu anymore….I am the Chosen One!!!I am the Savior of Earth!!!I am the descendant of Lightix!!!” said Pyro the Angel Phoenix.He then blasted a holy beam of light to Annuvin.And so did Annuvin,he shot a dark beam of doom to Pyro….. <BR> <BR>And so the 2 beams clashed and chaos was created……dust fell everywhere and it was so hard to see.But after the dust disappeared the lifeless body of Annuvin was lying on the ground…while Pyro was standing up as if nothing happened but now as a phoenix.He then looked high up to the clouds and said “Did you see that guys?”.And they did…..who?X,Sneezle and Fang!They were all there waiting for Pyro.”We’ll save a space for you here Pyro!” shouted X.And X,Sneezle and Fang then waved goodbye to Pyro from afar.Pyro waved back and the 3 disappeared.But then before Pyro looked away another person appeared…..a holy boy…….Lightix was his name…. <BR> <BR>This is the story of how Earth survived a tragic end…how the life of a team changed…….and now that you know it…..don’t tell it…. <BR> <BR>The End <BR> <BR>&#40;Well that was hard well dudes what do you think?Is my story cool or not??Got any tips for my next great story?Then say it!&#41;
