 Harvenger felt his hair begin standing on end as more and more monsters pouted out from their slumbers to great him. Now that the Brothers were here, he had enough trouble as is. This was a fight that was quickly not favoring his odds. From pure adrenaline, and instinct, he ran. <BR> <BR>A Rocky Fur bounded in front of him, punching forward. The nimble Kato rolled under, with a quick swipe, and proceeded in his course. The Hare behind him stood for a second, then fell to the earth with a thud. <BR> <BR>He still ran. West he hoped, right back towards Languard. What was he thinking, coming here alone. Was vengeance so important to risk any future chance of having it? <BR> <BR>The thoughts were pushed aside as a large, black axe flew wildly towards him. Harvenger ducked as the weapon ripped through and collapsed the tent behind him. The now unarmed Durahan charged anyway, alone and unafraid from the crowd of confused monsters. <BR> <BR>The black armored monster kicked directly at him, but the agile Kato avoided the blow with a quick hop into the air. The other metal foot quickly was in the air as well, passing around the Durahan in a roundhouse. Harvenger twisted his body just over the following attack, and began his decent to the ground. <BR> <BR>The Elite soldier fell with his roundhouse to one knee, punching directly at the falling Kato. Harvenger brought his claws in front of him in a flash, sending sparks flying in between the dueling monsters. <BR> <BR>The Durahan ignorantly gazed at his now fingerless gauntlet. Who knew that Durahans could look stupid? <BR> <BR>The cat like monster darted past the metal creature a few times before he continued his escape, each pass sending a wave of sparks into the already confused masses of the freshly awaken monsters. As the Kato sped onward, the Durahan fell to his knees, slowly looking towards his body, holding his hands out in front of him to gaze at his arms as well. Gashes, always in sets of three, lined his black armor, penetrating completely through it. <BR> <BR>Even after gaining a few yards, Harvenger still heard the iron monster land on the earth, never to terrorize again. He still had to admit, these Durahan were good. <BR> <BR>Still he ran, knowing that most of the army had figured it out by now. Suddenly, two sounds entered his mind more than the rest of the clamor. Two sounds utterly odd for monsters to make, but one was very, very familiar. He had heard it before... <BR> <BR>The day Howard died... <BR> <BR>Glancing over his shoulder, he saw one following by air, the other by ground. Regardless of the shape they took, he would always recognize Shinku and Rimowa. <BR> <BR>A white and gold Noble Jell was behind him. He had two wheels, his mocking face over the front one. Two, horizontal horns came from behind his head, and the rear wheel was ripping up dirt. The Kato first thought it was a variation of the Rhinoroller, but wasn&#39;t quite sure what this creature was. It made loud, high pitched revving noises as it chased him. <BR> <BR>The other was the one present on that day. The flying, blue bird. The four arms spinning above it, the round tongue sticking forward, training in on its target. He knew not the names of the creatures they assumed, but he would never forget them for what they truly were. Murderers. <BR> <BR>Rimowa&#39;s mouth opened, and he stuck a very similar shaped tongue towards Harvenger as well. Suddenly, both Jells began to scream. White and blue orbs flew past the Kato, who bounced off tents, poles, crates, and assorted enemy monsters to dodge the volley. The spheres were like the ones used then. They shattered and clasped on to whatever they hit. <BR> <BR>All three of Harvenger&#39;s right hand claws tore through the mid section of a pure Henger. As he passed it, he turned and jumped quickly, giving a very powerful kick to its back. The top half flew towards the aerial Jell. The helicopter made an insane right bank, disappearing into the darker sections of night. Rimowa held fast, running over the legs with only a mild bump under his tires. <BR> <BR>He screamed on, launching his ammunition at this evasive target. The Kato sprinted around a corner, between two tents. Dead end. He needed to come up with something, and fast. <BR> <BR>Rimowa screeched his wheels as he spun, digging his tires to a stop. His gun retracted into his mouth as he stared into this alley, full of crates and posts. His army was confused for the most part, not certain of how many were attacking. The Noble Jell knew, at least, there was one, and he was in here somewhere. <BR> <BR>The Jell slowly rolled into the blackened area, searching for his prey. He heard several slashes and wails from behind him. His face morphed into himself, then appeared from his taillight. Two dead Bajarls lay at the entrance to this dead end, and that rat stood between them, smiling at Rimowa. <BR> <BR>In a solid yell, the entire motorcycle warped, and reemerged, facing the other way. The back tire tore into the ground as he sped towards his foe. Harvenger ran to his right, attempting to escape again. <BR> <BR>As the Jell reached the gap in the tents, a set of claws came from the edge of the tarp. His tires erupted in a bang and a shower of white globs. He sped uncontrollably forward, and splattered into several poles. The Kato smiled, but only for a moment, as the furious Rimowa rose. <BR> <BR>He was himself now, with a noticeable change. On his right shoulder was a long box, with four holes in the front of it. An arm emerged behind him, grasping a few posts from the stack. He slid them into the back of this rectangle, and the Kato knew this would not be a pleasant thing. <BR> <BR>The first pole exploded from the weapon in a blur. Harvenger bounced up, spread legged, as it harpooned the ground beneath him. As he landed on it, he had a severe look of shock and awe across his face. Then he realized the second one coming. He performed a side flip to his left as another pole whizzed past, and the third was on approach. His left hand shot up and out as he rolled forward. The pole splintered down the center as the two halves planted into the earth. <BR> <BR>He was running again, but two more bangs followed him. He ducked sharply as two Zan landed in front of him. Each was nailed with a medium sized log, impaling one, and cutting the other in half. The Kato glanced back, noticing the white Jell grasping a few more poles. <BR> <BR>Speeding between attacking monsters, and a barrage of attacks, Harvenger wondered how he could escape this madness? Then the beating sound of the four arms reached into his ears. <BR> <BR>One loud bang issued seconds before a sharp pain tightened on his back. The Kato didn&#39;t even see the blue strap latch around him until it was too late, and he was being lifted into the air. Gazing up, he saw a long, thin and limp arm connecting him to Shinku&#39;s belly. The flying beast sped forward, Harvenger dangling from the rope shortly behind. <BR> <BR>Suddenly, the creature swooped low, and pointed its tail to the ground. The hand released Harvenger, but then he figured out Shinku&#39;s plan. The Kato was now flying right into the four, twirling blades, as the creature flew towards him backwards, and slightly up. <BR> <BR>Thinking quickly, Harvenger began spinning opposite of the arms, pointing both claws strait forward as he closed his eyes. The ground was instantly alive with blue slime. Monsters slipped and lost their footings as the Jell rain fell on them. Harvenger found himself landing very harshly through a tent roof. <BR> <BR>The Draco Mocchi laying beside him blinked a few times, confused by the blue Kato that now shared his bed. Harvenger also held this eye contact for a moment, caught in a slight stupor, also. <BR> <BR>The Kato walked out of the tent abruptly, tossing the severed Mocchi head to the ground, before continuing his battle west. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...In the forest... <BR> <BR>&#34;I see, Chieftain.&#34; <BR> <BR>The very sophisticated sounding Ape spoke slowly, left hand rubbing his iron club. <BR> <BR>&#34;This is...a task...&#34; The old Bossy spoke, &#34;That I...can trust...only to...you...Shinjin.&#34; <BR> <BR>The might guerilla stood tall outside the elder&#39;s tree hut. Being so large, he could not possibly fit inside, especially since he was already standing at eye level with it. The wise, old Ape sat on the balcony, briefing his servant of the happenings in the world. <BR> <BR>&#34;I know, Elder. It is my time to act.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Is it...hidden?&#34; The old monster asked between coughs, &#34;Will they...find it?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No, Elder, it is buried.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Good...good.&#34; The Ape&#39;s wrinkled lips pulled upward, in a smile that resembled pride as he said, &#34;You&#39;ve...always been...our guardian. Now...I&#39;m old...but you...never aged.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;My curse, Elder. A curse of older, darker times.&#34; The beast spoke lightly, still respecting the elder, who deserved that respect. <BR> <BR>&#34;A curse...to the bearer...&#34; The old monster chuckled, &#34;May become...a gift...for those...he protects...&#34; <BR> <BR>The monster said nothing, merely turned, and with heavy feet, began marching south west. <BR> <BR>&#34;That is...the wrong way...&#34; The Elder protested as he raised his shriveled hand towards the monster. <BR> <BR>&#34;I have to go meet a friend.&#34; The one called Shinjin answered, &#34;A very, very old, friend.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...In the camp of Moo... <BR> <BR>The pure Zuum&#39;s body fell to the ground, its severed neck twitching lightly as its head landed nearby. The blood soaked Harvenger ran still, killing as he went. The Brothers hounded him constantly, the two most powerful and resourceful Jells he had ever fought. Yet, in the middle of this army, what chance did he stand? <BR> <BR>A purple Gaboo landed with a plop in front of him, clinching his fists for the fight. The Kato never let up a step, as his left claw sped across his chest, and his right went immediately behind. <BR> <BR>The Gaboo screamed as he gawked at his twin bloody stumps, and Harvenger ran still. He couldn&#39;t keep this up. How many had he killed so far? Tens? Hundreds? <BR> <BR>The thoughts left again as a Garu fell to his wrath, adding more to his kill count. Was he no better than Moo&#39;s soldiers? Was he bred for war and large scale slaughter, too? <BR> <BR>Did he...enjoy it? <BR> <BR>His mind was freed from such civilized ideals such as thought, as the revving roar of Rimowa entered his skull. The instinct to flee redeemed itself as the Kato slashed through a Mew, hastening his retreat. <BR> <BR>Suddenly, the ground in front of him ripped and tore as an Icy Jell exploded up. Twirling in mid air, Shinku turned into a giant blue orb, and came spinning down at Harvenger. He was preparing to slash the ball head on, but that was before the giant spikes sprang from it. <BR> <BR>The Kato swiftly ducked into the hole Shinku had been hiding in, and as the Jell flew over. The blue orb ripped the ground beneath it, as Harvenger resumed his westward flight, his path to freedom. <BR> <BR>Sadly, more obstacles presented themselves. <BR> <BR>He entered a cleared area of the camp. Several, old fire sites were scattered here, in what must be the common area. In front of him, was a sight that only the Brother&#39;s of Misconception or Moo himself could match. <BR> <BR>There had to be, at the least, fifty of the black Durahans, each wielding the customary axe. They stood in a line, three deep, each grasping the hilt of their weapons tightly. <BR> <BR>&#34;I abhor handicap matches.&#34; Harvenger chuckled at the thought of this challenge and, in almost a sadistic way, he added, &#34;You&#39;ll need more...&#34; <BR> <BR>As if on command, the first row charged, the second walked slowly, and the third held their ground. The Kato ran strait forward, ducking and bobbing through the oncoming monsters. Axes, gauntlets, and metal boots all flew at him, and missed. Harvenger shattered legs, arms, torsos, whatever he could hit as he punched through. <BR> <BR>The third line stared in awe, as he severed the head from one of the black knights, and continued running west. All the Durahan threw formations to the wind as they chased him in a gaggle. <BR> <BR>The Kato breathed heavily as he felt the pain now. He couldn&#39;t dodge all of those shots, and now the hits were sinking in. At least, he thought thankfully, he didn&#39;t catch a direct hit from an axe, but he wasn&#39;t as lucky for the blunt traumas. <BR> <BR>The wind beat down behind him as the sound of Shinku became readily clear. Looking back for a moment, the Jell had indeed returned, but this time, something else caught his attention. <BR> <BR>The white and gold bike fell from the bottom of the chopper. Landing roughly, it wasn&#39;t enough to slow down Rimowa. His face was still on the front, that high pitched, annoying laugh echoed forth as well. Harvenger hated that laugh. What kind of new trick were they going to pull this time? They were very unpredictable. <BR> <BR>A loud bang issued forth, and Harvenger watched in amazement as they over shot him. Slamming between two tents, directly in the path he was running, the twin, blue beams began breaking and busting into smaller ones. Each main pole acted like a tree, sending extensions into the tents, and ground, each other, making what seemed like an impassable barrier. The Kato, however, got an idea. <BR> <BR>Shortly before this blockade, he turned. Holding his ground, prepared to fight as the Brothers laughed in unison. Rimowa and Shinku opened fire at the stationary monster, but were quickly surprised. Harvenger&#39;s claws sped in front of him as he ducked left and right, shattering the incoming missiles. <BR> <BR>Rimowa ceased fire and charged forward, laughing crazily this time. Then, the Kato realized one folly in his plan. The broken orbs latched onto him, holding him in place as the murderous Jell fell on him. He&#39;d have to time this perfectly. <BR> <BR>The Noble Jell was no less than five feet away when Harvenger&#39;s claws flashed through the air, leaving dozens of white lines following the path of his claws. His bindings splattered the nearby tents. Immediately he made a small bounce, and Rimowa slammed into the little Kato in mid air. <BR> <BR>Rimowa blinked a few times, starring at the rodent attached to his face. The Kato retracted his left hand&#39;s claws, and placed his knuckles to the monster&#39;s nose. The blades fired through Rimowa&#39;s head, and Harvenger growled harshly as the Noble Jell laughed, even with the three claws extending through his face. <BR> <BR>The barrier. <BR> <BR>Harvenger leapt from his new found chariot, flying into the cool night sky. It was still amazingly bright now, with the moon beaming down like it was. Harvenger glared down at his foe with astonished eyes. Rimowa slammed into the barrier, and ripped and tore completely through. The blockade, however, gave none. <BR> <BR>The shredded Jell reformed himself on the other side as the Kato landed beside him. Harvenger braced for an attack, but Rimowa fell limp to the ground, almost whimpering. Was a Jell able to feel pain? <BR> <BR>The Kato glanced back at the spiked bars, and saw what had him in such anguish. The bright red heart was snagged between two extensions. Lucky him it didn&#39;t get impaled. <BR> <BR>For Harvenger, that is. He wanted to do it himself. <BR> <BR>He dashed for the red orb, Rimowa being completely numb to anything but his pain. As Harvenger reached the wall, it became alive, the stiffness faded as several arms reached for him. He slashed them defiantly, but saw three grasp the sphere, hiding it within their folds. <BR> <BR>Another time. <BR> <BR>The Kato resumed his flight, and was now able to see the trees he had emerged from. So he hoped, but any amount of forest was better than this. <BR> <BR>Two Allures appeared in front of him, with their attacks already charged up. The two white balls flew with a purpose, twisting around themselves in a mesmerizing dance. <BR> <BR>Well, almost mesmerizing. <BR> <BR>Harvenger bolted to his left, pulling his right claw back as he dodged one orb. He hooked the underside of the second as it came over him, and slung it with all his power back towards them. They took to opposite directions as the energy flew past them. An explosion rang from behind, inside one of the tents. The cloth had several burns appear through it as the white energy inside forced it to collapse. Another bang sounded, but it was somewhere in the other side of camp. Their other attack, to be sure. <BR> <BR>As they glanced towards each other in a guilty fashion, a yellowish form fell between them, dragging three, white lines down each of them. Harvenger crouched only for a second as he continued to flee. They starred at each other in shock, both crying as they saw their partner fall in slabs, and felt their own body separate, too. <BR> <BR>He couldn&#39;t stop now. He was so close. <BR> <BR>Something large slammed in front of him like a meteor. Dust flew past him, almost as if attacking, as he brought his hands over his eyes. As the dirt settled, he saw the beast within. <BR> <BR>The bone Dragon gazed at this runt with a bit of humor in his bellowing chuckle. What possible threat could this thing provide? <BR> <BR>The meatless tail whipped wildly towards our hero, but his great speed paid off again. He dodged the first and second attacks with ease, the first ripping through a tent, the second crushed a Joker. The Dragon growled as the point of his tail straitened out, in an attempt to impale this speedy Kato. <BR> <BR>The point rammed itself into the ground, and the Dragon&#39;s mouth opened slightly, in shock, as Harvenger ran up his spine&#39;s extension. The bone monster whipped his wings across his tail, attempting to remove this pest. <BR> <BR>He was gone. The small, annoying, yellow rat had disappeared. The Dragon&#39;s gaze quickly ran towards the forest, but still saw not the Kato. He roared angrily at the knowledge he had lost him, and started to stomp back into the camp. <BR> <BR>Before him, stood three of the black Durahans, axes at the ready. They stared at him, not sure of what action to take. The Dragon tilted his head, slightly confused, then he felt something. Something inside him didn&#39;t feel right. <BR> <BR>Glancing down at his rib cage, he could see what that feeling was. <BR> <BR>Harvenger smiled stupidly, pulling his right hand behind his head, holding a rib with his left. The Dragon was so furious that words would not express the damage he&#39;d place on this Kato. He bellowed loudly as flame began filling his mouth. <BR> <BR>It would not end this way. <BR> <BR>The armored monsters watched in horror as the rodent began to spin, sending chips of bone flying into the surrounding area. The Dragon&#39;s breath disappeared as he stared, confused, into his chest cavity. Slowly, a tornado pushed past his legs, colliding with the ground with an uproar of debris. The Dragon&#39;s body, regardless of magical properties, couldn&#39;t hold together in this mighty storm. Chunks of, and eventually entire, bones flew up with the winds, only to fall into the encampment moments later. <BR> <BR>The Dragon howled in pain as he grasped his body with both hands. Fear entered his eyes as the three armored monsters were not going to let the fur ball escape again. <BR> <BR>Harvenger was a bit confused when the entire Dragon shattered, but was instantly aware as a black axe barely missed him. He bounded out of his attack, running for the forest edge still. He looked over his shoulder, realizing he over did it. That massive twister was an exclamation point for his location. <BR> <BR>Luckily, he finally had an advantage now, as his small, blood soaked body flew into the foliage. Assorted monsters following close behind him, each set to avenge their fallen brethren. <BR> <BR>He could hear the four arms in the night sky, and knew that the rest of the night would be just as tough. <BR> <BR>-Enjoy- CHB

 Ooooh, nice. I think it will get better when the joker and Harvenger meet. As usual, no gripes, few minor mistakes in spelling, but no gripes. I happily await 14.

 Somehow, writing the last couple of chapters and writing this one felt different. I guess I&#39;m a writer that can &#39;feel&#39; his work. <BR> <BR>Either way, writing this felt like I was writing my first few chapters again, I got the rush of it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m quite pleased now that I can harness that feeling. I actually had an ENTIRE chapter 13 written, but decided to write an alternate, if you will. <BR> <BR>Well, here is the alternate.

 Very nice. Another blood bath perfectly written by one of the Princes of the MRM Library, CHB. You are awsome, CHB, awsome. I wouldn&#39;t mind reading the origional Chap 13 while eagarly awaiting Chap 14. &#42;Hint&#42; &#42;Hint&#42; &#42;Hint&#42;

 A Prince? Hardly... <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think I could ever selfproclaim myself to any sort of greatness. Not my style. <BR> <BR>As far as the other chapter goes, sorry, it is long and gone. This one is more bloody though, with a better lead into the next couple of chapters. <BR> <BR>In the alternate though, Harvenger beat the crap out of the Brothers. So bad that I had to rework it. :D <BR> <BR>Of course, everyone knows he&#39;ll get a chance, or will he?   o,0
