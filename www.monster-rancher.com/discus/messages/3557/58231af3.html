 Interesting... <BR> <BR>Jorus could not find 0446.  He knew where all the other monsters were.  Some where in the orchards, some were playing, some were working, some were resting.  Henger 0446 was not in the orchards, the fields, the training grounds, nor the stables.  Henger 0446 was nowhere to be found, and vital to Jorus&#39;s next Expedition.   <BR> <BR>Over the years of studying monsters, Jorus had become intrigued with the Henger breed.  The concept of a walking machine interested him.  He had delved deep into the most basic concepts surrounding the Hengers.  Hengers were a walking construe, an automaton, regulated by the presence of a soul.  A soulless Henger body was merely a pile of metal, usually buried by trainers, but melted down by such men as blacksmiths because of its unique properties.  Often gravediggers would rob the graves of powerful Hengers and sell the metals for insane prices.  Those who were caught were not taken peacebly by the defending trainer.   <BR> <BR>So far, twelve men had been executed in the Zentai area for the graverobbing of a Henger.  This was taken as a defilement and a violation of a monster&#39;s rights.  Unfortunately, many other areas had not taken such an positive view of monster breeding and saw the ownership of monsters as &#34;natural right.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Hengers Jorus had bred had given their consent--something not to be taken lightly--to their bodies.  Jorus had delved into the darker art of isolating, trapping, and transferring monster souls.  If anyone knew of his practices, he would most likely be branded as an outlaw.  He would be lucky to get his peach and Mock.   <BR> <BR>The Henger body was a little more then animated by a soul; specifically, Henger bodies grew as long as they were animated.  But souls grow old or are damaged, and sever their link with bodies.  Most monsters find this as imminent death.  To isolate, trap, and transfer the soul of any monster but a Henger was to kill it.  However, the soul of a Henger could be ushered into another being with a minimal amount of fuss. <BR> <BR>The first losses had been costly.  The art of trapping a soul is at best inaccurate; a few precious monsters had lost their lives in Jorus&#39;s attempts.  But now, the crystallised souls of ten-score monsters awaited reawakening in new bodies.  The soul of a Golem within a Henger would reconstruct the body into that of a &#34;Gaia&#34; Henger, and if the soul was removed, vice-versa.  With this, any compatible soul could be transferred into a Henger as long as it was young--or healthy--enough.   <BR> <BR>The six innate skills of monsters--Life, Power, Intelligence, Skill, Speed, and Defense--were altered somewhat by presence.  Intelligence remained the same during transference, but Life, Power, and Defense were relative to the host.  Skill and Speed, if high before the transference, would drop, but eventually regain somewhat original properties when the soul became used to its body.   <BR> <BR>Zombification was a different matter, though.  Slave-souls were broken souls that lived beyond their time and were re-instated into a new body.  Normally a dead one, and its own.  The monster would remain with the body until it decomposed entirely, which could take a while.  But, the monster would work dutifully to fulfill its master&#39;s assigned tasks, even if it pursued them lazily.  Zombification was as forbidden as the trapping of souls; but Jorus, though familiar with the methods, did not practice Zombification.  He saw it as a waste of precious time.   <BR> <BR>Jorus believed that the Henger body was made by a foreign agent.  Such ability to free roam souls and power in an artificial form meant powerful means and vast resources.  His suspicions were confirmed when October came by and indulged his tastes.   <BR> <BR>The Hengers began acting strangely; not within reason, but began to work harder towards some, unknown goal.  Faster, stronger, and smarter, they dutifully went about their chores and tasks.  It reached its peak on the fourth week, about the end of October.  Then there was a gradual decline in activity.   <BR> <BR>When observing the moon, a sort of &#34;False Moon&#34; was made evident.  Out of schedule, it came around the area, then hovered over a spot for a bit, then continued on.  When checking the calculated spot, they found a large, circular Lodestone.  Peculiarly, it did not mess up the Henger&#39;s circuits as lodestones do so well. <BR> <BR>About one more month--it is now September--and it happens.  And Jorus would be there with 0446 to journey on the False Moon Expedition.   <BR> <BR>Jorus&#39;s accursed new assistant would be coming soon; hopefully, he could get her to leave the ranch for a bit while he went on his trip.  But he would tolerate her as long as she did not do anything to jeapordize the ranch&#39;s existance.   <BR> <BR>But... <BR> <BR>Where had 0446 gone..?
