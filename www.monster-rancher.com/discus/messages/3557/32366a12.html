<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF='mailto:seliah@guildworld.com'>Seliah du'Kasi Shr'Lan</A></B> on <B>Sunday, February 18, 2001 - 05:19 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 Chapter One <BR> <BR>Seliah flies high above the land, needing the flight to calm her down. She carries only one small travel bag, which holds only a few items…sentimental things: Khelan’s flute, his staff…a journal that she had kept from when she learned to write…and Khelan’s journal. She had also taken to carrying an assassin’s blade in her right boot. At present, the staff was strapped to her back with the help of a leather sash, as she knows that travel outside her home in the forest was rife with danger. <BR> <BR>Feeling the need to get away from the hut that seemed to only remind her of her years with the bard, she had struck out on her own. She was now flying over what looked like a small trading town. Typical for its size, the town of Helan’tu possessed several taverns, a mine, an open-air market, and agricultural facilities. She could see the farmland from her vantage point in the air. Coming in for a landing, Seliah was careful to keep a wary eye out as she moved towards one of the better kept taverns. <BR> <BR>She moved out of the way of some merchants, and ignored the call of another as she stepped towards the tavern. Pausing outside of it, she raises her eyes skyward, to read the hand-carved wooden sign above the door. In harsh, utilitarian script that had obviously weathered many years, she could just barely make out the words Helan’tu Inn and Tavern. <BR> <BR>With a sigh, she shoulders her pack again, and climbs the steps, opening the door, and stepping inside the mud and brick building. Moving to the side, away from the doorway, she gives her eyes a moment or two to adjust to the dim lighting within. As she does so, and gets a good look at the patrons, she makes a note to be careful here. Many of the patrons looked travel-weary, some wealthy, others obviously poor, and even a few that looked like downright pirates. She saw one man over in a corner give her a good once-over with his eyes. Seliah allowed her eyes to flare bright red to the man who was obviously a slaver, judging by the collars and shackles on his belt. A warning. She was Fire Elemental, and even if her control over the Fires that burned within her was shaky, and uncertain, she at least knew that she could defend herself. <BR> <BR>Stepping further inside the tavern, she makes her way to a corner table, not feeling much like drinking at the moment. Sitting down, and self-consciously folding her silver wings to her back, she drops her bag onto the table in front of her and looks around her. Apparently she’d turned several heads upon entering, as she saw several gazes quickly avert from her as she spotted them. <BR>With a sigh, she dropped her forehead onto her bag, forcing back her feelings. She missed Khelan desperately, and felt lost without him… <BR> <BR>The sound of a chair scraping next to her jolted her out of thought, her eyes flashing a dangerous red as her hand reached for the assassin’s knife that she carried. The man sat down with a friendly smile, and placed a mug of ale in front of her. <BR> <BR>“You look tired, M’lady. Here, have a drink. On me.” <BR> <BR>Eyeing him warily, Seliah pulled her bag a bit closer to her, and studied the man who just plopped himself into a chair across from her. She looks from the ale to his face, still without speaking. What was she supposed to do? He had just sat down uninvited…but one look at him, and she knew that she would be outmatched in a fight with him. The stranger was at least six feet eight inches tall, and must have weighed no less than 350 pounds…all of it muscle tone, from the looks of things, too. <BR> <BR>Obsidian black eyes that studied her calmly were set into a harsh, squarish face, that seemed to be sizing her up. More than a little nervous, she pushed her chair back a little to study him. A white shirt that was loose across massively broad shoulders, and brown leather pants were offset by a black cape that was tied in the front of his neck, right at the collarbone, with a round, gold medallion of some sort. The cape flowed down his back, stopping at mid-calf, where high black boots took over. Curly black hair flowed to mid-thigh, held back with a simple leather tie and almost blending in with the cape. He wore a long sword on his belt, accompanied by twin daggers, a heavy crossbow on his back with pouches of the necessary ammunition, a short sword, and a very large knife, about ten inches in length not including the wooden hilt, and four inches in width, double edged, and unevenly serrated, and hooked at about a fourty-five degree angle. A nasty-looking weapon, to say the least. There was also a light crossbow strapped to his hip, with a full quill of arrows and bolts on his back. <BR> <BR>Buying for time, Seliah sighs, and toys idly with the mug of ale. “Might I ask ye’re name, Milord?” she says, without drinking from the ale. The man across from her simply smiled that friendly smile again, and drinks his own ale. <BR> <BR>“Of course you can ask, M’lady…call me Midnight. I’m a hunter.” He says calmly, those black eyes seeming to be amused at her obvious nervousness. “You don’t need to fear for your safety, M’lady…I hunt down slavers, not take them. I won’t harm you, I assure you.” <BR> <BR>Watching her seriously for a moment, Midnight drinks his ale again, now even more certain that she was young than he’d been when she’d made her entrance in here. “May I ask your name?” he asks of her, watching her silver eyes change color. Silver one minute, and endless black the next, red the next. Strangest thing he’d ever seen… <BR> <BR>“O’ course,” she says quietly, rising from her seat. Midnight was about to protest, but stopped short as he saw why she’d stood. With a full smile at the moment, Seliah spreads her silver wings out to their full seven foot wingspan, the dim light inside causing them to shimmer like water, and turning them a slight blue as well. It was one of the most magnificent sights Midnight had ever seen…and he was speechless for a good minute or two afterwards. Unfortunately, the entire tavern had seen it, including a particularly annoying slaver. <BR> <BR>“I be Seliah du’Kasi Shr’Lan, Milord Midnight, tis a pleasure.” She smiles a little, and brushes some stray locks of snow-white hair out of her eyes, then bows slightly and folds her wings to her back again, self-consciously. Midnight found that all he could do was stare open-mouthed for a moment at the sight of her wings. He hadn’t known she had them.  <BR> <BR>As she sat back down, he saw her give a sharp glance to the opposite corner of the common room, and watched as those silver eyes of hers burned red a moment. Following her gaze, he saw the same man that had eyed her upon her entrance. The slaver had actually been his reason for approaching her table in the first place. He guessed her to be very young, almost too young to be traveling on her own, as she obviously was…  <BR>Instinctively touching a hand to the knife at his belt, he gave a warning glare to the slaver. Leave her alone or else, the look said. The slaver simply smiled politely to Midnight, but his eyes had been drawn to the faery’s wings as she had greeted her companion. <BR> <BR>With a soft sigh, Midnight allowed his hand to remain on his knife. Damned if he was going to see such a lovely thing sold on the slave market. Recognizing the importance of the gesture Seliah had just given him, Midnight himself stood a moment, and gave a full bow to the lady, bending at the waist, and then rising again with a soft smile. <BR> <BR>“Ye can just call me Seliah…most find th’ whole name tae be difficult tae remember…an’ me own father tended tae just use mine first name.” Seliah said, pulling her red eyes from the slaver, and trying her best not to look as nervous as she obviously was. Young indeed, her companion thought. <BR> <BR>“Such a large name for such a small creature.” He says. “Well, it’s an honor to meet you, M’lady Seliah. You are a sight for sore eyes, I assure you.” <BR> <BR>Not too sure what to make of that, she just settles for drinking from the ale he had placed in front of her. “A sight for sore eyes? I’m afraid I nae understand ye, Milord.” <BR>With a light chuckle, Midnight shakes his head. “Nevermind, I only meant that in places such as these, it’s not too common to see such a beautiful creature…or one who is obviously a lady.” <BR> <BR>With a raised brow, she smiles a little, slightly embarrassed. “Thank ye, Midnight.” She didn’t really trust her judgment at the moment, but for some reason, she was inclined to believe this bear of a man who sat in front of her, eyeing the slaver so coldly, while at the same time managing to not ruin the charm he was using on her. <BR>Suddenly serious again, as he drank from his ale, Midnight leans forward, placing his elbows on the table. Seliah can just barely see the hilt of a small throwing knife poke out from under each cuff of the man’s shirt. <BR> <BR>“Seliah, may I ask what one so young is doing traveling alone? And in a tavern, of all places, for that matter. It is not precisely…safe, for one like you to do so.” Midnight says quietly, watching those eyes of hers change back to silver, then shift to a sort of grey, as he asked his question. Amazing… <BR> <BR>“I…” to his surprise, she just sighs, and bows her head a little. He watches her shoulders shake a couple times, and reaches a hand out to her, touching her shoulder comfortingly.  <BR>“M’lady? Are you alright?” he asks, brows furrowed in concern. “Forgive me, I did not intend to upset you…” <BR> <BR>But she just sighs again, and shakes her head, turning positively vivid blue eyes to him now. Another colour…he makes a note of it. Her eyes are moist, obviously from an attempt to hold back tears. <BR> <BR>“Nae, Midnight…tis nae ye’re question.”  <BR>She sighs softly, and looks down into her ale again, white hair falling forward over her shoulder a little. With a determined shake of her head, she takes a deep breath, and looks him directly in the eye, her own blue ones even more vivid than a moment ago. When she speaks, her voice is so soft that Midnight has to lean forward and turn an ear towards her in order to hear her words. <BR> <BR>“I be travelin’ alone because I ‘ave tae. I be alone.” She shakes her head again, not sure if it was wise to divulge that information, but something about this man in front of her seemed to assure her that it was safe. “I ‘ave come from the Shr’Lan forest…tis a twelve day flight from ‘ere. I…” she looks down from him again, and if possible, her voice gets even softer. “I ‘ave just buried mine father…and ‘ave tae support mineself…I be lookin’ for work…or somethin’ that I can live off o’…” her words trail off, and she just sighs once more, raising those wide eyes to look at him. <BR> <BR>Speechless for the moment, Midnight just squeezes her shoulder gently. “I’m sorry, M’lady.” He says simply. <BR> <BR>With a suddenness, that Midnight was unprepared for, Seliah lifts her head again, and shoots a sharp glare once more at the slaver. Her eyes flare brilliantly, and he can practically hear some sort of discussion going on. His left hand tightens on the hilt of his knife as he turns to look at the slaver. <BR> <BR>She turns back to him, slightly pale. “Do ye know if there twould be any rooms still vacant here?” she asks uncertainly. Midnight nods, thinking that this is not the safest of places for her to bed down, especially with a man who had obviously decided she would fetch some gold on the slave market. <BR> <BR>“Aye...there are, but…” <BR> <BR>“But what?” <BR> <BR>“Seliah, how old are you?” he asks, instead, keeping a wary eye on the slaver. <BR> <BR>“How old…? I be sixteen seasons, Midnight. Why do ye ask?” <BR> <BR>“No reason, just confirming a guess.” He removes his right hand from her shoulder, still amazed at how much of her shoulder his hand had covered. At her sharp look, he smiles a little. “I knew you to be young the moment you walked in here, M’lady. As did any who saw you enter. I merely did not realize how young. Your barely old enough to be outside of your home village. And to be traveling, especially with your age and the fact that you are alone, is extremely dangerous for you. You do not have any traveling companions, correct?” <BR> <BR>She just nods, without speaking. Her eyes continuing to dart back to the slaver. Midnight takes note of this, also the tension in her jaw as she again appears to be conducting a conversation with the man. Then suddenly, without warning, the girl stands up from her chair, her hand tightening on her bostaff. Her eyes flame once more, and she sings. So very softly, but enough that the talent of her voice delays him from throwing one of his knives at the slaver for a brief moment.  <BR> <BR>&#40;&#40;Bringing the rest over to a second post, since otherwise the message is too large for this post...&#41;&#41;

 &#40;&#40;Second half of Chapter 1...&#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>She puts her left hand out, palm towards the slaver, and a small fireball explodes into existence, and heads straight for the slaver. It was too small to last the distance it had to go in order to reach its target, and do any damage, but the intent was obvious.  <BR> <BR>The man simply looks at her, a smug smile on his face as the fireball fades from existence halfway between the two. He stands up, and moves over to the table where she was. Now on full alert, Midnight stands as well, as people begin moving away from the sight of the conflict. He steps around the table, to guard the girl from the slaver, and takes a step forward, preventing the slaver from approaching the faery any closer. <BR> <BR>“I would suggest you go back to your seat, Zaret. You will not collar this one.” He states flatly, one hand on that ever present knife at his belt. <BR> <BR>“Oh, won’t I, though? She will bring in a large sum of gold on the market, I believe. The winged ones always do, especially the young ones.” He says with a smirk, his eyes sizing Seliah up.  <BR> <BR>She just glares at him, her eyes red. That small fireball had been just a warning. Both hands clench into fists, and she gives the slaver a look of loathing. She does not speak, but sends the thought at the slaver. <BR>~~Leave mineself alone, or ye’ll soon find yerself in trouble.~~ she thinks to him, tightly gripping her bostaff.  <BR> <BR>She knew she wouldn’t stand a chance in a real fight against this man, but she sure as hell wasn’t going to simply allow him to collar her without a fight. <BR> <BR>The slaver just smiles at her. The smile of a deadly predator. “Oh, but you will be in my company soon enough, Little One. I promise you that.” He speaks, in answer to her telepathy. <BR> <BR>~~Nay, I won’t!~~ Glaring, her eyes blazing, she grips her staff even tighter, and turns it into a battle-ready stance. <BR> <BR>“I say again, Zaret. Go back to your table. Drink your ale. Leave her alone, or I will skin you here and now.” Midnight growls softly, but emphatically. <BR> <BR>“Oh, no need for threats, my man. No need. I wasn’t going to harm the girl.” Zaret smiles thinly, his eyes lingering on Seliah once more, the lust clear in the brown orbs as he backs away. Without another word, he turns his back to the two, and retakes his seat at his table, and proceeds to watch her closely. Let that hunter leave her side for even a moment, and he would have her. <BR> <BR>“Bullshit.” Midnight snaps, and pulls his knife. “Leave. Now.” He spits out as the slaver backs away. The look in the man’s eyes had not been lost on him, not at all. He turns to Seliah again, his gaze deadly serious. <BR> <BR>“Milady, while there are indeed rooms here, I would advise you not to stay here. That one is dangerous, and determined. He has marked you…it would be in your best interests to acquire a traveling companion, and to find yourself another establishment to stay at.” He says quietly. <BR>The girl just nods, her red eyes still on the slaver, and quite pale. Midnight raises a brow. Apparently, she had some inkling of what went on in slave camps, or she would not be nearly so upset by Zaret’s advances. That was a good sign…it meant that the girl was not completely naive.  <BR> <BR>“Tis good advise…and I twould ‘ave done so already if I could ‘ave…but…I nae ‘ave ennaone else. Mine father twas me only family…an’ we didna live in a village…” she shakes her head. “And I’m nae so stupid as tae just ask ennaone here. Nae...alone it twill ‘ave tae remain.” She says quietly, still eyeing Zaret with a tight grip on her staff. <BR> <BR>Midnight merely nods. He had expected her to say as much. “Then I shall travel with you. I do not wish to see you subjected to that sort of treatment.” <BR> <BR>Seliah studies him for a moment, her eyes indecisive…then she nods, once. “Aye. Twould be appreciated, Midnight…thank ye.” <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		 <BR> <BR>From across the room at his table, the slaver watches the two talk, growing somewhat impatient, though still calm. “Ah, yes…my little silver-winged Angel…you will wear my collar soon enough. And then you will go to see Orion…and he will tame you...” With a cruel smile, the slaver chuckled to himself, and set about waiting for the hunter to leave. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		 <BR> <BR>As they finish their drinks, Midnight stands, offering his large hand to the faery. “M’lady?” <BR>Seliah nods, glancing around them once more, shooting a poisonous look at the slaver, and accepts the hand, pulling her bag to her shoulder and gripping her bostaff as she stood. <BR> <BR>With a nod, Midnight leads her out of the Inn, through the door. He tries to squelch the feeling that this girl was going to end up in a collar no matter what he did, and curses silently, as they head into town, down the main road… <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		 <BR> <BR>Zaret watches the hunter and the winged angel walk out of the Inn with something bordering on fury. No! She is mine! He thinks angrily to himself. Stealthily, he stands from his table, dropping a measly copper for the ale, and slides out of the Inn, and starts following Seliah and Midnight.  <BR> <BR>Impatiently, he waits for the hunter to leave her alone, and as each hour passes, he grows more and more furious. Curse the man, wasn’t he going to leave her somewhere he felt safe that she’d have a room for the night? Or had the fool decided to stay with her? As the angel and the hunter enter the Moonlight Inn, Zaret curses softly again, and follows behind them a discreet distance, quickly ducking behind a door as the silver-winged angel turned around, eyes narrowed, obviously searching for something. <BR> <BR>He saw her touch a small hand to the big hunter’s arm, and say something to him. The hunter nodded, and his eyes raked over the area behind the two. Zaret could almost feel the knife-point in his gut. Forcing calm onto himself, the slaver waited patiently, until the hunter and the angel moved further into the Inn. <BR> <BR>Then, once they had gone up the stairs to the rooms on the second floor of the Inn, Zaret approached the bartender, who was wiping down the surface of the bar top. The man looked up at the slaver’s approach, quickly assessing him in a practiced look, and set his towel down. <BR> <BR>“What can I get you?” <BR> <BR>“An ale, and a room.” Zaret said simply. <BR> <BR>“The ale I can give you, but we don’t house slavers in here.”  <BR> <BR>“I said…an ale and a room.” He growled, eyeing the bartender.  <BR> <BR>The man just shook his head. “I can’t do that, M’lord. Owner’s rule. We don’t rent rooms to slavers. You can talk to him, but I’m not giving you a room.” <BR> <BR>“Fine.” Zaret muttered. “Just the ale, then. And make it fast.” He slapped several gold coins down on the counter, and dropped into a stool, with arms folded. <BR> <BR>The tender nodded, and produced a mug of the frothy liquid, scooping the coins into a money pouch without another word, eyeing Zaret much too closely for the slaver’s comfort. Quickly downing the ale, Zaret set the mug down on the wooden counter, and moved down the length of the bar, towards the stairs.  <BR> <BR>Before the tender could protest, he bolted up the stairs, and into the nearest room, just in time to see Midnight take up a position outside the third door on the left of the hallway. Grumbling to himself, Zaret shook his head, and sighed. This was going to be difficult…but worth it. The angel would bring in a lot of gold. And Orion had specifically asked for a winged one...
