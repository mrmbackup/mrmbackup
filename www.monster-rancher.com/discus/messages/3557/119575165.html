 The next few days were treacherous for X and his crew. Swaps, bogs, and man- eating creatures slowed them down at every turn on their way to the next major city. <BR> <BR>“This is taking forever, X. We have to get rid of some of your group or we’ll never get anything done,” said Garrett.  <BR> <BR>“I know. I was hoping we could just leave them in the care of a hospitable rancher and go on with Pressure, Blaze, Amazon, Inferno, Scythe, and Slash. The only problem is, we have to get TO the <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> town first,” he huffed, as a snake met it’s end on his blade. <BR> <BR>“Well, they could always stay at my ranch. It’s about 2 miles east of us right now.” <BR> <BR>X turned. “You have a ranch? You didn’t tell us? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!” <BR> <BR>Garrett turned red. “Well, I didn’t know you wanted to drop of these monsters..” <BR> <BR>X stared up at Garrett’s mansion. It was a 5 story tall house with ornate carvings on the exterior.  <BR> <BR>Inside, the halls ere lined with regal statues and personal servants ran around trying to get things ready to accommodate the new load of monsters. X whistled.  <BR> <BR>“Well, I had to do something with my winnings, didn’t I?” said Garrett. <BR> <BR>X fell back to his waiting group. He told the monsters of the plan. Although many wanted to come, they knew that they were just bogging the group down. As soon as the extra monsters got settled in their new quarters, X told Garrett, “Let’s go.” <BR> <BR>The now small group of hardened monsters headed back out. They reached the next town quickly. <BR> <BR>Standing on a hill, the group surveyed the town. What they saw horrified them. <BR> <BR>Even from a distance, they could see the various bodies that littered the streets. Houses were on fire. “What happened?” exclaimed Amazon. No one answered.  <BR> <BR>The team proceeded into town. It was worse than they thought. Heads on stakes lined the street, while various body parts littered the sidewalks. Nearing the center of the town, they heard a commotion.  <BR> <BR>Rushing forward, hoping that somebody was alive, they identified from the shouts and screams that a battle was going on. Unfortunately, it seemed there were no humans fighting.  <BR> <BR>As they turned around the corner, a Terrordog slammed into building with such force that the building collapsed. Pressure looked toward the cause and shouted, “Quick, we have to help!” <BR> <BR>Everyone turned their heads to see a tall, bulky Antlan &#40;by Antlan standards, in other words, about the size of a Golem’s lower leg&#41; flinging around a huge crowd of Tigers, Golems, Durahans, and Dragons. What most interested everyone though, was the Antlan. Instead of the normal one crescent crown, he had one on his head, two half crescent blades hanging from his hips that looked like daggers, and a crescent strapped across his back with a sting attached to both ends that was then drawn taut &#40;a bow&#41;, and a case of arrows made from crescent pieces strapped across his back. And he was fighting the enemy with a golden sword. “Definitely a warrior,” thought X. <BR> <BR>“Stay here,” X said to Garrett. He then turned to the rest of his team. “Go,” was all he had to say. <BR> <BR>Immediately they rushed into battle.  <BR> <BR>Enemy alarms sounded as the seven rushed forward. As Amazon and Blaze took flight, all of the Dragons rose to intercept them. Six Golems squared off against Pressure. Inferno and Slash teamed up to fight against the remaining Golems. X and Scythe dodged countless attacks by the tigers then retaliated.  They recognized the strength of these new opponents and mustered forced big enough to put them down. Or so they thought. <BR> <BR>As the seven decimated the outer wall, the inner mass still surged against the Antlan. X recognized he couldn’t fight forever and was tiring. “We need to hurry!”  <BR> <BR>But nobody could do anything. The enemy simply outnumbered them too much. Although they could have destroyed the enemy in one quick sweep, there was too much danger in hitting one another. After all, even if the enemy wasn’t highly trained, they could still put up a fight.  <BR> <BR>Suddenly, Blaze veered off and Amazon dropped out of a dogfight like a torpedo, going toward the Antlan in a steep dive. Inferno looked up and realized what they were doing. “RUN!” he yelled. <BR> <BR>Without questioning him, all five ran. Slash picked up Garrett on the way out. <BR> <BR>The pixie landed right next to the Antlan. “TAKE COVER!” she yelled over the din of the battle.  <BR> <BR>Running around in swift circles through the mass of enemy fighters, she purposely made sure to get lightly cut by each and every one. Dashing out of the circle, a bruised and battered mess, she turned around. “LIFE STEAL!” <BR> <BR>At once her purpose became apparent. Beams of light green energy snaked throughout the enemy, touching every single one of them. As the beams touched them, they roared in pain and looked up toward the sky as their life energy rose out of them and then slammed into the pixie.  <BR> <BR>The army collapsed one after the other until everyone was gone. Except the Antlan, who was standing in the middle of the entire mess, smiling.  <BR> <BR>It began to rain. The water mixed with the blood on the streets. <BR> <BR>It turned red. Then, when the blood was gone, it stopped. Night fell. <BR> <BR>The water flowed over the streets as the Antlan and the pixie met the rest of the team outside of town. It all flowed as a collective stream toward the center square. Flowing into the town fountain, defying all laws of gravity, it swirled in the water and then formed into a compact red sphere. A dark figure rose out of the water, holding the sphere in his hand. He watched the zan’s team walk off. “A victory, you have won, but soon you will wonder if it was a victory at all. You have incurred my wrath, and now, you shall feel it.” <BR> <BR>The red sphere of water formed into an eagle and flew off into the night.

 I didn&#39;t really enjoy this chapter as much as the last. The action is very bland and vague; being a description addict I found it hard to sink my teeth into. <BR> <BR>As far as you’re basic writing goes, excellent work. I like the look and feel of your Antlon, and it is traits like these that can define character. Wish more personality had been presented with him, if not some &#40;no matter how little&#41; conversation. <BR> <BR>Of course, the &#39;city walls&#39; jumped out of nowhere. Didn&#39;t even visualize walls at the beginning, then boom, there they were. <BR> <BR>And like I said last chapter, your count is now 1 Zan, 2 Dragon, 1 Pixie, 1 Golem, 1 Joker, 1 Pheonix, and 1 Antlon. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad you included one monster that isn&#39;t cliché, but I&#39;d like to see more variety still. Not even main party roles, but just add something new and unusual into the sidelines &#40;I.E. random kills&#41;. But remember, always room for more villins. <BR> <BR>Regardless of my gripes, I can&#39;t dance my words around the phenomenal leaps and bounds you are improving by. If you stick with it, I can guarantee that eventually &#40;it may take months, or years&#41; your talent will hone into something formidable to the finest authors of this site. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been writing in the MR universe since Junior High, when it was still at B. Campbell&#39;s board. When we moved over here, I stuck with it. So, in the 7-8 years I&#39;ve been involved here, I constantly improved, much like many of the young writers here have and continue to do. <BR> <BR>So, it may take a while to find your inner poet, but everyone who ever had the balls to post a story on here, felt some caliber of worth to it, and thus, will inherently have the dedication to make it something powerful. <BR> <BR>Again, in simple terms: This is good stuff, and I happily await the next chapter.
