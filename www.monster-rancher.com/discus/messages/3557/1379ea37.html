Moo stood in front of a mirror in his study.  A glass of red wine sat in his right hand.  He slowly sloshed the liquid in the glass. <BR><I>&#34;So.  Another dares to challenge me.&#34;</I> <BR>The glass in his hand started to vibrate, then shattered.  The mirror exploded into small glass fragments as invisible energies blasted it.   <BR><I>&#34;The fools have no idea who they&#39;re toying with.  I think it&#39;s time they finally saw the truth...&#34;</I> <BR>Moo turned, his cape lighty brushing the ground.  He walked from his study into the library.  He faced a wall and his eyes glowed.  It slowly opened up into a secret room, adorned with candles and evil artifacts.  A pool of quicksilver sat in the middle of the floor.  Walked over to the pool and waved his hand over it.  The liquid metal shimmered and a face appeared in it.  It was the image of Doran, a loyal human follower that owned a colliseum in the city of Kisa. <BR>&#34;Doran.&#34; <BR>Doran bowed his head in the traditional greeting Moo&#39;s followers gave their master. <BR>&#34;Master Moo..to what do I owe this visit from my master?&#34; <BR>&#34;Has Pyre and Yorin done their duty, Doran?&#34; <BR>Doran bowed again. <BR>&#34;Yes Master...Thank you.  The girl has died, and the monster will be sent to the market holding area...&#34; <BR>Moo smiled.  The plan was working rather splendedly...soon he will have a powerful new soldier, if things worked out right.  Pyre the Dragon and Yorin the Reaper has done well.  He should reward them for their work. <BR>&#34;Doran.  How long will it take for the monster to get into your care?&#34; <BR>&#34;Please be patient, Master Moo...any day now...&#34; <BR>Moo&#39;s eyes glowed red. <BR>&#34;You dare to order me?!&#34; <BR>Doran shivered. <BR>&#34;Of course not Master Moo!  Please forgive me!&#34; <BR>Doran&#39;s head lowered in reverence. <BR>&#34;No matter.  Make sure you are able to do this right, Doran, if you value your life.&#34; <BR>The image on the mercury vanished.  Moo smiled, pleased at how everything was going.  New soldiers were being made at a record pace, and his hold throughout the lands was getting stronger every day. <BR>&#34;But that damn Leo and his group.&#34; <BR>Moo&#39;s eyes glowed blue, and the mercury showed an image of Rys and his group, walking through the woods.  They were close to the town of Kisa..what a coincidence.  This could work out better than he hoped. <BR>&#34;Open up space and time, this spell is my rhyme.  Take from another plane, an Omega to help my reign.&#34; <BR>The mercury slowly started to rise, and moved over the pool to hover over the ground.  It slowly took the form of an Omega.  It&#39;s large eye illuminated to life.  It spoke in a slightly loud robotic voice. <BR>&#34;Destructive Effigy of Ancient civil Nations..DEAN...activated.  All systems functioning.  Programmer recognised as MOO.  Awaiting instructions.&#34; <BR>Moo had the image of Rys and group appear in the mercury pool. <BR>&#34;You are to terminate these monsters with utmost haste and precision.&#34; <BR>The Omega scans the images of Rys, Lorin, Rorik, and Silve into his memory banks.  <BR>&#34;Objective recieved.  Destroy and eliminate targets.&#34; <BR>The Omega started to shimmer, and his form started to slim into a thin vertical line.  It then vanished.  Moo turned on his heel and walked away to get another glass of blood wine.
