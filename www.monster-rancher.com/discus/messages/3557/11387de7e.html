 Hullo!^_^ I came back! Although I never really went anywhere….nuts. Well, anyway, here’s the next part. Hope you guys enjoy. <BR> <BR>Earlier today, I was challenged to a fight by this stranger with his Centaur, Charles. I agreed to the fight and now it’s probably too late to back out. Sure, I would love for Jamaru to train during battle, but the way that the stranger’s Centaur was staring at Jamaru’s pendant….. That made me a little nervous. <BR> <BR>I haven’t really considered Jamaru’s pendant to be that important. Maybe a symbol of individually of some sort. Or maybe an accessory that was given to him by his previous trainer. Yeah, that’s right, I never gave him the pendant. Someone else did. As much as I would love to meet this ‘giver of the pendant’ guy, I don’t really have the time. Besides, whenever I mention about the pendant, Jamaru would always change the subject. <BR> <BR>My train of thought was suddenly disturbed by a sudden CRASH! I quickly turned my attention to the battle, only to find Jamaru rammed into a tree by Charles. He backed up a little, only to give Jamaru some breathing space. But to the Centaur’s surprise, Jamaru quickly pounced on him, driving him back into the middle of the invisible battle ring. Jamaru was about to go for a quick bite at one of Charles’s legs, but soon enough that Charles had a chance to grab one of Jamaru’s hind legs. He then started to swing Jamaru around like he was a sack of potatoes. <BR> <BR>A few grunts from Charles and with that, flicked Jamaru back at the same tree that he was rammed into. I felt hopeless as I watched my Tiger, my friend, getting beaten to a bloody pulp. I felt like I just wanted to throw myself into the fight, but I’d just get in the way. Charles walked over slowly to the beaten-up Jamaru, but to his surprise, Jamaru, quickly got up again and charged up his horns with electricity. Charles was about to punch him in the chest, when suddenly he did completely the opposite: he missed completely! <BR> <BR>“Wha-?” I looked over to the stranger, who was now baffled at what his monster has done. It was either my imagination, or it was that I think Charles missed on purpose. That made me curious….in an odd sort of way…… <BR> <BR>I turned my attention back to the fight, but soon discovered that it was all over: Jamaru lying on the grass unconscious with Charles standing by his body, still staring at the pendant. Suddenly, Charles bent down and actually held the pendant in his hands! Normally, if Jamaru was awake, I’m sure that at that moment, Charles would be one dead Centaur. Odd as it may seem, Charles eyes widen with shock. At that moment, the stranger snapped his fingers. A few moments passed. At long last, Charles finally got up, picked up Jamaru, walked over to me, handed me Jamaru, then galloped over to his master. <BR> <BR>I was in a curious state at that time, but then I finally turned my attention down to Jamaru. My god, he was in bad shape, that he was. Blood, bruises, scratches, nicks, cuts and swells filled his body. But oddly enough, nothing, absolutely nothing was near the pendant. Nope. No blood, bruises or cuts what-so-ever.  <BR> <BR>“Hey! Little girl!” suddenly hearing these words, I was tweaked. <BR> <BR>“I’m not little, you stupid little…” I was cut short by…well…whatever it was. I could now actually see the stranger’s face now, on account of that he was in the shadows this whole time. He had curly brown hair and was some what tall. I could see a sly little smile on his face, too. <BR> <BR>“Well, I do say, that was quite fun. I never got a hold of your name, by the way.” <BR> <BR>I was silent for a moment, but then finally found my manners. “The name’s Cleo Makaru. I never caught your name, either. Who are you?” <BR> <BR>“Oh, I never told you? I’m terribly sorry. I’m James Emperium. It was a pleasure to meet you, Cleo. I hope that one day, we’ll meet again and then, we’ll duel yet again. Until then, tah – tah!” And there he went, with Charles, over the grassy plains. I stood silent for a moment, still staring at the spot that James stood a minute ago. My trance was broken by muffled sounds coming from Jamaru. He, too, was looking at the same place I was. He seemed to be interested about something. I’m not sure what, but now would’ve been a perfect time  to give Jamaru a little lecture . . . <BR> <BR>“See? Charles was a normal centaur, and he still kicked your butt! Still think monsters with the same sub type are weak?” This strongly got Jamaru’s attention. <BR> <BR>“Oh, I see! You’re using that ‘persuasion’ stuff on me, ain’t ya? Well, it’s not gonna work, Missy! You can tell me all you want, but I still think it makes you stronger.” I was surprised to see Jamaru jump down from my arms and look back at me. “I will get stronger, Cleo. Until I can prove to you that I can be something other than a normal Tiger!” so off he went, to go do some more training. <BR> <BR>I was shocked at how Jamaru said those few words….but yet, in a strange way, had faith for him. I didn’t know at that time if he knew he was seriously injured, but I think the only thing he had left in his mind was to impress me…..or win the tournament. Which ever one it was, I was still proud of him. <BR> <BR>“Jamaru….” I mumbled to myself silently. “I know you can do this. I just wish you’d change your mind about your sub – type…..” And so I went to join him in his training. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>So wadda think? Kinda cheesy, I know, so comments and helpful tips would be appreciated. Thanx!:P
