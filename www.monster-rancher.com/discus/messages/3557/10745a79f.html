 It was odd, very odd. I had only heard of twin monsters in fables and      stories, and they had been the same breed. These two were different breeds, VERY different breeds. I did not think that this was possible. “Whoa! Those two are an Ogyo and a Gitan,” the Shrine Keeper said from behind me. “But, I didn’t know that these breeds existed in this part of the continent. Where did you say you got this disc?” He seemed intrigued, as he was speaking to me civilly, which was very odd for him. <BR> <BR>I’d have to say that I was very intrigued myself. The Gitan, as he called it, looked like a little demon, but rabbit like. The body was round and small, with small, stubby arms and legs. In one hand it held a small pitchfork. It was purple and black, and long, fat ears with pinchers on the end, and it had a long fat tail with a point on the end. The Ogyo was a petite, pink fish, with two yellow frills; one on each side of the head. In the middle of the head was a long, pink, heart shaped thing. It had these deep, blue eyes that when you stared into them, you could get lost forever. <BR> <BR>“Where did you say you got this disc?” Al seemed seemed a bit peeved this time. His voice woke me out of my trance. “Uhhh…. I don’t really know,” I replied, “a good friend gave it to me.” <BR>  <BR>“Ok…. well then,” he didn’t seem like he believed me. “You have to give them a name.” I totally forgot about that. For some odd reason it took me a while to create a name for this odd duo. I ended up using the first names that came to my head. <BR> <BR>“Alright, I’ll name the Gitan, Devlin and the Ogyo, Stefioni.” I know, I know, odd names, but go with it. Going back to the way he always acted, the Shrine keeper began to write down the names on the registration form. He gave me the slip, and I was on my way. <BR> <BR> <BR>	 <BR>Sorry this ones a bit short. It sort of needs to be.
