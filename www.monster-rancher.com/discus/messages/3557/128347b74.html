 O.K this is based on my earlier idea on Lisa&#39;s thread. Please tell me if you like it; its mr2 orientated. <BR> <BR>Btw, Im from the UK so you might find words which arent used much in America. <BR> <BR>It was dawn. Redge was fully dressed and ready to embark on his quset of vengence. At seventeen, he was a tall young man and a skilled scientist, having worked with his father as a lab apprentice for five years. <BR>But no more than a week ago, Redge&#39;s father, the famous Dadgius Mor, was murded by the infamous King Ape, dominator of the Parepare jungle. Until now, King Ape was a myth, an old wives tale to scare disobediant children. Redge new this was false, having seen his father brutally murdered by the evil ape. <BR> <BR>Following the defeat of Moo, there were several rebellions from his followers, monsters raised by cruel and harsh means. Many monsters returned to good nature upon Moo&#39;s death, but evil still lingered in the monster ranching world. King Ape became the leader of a small faction of dark monsters in the Parepare jungle, seeking revenge. One night, they ambushed the Town. Dadgius Mor was murdered in his own home, Redge was forced to watch as King Ape lifted him off his feet and hurled him through the window. Redge escaped with his life, yet he was doomed to eternal regret. Only by destroying the feared King Ape, could he redeem himself. <BR> <BR>Redge strolled to the remains of a burnt down shrine clutching a Disc Stone at his side. <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll need a companion if I&#39;m to defeat King Ape,&#34; he said to himself, grimly. Placing the Stone at the Shrine Altar, he screamed at the top of his voice: &#34;UNLOCK!!&#34; <BR> <BR>Redge was engulfed in a bright blue light, his hands were shaking, slowly his whole body began to vibrate with the force. Despite being a master of freezing, combining and analyzing monsters, he had never actually reproduced a monster from a Disc Stone. Finally he was thrown backwards, and he found himself staring into the eyes of a... <BR> <BR>...Joker!! A baby Joker. Redge cursed himself. He knew as well as any that Joker was an evil breed of monster, who would not help him on his quest. Only a highly skilled monster breeder would be able to control such a monster. <BR>&#34;Please.. you must help me..&#34; Redge said feebly, but Joker wasn&#39;t in the mood for conversation. Instead he let out a chilling laugh and swung his huge scythe at Redge&#39;s defenceless body. <BR>&#34;Heeelp!!&#34; He cried, rolling sideways to avoid the blow. The sythe missed by an inch, Redge felt his rapidly pulsating heart increase in velocity. What would a master trainer do? Redge drew himself to his full height and bellowed: <BR>&#34;You will obey me NOW!!&#34; <BR>Joker sneered, but withdrew his assault. <BR>&#34;That was my only Disc Stone,&#34; Redge began, trying to keep his voice low and imperious, &#34;So your going to help me whether you like it or not!&#34; <BR>Joker laughed a soft angry laugh. Reluctantly he swooped over to Redge&#39;s side. <BR> <BR>And so they set off towards the first stage of their journey: crossing the Mandy Desert-together, Redge and Joker. <BR> <BR>O.K I&#39;ll do a bit more later, tell me if you like it! <BR> <BR>Nimrook

 Erm.. I know this isnt short fiction but I figured it wasnt much of an epic. Anyway... <BR> <BR>REDGE AND JOKER- PART II <BR> <BR>The Mandy Desert. One of the largest and most perilous areas in the world. Redge and Joker would be crossing it... alone. <BR>&#34;We should be well rested before beginning our journey,&#34; said Redge sagely. Fortunately there was a small village near the border, and Redge quickly found an inn. <BR> <BR>They approached the front door, and Redge knocked nervously on the old, wooden frame. After waiting for a coule of minutes, Joker gave a short laugh as if to say: &#34;There&#39;s no one at home- I&#39;ll be leaving now!&#34; Sure enough, Joker was beginning to glide away from his new master. <BR>&#34;Wait!!&#34; Shouted Redge, and vigourously knocked harder, angry to lose faith in his first monster. Finally the door opened and an old man apperared, curiously eyeing the the young lad and the drifting Joker. <BR>&#34;Hello, my name is Redge, this is MY monster. We&#39;d like to stay the night, please.&#34; <BR>&#34;Why, certainly young master, follow me.&#34; <BR> <BR>After dragging the reluctant Joker to the stables, Redge settled down for a good nights sleep. He wished so dearly that his wonderful father Dadgius Mor was still alive, and his mother, who died giving birth to him. She was an assistant trainer, Coltia. Apparently she was very beautful. <BR> <BR>Redge was woken up by the sound of screaming. <BR>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; He mumbled dozily. <BR>&#34;Your monster has escaped!!&#34; Shouted the innkeeper. Redge was rushed down to the stables, which had been hacked to smitherines by a gigantic scythe. No Joker. <BR>&#34;<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>, I knew this would happen,&#34; said Redge, furiously. <BR>&#34;That&#39;s not the worst of it,&#34; the innkeeper replied grimly. He pointed to a fresh trail of blood. <BR>&#34;What have I done?&#34; Wailed Redge. <BR>&#34;Please stop it before it kills anyone else.&#34; <BR> <BR>Redge followed the trail of blood, there was a thumping senation in his head, the scent of death filled the air. Two, three, four lifeless bodies lay scattered among the path of red. Eventually the trail wore thin, Redge scanned the area for any signs of Joker. At last he heard a faint cackle in the distance, and sprang towards the direction of the voice. <BR> <BR>Joker was unconcious, lying in front of a full grown, angry Mocchi. The Mocchi&#39;s master was nearby, he had waxed blonde hair and a posh red suit. <BR>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Demanded Redge. <BR>&#34;The Joker is yours, correct? My name is Redrorick, but you can call me Red. I had Lamsweet here K.O your monster &#39;coz he was trying to kill me.&#34; <BR>Redge began to feel calmer, Red&#39;s relaxed voice was quite soothing. <BR>&#34;Where are you off to anyway? This is the border of the Mandy Desert, y&#39;know.&#34; <BR>&#34;I know. I&#39;m crossing it,&#34; said Redge, simply. <BR> <BR>It was night, Redge, Joker, Red and Lamsweet where all settled around a blazing campfire. <BR>&#34;I named this monster after my father&#39;s monster,&#34; said Red indicating Lamsweet. <BR>&#34;What is your monster&#39;s name?&#34; <BR>Redge shrugged. Red looked appauled. <BR>&#34;You&#39;ve gotta give your monster a name, or it wont like you. Huh?&#34; <BR>&#34;Joker then. I just call it Joker.&#34; <BR>&#34;Alright then. Joker it is. By the way, have you heard of Sniper?&#34; Asked Red. <BR>&#34;No why?&#34; <BR>&#34;He&#39;s a Centaur. As soon as you set foot in the Mandy desert, he&#39;s spotted you, and he&#39;ll follow you all the way across and you&#39;ll never see him once- that is, unless he decides to make his presence known to ya. Take it from me kid, if your crossin&#39; that desert, you&#39;ll need me and Lamsweet as your backup.&#34; <BR>Redge was thrilled! He and Joker wouldnt be alone after all. <BR> <BR> <BR>That&#39;s it for now.. hmmm, not as good as I hoped. Tell me if its ok or rubbish, <BR> <BR>Nimrook
