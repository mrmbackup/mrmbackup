<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:Daeore@hotmail.com>Daeore Dermegil</A></B> on <B>Tuesday, January 28, 2003 - 05:40 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 &#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>A week passed.  Durahan, Sarah, Angel and I had said nothing more about the book, yet we checked on it every day.  I had taught everything there was to know about this shrine, and all that was needed now, was a disk. <BR> <BR>The end of this week, we had our chance.  A rather shady individual arrived at the entrance to the shrine, holding a disk.  Durahan, dutiful as ever, led the man into the main shrine, where Sarah and I played chess on the administrative table. <BR> <BR>He introduced himself as Geo.  Dressed in black and green in a not quite dignified way, he seemed a bit of a nervous fellow.  He handed me the disk, and an official monster trainer card, &#40;FIMBA, rancher grade four&#41;, and told us that he was going to be the town&#39;s official rancher.  Happy that the burden was not only lifted off of me, but that we finally had a disk for Sarah to make her shrine keeper&#39;s debut. <BR> <BR>So, leaning against the desk, I watched as Sarah stepped upon the altar, and placed the disk in the little depression.  Geo watched as she started to chant the words to unlock the disk, the shrine giving off that green glow. <BR> <BR>Suddenly, the disk stopped spinning, and &#39;She&#39; appeared.  The shrine maiden&#39;s ghost appeared between Sarah and the disk.  Looking first at Sarah, then Geo, &#40;who looked like he was about to have a heart attack, his face was so pale&#41; then myself.  &#39;Who is this, to use the shrine?&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;My apprentice.  The time of my departure is getting closer.  I must train a replacement.&#39;  I found myself replying, despite a small tickle of &#39;something not right&#39; in the back of my head. <BR> <BR>The ghost nodded.  &#39;She has the power.  But, she knows.  She knows, and thus cannot stay here.  You must take the book, her, Angel and Durahan.&#39;  Geo looked confused as the ghost spoke to me.  &#39;Miki Rudora.  You must not leave your companions behind.&#39; <BR> <BR>I was looking at the ghost, my full attention on her.  So I didn&#39;t notice Geo&#39;s look of recognition at the mention of my real name.  &#39;But, what of the shrine?  It would be...&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;Worry not.&#39;  The ghost looked at Sarah, &#39;I am sorry, but you cannot stay here.  But I will remain vigilant over the shrine.  My half century of slumber, had granted me small power over this shrine, my resting place. <BR> <BR>Geo had gone back to his fearful look when I looked over at him.  &#39;Thank you, Shrine Maiden.  Could you grant this man, Geo, his monster?&#39; <BR> <BR>With a ghostly laugh, the spirit spiraled into nothingness, and the disk resumed spinning.  Sarah repeated the chant, and slowly the disk vanished, being replaced by a Tiger.  Growling slightly and shaking out its white and blue fur, it bristled impressively, before settling down and scratching it&#39;s ear with a hind paw. <BR> <BR>&#39;Congratulations Geo.  You have a Tiger.&#39;  Sarah said, waving a hand for the Tiger to step off the shrine, and go to Geo, who had stopped looking like he might soil himself, and more like a proud new monster rancher. <BR> <BR>&#39;Thank you, your eminence, he said to Sarah as he scratched behind the Tiger&#39;s ear, making it almost purr. <BR> <BR>&#39;Now if you&#39;ll just sign the registration forms...  Here, here, and here.&#39;  I said, motioning to an official looking paper on the desk. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>The Mayor, after a brief talk, an introduction to the spirituous Shrine Maiden, and a shot of a strong mango based alcohol, things were more or less squared away.  He was disappointed that I planned to leave almost four months ahead of schedule, and that Sarah would be coming with us too.  But &#39;Who am I to argue with a ghost?&#39; Was his reply to that. <BR> <BR>I still ran the shrine for another week while Sarah shopped for supplies and hired a messenger to take a note to her father.  Geo returned once for advice on his Tiger, &#40;you don&#39;t give him a chew toy made of wood.  Ask the smith for something a little more durable.&#41;  Doctor Percius came by and gave us his best wishes too, giving me an amazingly well made compass as a parting gift.  Durahan had taken the book out of its hiding spot, and had it in his backpack.  After he had done that, he refused &#40;politely but stubbornly&#41; to take the pack off.  Angel was her helpful self, and managed our money very well.  In the eight odd months I had been here, we had spent very little of our already small amount of money, and only the money Sarah had brought with her enabled us to get all the supplies we would need on our trek. <BR> <BR>Looking back on this.  I should have asked for some sort of pay for being the shrine keeper.  Oh well. <BR> <BR>We had all the basics.  Food, water, portable shelter for four, my bow and arrows in case the opportunity to hunt came along, the shiny new compass, clothes and last but not least...  The disk shard. <BR> <BR>Angel, despite her unwillingness to go, made sure I packed it along with the book, in Durahan&#39;s pack.  Patting her on the head, I gave her a smile, and asked her to make sure we had everything. <BR> <BR>Sarah was inside the shrine when we made the last check and shouldered our burdens.  Durahan carried Sarah&#39;s pack, and we started to head out, under the afternoon sun. <BR> <BR>Then we heard Sarah scream. <BR> <BR>It was the kind of scream you get when you sneak up behind some body, and forget to cover their mouth when you are holding something sharp to their back.  The three of us ran towards the shrine, heading to the altar room.  I had somewhere along the line strung my bow and readied an arrow, and as we entered the shrine, I felt my blood turn to ice. <BR> <BR>I wanted, more than anything in the world, to fire that arrow.  Sarah was being held by Geo.  Arm behind her back, and hand over her mouth, she could do little but mumble and struggle feebly.  But it wasn&#39;t Geo who had me wishing violence, it was my father&#39;s old assistant, standing next to him.  He had a look of triumph on his thin seedy looking face as I entered, with Angel behind me. <BR> <BR>&#39;Good.  She did scream loud enough.&#39;  He started, running a finger down the side of Sarah&#39;s cheek.  &#39;Miki, so good of you to come to her aid.  And Angel, so glad you haven&#39;t died yet.&#39;  His voice was arrogant, and dripping with sarcasm. <BR> <BR>Angel made a huff noise, crossing her arms and turning her head away, chin pointed upwards.  Durahan set Sarah&#39;s pack down and was already brandishing his great sword.  I had pulled the string on my bow back, but I kept my aim lowered. <BR> <BR>&#39;What do you want, you...&#39;  I also wanted to swear, a lot, at this man, but my dad&#39;s lessons on manners prevented me from doing so. <BR> <BR>&#39;Angel, the disk fragment, and for you to forget about me.  And call off your tin man.&#39;  He said, waving a hand, &#39;Or I&#39;ll get Geo here to snap Sarah&#39;s pretty little neck.  I know how much of a friend she is to you.  I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t like to have her dead.&#39;  He smiled a sick minded smile, &#39;Friends and family are so precious, it would be a shame to lose more than you have already.&#39; <BR> <BR>I was just about to lower my bow and relax my draw, when the shrine throbbed with that deep underground heartbeat, and behind Geo the shrine maiden&#39;s ghost appeared, her elegant features drawn up in rage, &#39;SACRILEGE!&#39;  She screamed, an otherworldly echo in her voice. <BR> <BR>Both Geo and my father&#39;s ex-assistant turned, startled at the voice.  Sarah used this instant to bite Geo&#39;s finger, hard, and elbow him in the gut.  Free of his grasp she ran toward me.  I had also used that moment to raise my bow and aim.  &#39;Geo you idiot!  Get her!&#39;  The ex-assistant yelled.  He was also about to give chase when he noticed I was pointing my arrow at him. <BR> <BR>He had time to just turn his head away.  And instead of his mouth, the broad headed arrow cut deeply into his cheek, and neatly snipped off the lobe of his right ear.  Geo had ducked when he saw me aim, and Sarah was clear to reach us.  A wave of power pulsed from the angry ghost as the ex-assistant fell to the ground screaming in pain, clutching his cheek.  &#39;Miki!  Run!  I will take care of this...  Insect!&#39; <BR> <BR>Durahan picked up Sarah&#39;s pack, Angel led Sarah away down the hall, and I followed behind, getting a look from the shrine maiden when I raised my bow again.  &#39;Enough blood has been shed here.  Go.  Now.&#39;  She said to my back, as I ran with her third word. <BR> <BR>Screams of the two in the shrine followed us out.  At the entrance of the shrine, Geo&#39;s Tiger was there, waiting with a growl.  Durahan, who was in the lead, simply brought the pommel of his sword down over the top of its head as the Tiger leapt at him.  The limp body of the Tiger sailed into the shrines entranceway as the four of us left. <BR> <BR>And under the midday sun, we left the once sleepy town I had arrived at eight months before.  Faintly, as we crashed into the forest north of the shrine, we heard more screaming as my fathers ex-assistant and Geo ran away from the shrine. <BR> <BR>We didn&#39;t stop running for about an hour.  Durahan used his armored body and sharp sword to hack a trail for the rest of us.  Thankfully the shoes Angel was given were tough, as she couldn&#39;t fly over the rough ground we ran over. <BR> <BR>Soon, the dense tropical forest started to thin a little.  And with that, we found a clearing and stopped to rest.  Angel panted, out of breath.  Durahan supported her gently, seemingly unfazed by the run.  Sarah was also a little out of breath, and we leaned on each other for support. <BR> <BR>&#39;What happened?&#39;  I asked Sarah as I caught my breath and checked my pack. <BR> <BR>&#39;I was just minding the desk, when Geo arrived in the altar room.  He had a disk under his arm, and wanted me to unlock it for him.  I accepted the disk and turned away, when he grabbed me.  I dropped the disk and screamed.&#39;  Sarah shivered slightly, &#39;that&#39;s when that...  Traitor to your father stepped into the room and said &#39;now we wait.&#39; <BR> <BR>Part way through the story, I had clenched my hands into angry fists, caught myself doing it, and tried to relax.  Durahan put his big cold hand on my shoulder and that seemed to clear my head, as it did those many months ago.  &#39;We have to get away.  The shrine maiden didn&#39;t kill them.&#39;  I said quietly, putting my bow away. <BR> <BR>&#39;Are you sure?&#39;  Sarah asked, accepting her pack from Durahan and shouldering it. <BR> <BR>&#39;She had said &#39;enough blood has been spilled,&#39; so I&#39;m sure all she has done is scare them off.  If they evade the Mayor, they will be after us for sure.&#39;  I replied, shrugging my shoulders to settle my pack firmly on my shoulders.  &#39;Angel.  It&#39;s time.  You have to point us in the right direction.&#39; <BR> <BR>I had stepped up to Angel, and put an gentle hand on her shoulder.  She again, looked like she wanted to be doing anything else, but this, and after a moment, pointed in a direction.  Pulling out the compass from a pocket, I checked it.  &#39;North.  Almost directly north.&#39; <BR> <BR>And so we started walking. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Okay...  I suddenly felt inspired, so I typed this up, and here you go. <BR> <BR>Should be about a week before I update again.  ^_^;;

 I don&#39;t mean to sound pushy or anything...but PLEASE hurry with the next story in the series! These stories are very well written, and I don&#39;t think I can wait much longer for the next &#34;episode&#34;. Keep up the good work!
