 Churchill woke up in a frightened state.  He searched frantically through the area, but Nimo was nowhere to be found.  He asked another elder, Gallu.  He was a strange old bajarl who was generally respected, if not a bit odd.  &#34;Nimo has gone to town,&#34; Gallu said in a calm, mystical voice &#34;He is either to be sold or combined, I do hope he&#39;ll be combined, he&#39;s a good friend of mine.&#34;  Combining was looked forward to by most every monster, it was considered to be an honor to have one&#39;s life-force transferred to a new monster.  When Jadzia came, Churchill was first in line this time.  After all of the tablets were handed out, she turned to all of the monsters.  &#34;My friends!  Our beloved Nimo&#39;s life force has been transferred into a new, young mock.  May his knowledge aid this child!&#34;  The whole stable cheered wildly.  Churchill turned his brown tablet over in his hand, then quickly swallowed i, satisfying his morning hunger. <BR>     Today was a recreation day, which was held every once in a while to give monsters a rest from their hard training.  Churchill was no longer interested in the games, he just stared at the tall windmill in front of him.  The blades churned slowly in the day&#39;s gentle breeze.  Why was Nimo being led here yesterday?  Why did WIllheim have such a sad look on his face if Nimo was to be combined?  Churchill looked around the ranch.  Everywhere, monsters conversed, slept, played, and ran in the warm sun, but none of this happiness could sway Churchhill&#39;s mind from the looming obelisk that lay ahead of him.  <BR>     Later that night, Churchill snuck out of his stable, and headed towards the now-dimly lighted windmill.  He was determined to find out what exactly went on in this tower....
