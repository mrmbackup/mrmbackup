 &#34;Come on!&#34; Axel bellowed impatiently. He was used to waiting on his companions, but this was ridiculous. <BR> <BR>Curso emerged first, greeted with nothing more than a sigh and a hard stare from Axel. He slowly draped his chain mail over his head with a slight, &#34;Give it a rest.&#34; <BR> <BR>    Axel merely crossed his massive arms over his chest, locking each hand behind his elbows. Axel was easily the largest member of their posse. Standing 6&#39;7&#34; at the age of 19, soon to be 20, he was indeed a sight. Mainly he barked loudly, but never really hurt anyone. He knew his strength. He had no hair, and one slight scar that ran across the right side of his head from a childhood injury. He wore leather straps of ebony tint, with several small spikes running across them. On each shoulder, one giant blade protruded. Not like a horn, more like a razor. It was thin, but more than able to cut through most anything. His family weapon was a large, two-handed sword. It was serrated on both sides, and was pure black. The hilt was red, with a red tassel dangling helplessly from it, almost swinging in a taunt at its opponents. <BR> <BR>    It would be important to note, this society prides itself on being able to protect one&#39;s self, family, and ideals. For such, each family chose a weapon to be wielded in generations, and trained their children to use the weapons as such. Of course, different families adopted different weapons, and thus unique styles and tactics. <BR> <BR>    Axel&#39;s tactics were quiet simple; parry until an opening presented itself. With such a large weapon, it was rather difficult to use much speed. However, with Axel&#39;s arms, one would only need one hit. He wore his family crest in the center of the straps, dead center of his chest. The maw of a grizzly, opened wide. <BR> <BR>    Curso was smallest of the group, but in no way intimidated by his childhood friend. Born a few months after Axel, he was coming to 20 this year as well. Curso&#39;s family weapon was the spear. One of few families that dared practice such masteries, as it was said to be demon&#39;s reference, similar to pitchforks. Of course, his tactic was to keep an enemy at bay for the most part. However, unlike most spear wielders, Curso had been trained by his father to use the spear in different ways. The spear&#39;s wasn&#39;t merely deadly on one end, the whole thing could be used. Not only this, but the spear can assist your body&#39;s attacks as well. His father innovated this style, his son perfected it. The family spear was silver, with a slight glossy shine to it. It was a smooth shaft, letting ones hands slip and slide over it. It had to sections with grips. This was to let the spear slide a short distance out of your hand,  <BR>and grasp the grips as you reached them. The end was filed to a fine point, and seemed to glisten more than the entire spear. Also used to blinds opponents when the light hit it right. He favored light chain mail, giving him adequate defense while ensuring enough mobility to have an offense to be reckoned with. His blonde hair seemed to rain down, strait as his spear. His bangs ran off his left side, just past the eye. Curso wore his family crest one his shoulders, it was of the deadly barracuda. <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t get cocky, small fry.&#34; Axel said in a low tone. <BR> <BR>Curso was at least a foot and a half shorter than Axel, but he glared up defiantly, &#34;Oh yeah?&#34; <BR> <BR>    Naturally, the two began laughing. Growing up together made them both look stupid in the other&#39;s eyes. Also, being sparing partners, they new what the other could do. <BR> <BR>Axel then yelled, &#34;God speed, Incognito, we gotta roll!&#34; <BR> <BR>    Incognito was a little bit shorter than Axel, but a good bit taller than Curso. He had light brown hair he kept trimmed in a crew cut manner. He wore all black robes, covering his hardened leather armor. He demanded maximum maneuverability with his weapons, twin hatchets. One was a dark blue, the other a violent red. The blue one had a bit of water in the handle, seen through the small glass portions of the hilt. The red one had the same design, except it was bright, fiery red, and had blood in it. Not just any water and blood now, it was holy water and demon blood. Supposedly, to his family, they represented the balance of all things, good and evil. Holy water symbolizes the need to protect, while the demonic blood represented how we must fight for things. He didn&#39;t say much, but he was a deadly advisory. His tactics were unsure, and if one word could define them, random. After a few minutes of fighting, he could have come up with an entirely new way to fight and defeat his opposition. His emblem resided on a bright blue bandana, being a coiled up black cobra. <BR> <BR>&#34;Lets go get my girl.&#34; Incognito said lightly. <BR> <BR>    Axel and Curso shrugged. Incognito had just turned 18, but they had been friends since they were little, and complimented each other&#39;s styles in a brawl. Incognito&#39;s &#39;girl&#39; had joined up with them a few years back, and felt like part of their family. She was the same age as Incognito. Anyone could see that them two would end up together. <BR> <BR>20 minutes later... <BR> <BR>    The trio strolled up to a humble cottage in the country. Since a great horse plague had occurred recently, steeds were in short supply, so they walked. <BR> <BR>    She was sitting on a fence post outside of the home. They approached from her left. Her left foot was propped up on the top wire of the fence, and her right hang down on the other side. It swayed lightly, almost with the wind. Her red hair flowed from under her green, robin hood hat. Her quiver hung loosely on her back, but upright enough that the arrows didn&#39;t fall out. She fiddled with her bow a bit, chiseling a deeper hitch in it with her knife. The bow was carved from Hopeless wood. It was called that from the loggers, who said it was hopeless to try and cut one down. Somehow, long ago, one of her ancestors made this one. The paltry knife was having somewhat of a problem cleaving the fine carved bow. <BR> <BR>    Most families train all of their children in the use of weapons, but name their eldest son for their champion, should a quarrel arise. These sons are usually trained more than the others. Her mother had died at an early age, and her father refused to marry anyone else. So, he trained her in the arts he himself was skilled with, being the  <BR>bow. He actually intended to name no champion of his home, until he saw how skilled she was with the bow and just how swift of a learner she was. When he first named her, the council laughed, and rejected it. When he demanded a test of her weapon skill at the age of 15, they agreed. Insisting that they needed the amusement, they proceeded to  <BR>throw three cans in the air. In each can she placed not one, but two arrows a piece before they hit the ground. The silence seemed to follow her and her father from the chamber followed shortly by quiet voices and hushed chatter. <BR> <BR>    She preferred hardened leather armor, like her love, for she also needed the edge of speed on opponents. Her symbol was placed on her belt, being a bright red phoenix, its wings raised in the air. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey guys, thought you would never show up!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Vertigo.&#34; Incognito said with a smile. <BR> <BR>&#34;You know,&#34; Curso said slowly as he moved one hand to his chin, &#34;Its amazing how she can talk so much and he so little.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hmmm.&#34; Axel assumed the same pose, &#34;Opposites attract.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Curso spoke again, &#34;Something about the quiet ones.&#34; <BR> <BR>    The largest and smallest members of their group in the same position was indeed affable, and they did laugh. Vertigo removed her hat and playfully swatted Curso on the head, who then proceeded to hide behind Axel. Axel raised his giant hands in a sarcastic plea for mercy before laughing himself. The four of them set off back to the town square. something big was happening tonight. Funny thing, nothing big EVER happens in Jenko Minito. <BR> <BR>In the Town Square...30 minutes later... <BR> <BR>    The square was actually quite a lovely place. Several benches set in a semicircle around the main podium along with the finely kept flowers and shrubs made it a beautiful place. People filed in and sat down. The four of them sat together, as always, as most friends do. Their families were there, but they didn&#39;t mind if they sat together. Only natural to enjoy your friends company. <BR> <BR>    Incognito noted a man as he entered. He wasn&#39;t a resident, and he wore the garments of a seasoned warrior of the king. Incognito didn&#39;t stare too long, as to be suspicious himself, but slowly slid into his seat beside Vertigo. To her right sat Axel, upright as always, arms crossed, and Curso, leaning on his spear, letting it flow harmlessly over his shoulder and into the air, blunt end firmly planted on the ground. <BR> <BR>&#34;Did you see that guy?&#34; Vertigo asked Cruso in a light whisper. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, looks like a sergeant for one of the legion cords, probably Wolf.&#34; Curso relied. <BR> <BR>    The king&#39;s army had three elite divisions, known as the Legions. Each legion was referred to as a Cord, something like Alpha group, Beta group, etc. The cords were Tiger, Wolf, and Dragon. Wolf operated more in the southern region, Jenko Minito was almost too far north for their jurisdiction. <BR> <BR>&#34;What makes you think Wolf?&#34; Axel asked as he tried to whisper with his booming voice. A child would think him God. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, I know for a fact that Tiger operates way North, so it can&#39;t be them. I also know that Dragon weapons are strictly axes, maces, and hammers. Check out his, its a Gore Baton.&#34; Curso said as he tossed his chin upwards towards the man, who was standing at full attention. <BR> <BR>    A Gore Baton is a weapon that requires both hands. It has two grips, but that is not due to its weight. Light enough to be wielded one handed, it takes two to properly control the sheer size of it. The handles are in the back, and in front of them is like a giant, jagged razor. Take your average large axe, remove the pole grip, extend the blade some three feet, install two grips in the back and serrate the edge. Proof! A Gore Baton. <BR> <BR>&#34;Didn&#39;t know the army legalized those.&#34; Incognito said slowly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Maybe they didn&#39;t yet,&#34; Curso spoke as he eyed the weapon, &#34;at least not for the general public.&#34; <BR> <BR>    Mayor Korelli had been mayor for as long as any of them had been alive. He was a good man, and did what he felt was best for the populous, not the government. this made him some rather nasty relations in the King&#39;s court. He walked up to the podium now, ready to address the audience. Of course, as always, the entire complex grew to  <BR>an unimaginable hushed silence. He had their respect, and had rightfully earned it. <BR> <BR>&#34;Citizens, though we are a small town, even we must heed the call to duty. Here with me today, is lieutenant Domingo Dracus of the Wolf Legion.&#34; As he spoke, he turned and waved one hand to the man in uniform. <BR> <BR>&#34;Told you.&#34; Curso said under his breath. <BR> <BR>    The man stood there for a minute, survey the crowd. His eyes fell across the four, each in turn. When he got the Curso, Curso thought it polite, or obnoxious, to wave. The man disregarded his presence in general then. His eyes did stop and study Axel for a brief moment. Axel turned and looked at the others a bit dumbfounded before  <BR>returning his sight to the man on the podium. <BR> <BR>&#34;Countrymen, I come with a decree from the King Melingo, that a call to arms has been ordered. Not a draft yet, but very possibly one could go into effect soon. I suggest you take this opportunity to enlist where you want. That way, you can at least choose where you go, instead of being drafted where we want you to go.&#34; <BR> <BR>One hand in the crowd rose slowly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, citizen?&#34; Dracus raised his hand slowly, beckoning the person to stand. <BR> <BR>A relatively old man stood and, scrabbling for words, asked, &#34;W-w-w-who does the k-king declare war on n-n-now? I was there f-f-for the first one, a-a-and there just isn&#39;t any point in attacking another d-defensless country.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That&#39;s enough, be seated, NOW!&#34; Dracus said as he pointed a harsh finger at the man. <BR> <BR>Naturally, the man sat down. then Dracus added, &#34;That war is over, and was fought for all the right reasons.&#34; <BR> <BR>He paused for a moment as his eyes dropped to the podium, he sighed lightly as he then said, &#34;You see, its not a government we intend on fighting. Technically, you can&#39;t call it a war for political purposes. For it is one we have never faced before. We can kill them, that much is clear, I myself have killed four in the past month.&#34; <BR> <BR>His gaze fell down to a piece of parchment in his belt, then he reared his head back and arched his back, resuming his military form, &#34;All who wish to join, see me later. i&#39;ll be at the Inn for the remainder of this week. That means you have three days to sign up or more than likely be forced to sign up. Good day.&#34; <BR> <BR>As he left, mayor Korelli stepped up to the podium. Someone in the audience yelled, &#34;What does he want us to fight?&#34; <BR> <BR>The mayor shock his head slightly, &#34;I&#39;m not sure, but they probably are desperate if they send recruiters here. Whatever this is, we can&#39;t hide from it. Certainly, it will sweep us up too if we don&#39;t stand with our nation to fight. It has come to my attention that most of the other sovereign countries have allied with us against something, but its very hush hush right now. I would encourage each family to send at least their strongest and oldest champions to the battle.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Son of a...&#34; Curso said loudly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Curso, don&#39;t be a little girl about it.&#34; Axel said heavily. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey!&#34; Vertigo said sharply. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m going.&#34; Incognito inserted. <BR> <BR>&#34;You must be joking?&#34; Curso said stupidly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why not?&#34; Axel added. <BR> <BR>&#34;You&#39;re both nuts, they won&#39;t even tell us what we&#39;re fighting.&#34; Curso persisted stubbornly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, that&#39;s probably on a need to know basis.&#34; Vertigo said bluntly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, I think I need to know if I&#39;m going to go fight it.&#34; Curso spoke as he crossed his arms. <BR> <BR>&#34;Grow up.&#34; Axel jested. <BR> <BR>&#34;Blow, Axel.&#34; Curso shot back. <BR> <BR>&#34;Curso, you&#39;re over reacting. this is a chance for you to do all that butt kicking you talk about.&#34; Vertigo said as she swatted him on the back. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, I still haven&#39;t seen it.&#34; Incognito laughed. <BR> <BR>Vertigo giggled slightly and Axel rumbled a bit. <BR> <BR>&#34;Tomorrow, big boy,&#34; Curso challenged, &#34;At Vert&#39;s place, me and you Incognito.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok.&#34; Incognito laughed more. <BR> <BR>The lot of them were laughing now. <BR> <BR>&#34;Excuse me.&#34; A mighty voice rumbled from Curso&#39;s right. <BR> <BR>&#34;Did you fart, Axel?&#34; Curso asked as he turned. But it wasn&#39;t Axel, it was Domingo Dracus. <BR> <BR>Curso gulped a bit while Dracus added, &#34;Indeed. May I speak to your burly friend in private? Axel, was it?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes sir.&#34; Axel replied. <BR> <BR>&#34;You have the look of a promising Wolf soldier youth, perhaps you might sign under my command. Come let us talk.&#34; Dracus said as he lead Axel away. <BR> <BR>Curso mocked with a puffed bottom lip and a squeaky voice, &#34;Indeed, huf-huf-huf-huf-huf.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Curso stop.&#34; Vertigo said. <BR> <BR>&#34;What? The guy&#39;s a jerk.&#34; Curso persisted as he turned to see Axel and Dracus talking in the corner, &#34;And what&#39;s with &#39;Dracus&#39; anyway? Sounds like a member of the Dragon cord, not Wolf. I bet he can&#39;t even hold that Gore Baton.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Watch it, Curso.&#34; Incognito warned. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fine. I&#39;m signing on for Tiger, though, they at least let you use your own weapons. You two as well?&#34; Curso asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;Sure, why not. I&#39;ve never been that far north before, neither has Incognito.&#34; Vertigo smiled at him. He kept his eyes down and his hood drawn, but she knew she was right. <BR> <BR>Axel strolled back over to them, most of the place had cleaned out now. Dracus was leaving. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, Mr. Prissy pants, what did Caption dung want anyway?&#34; Curso asked rudely. <BR> <BR>&#34;Something about signing on for Wolf.&#34; Axel said as he sat on the bench in front of the group. <BR> <BR>&#34;Going to?&#34; Vertigo asked? <BR> <BR>&#34;Maybe...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No man,&#34; Curso said, &#34;Tiger lets you use your family weapons, they&#39;re more open for that. That&#39;s who we&#39;re signing on for. Why don&#39;t you?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Why not, Axel?&#34; Incognito asked, &#34;Ones just as pointless as the others, just less weapon training.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok, I really don&#39;t care.&#34; Axel stated. <BR> <BR>&#34;Good, at least this way we can watch each other&#39;s backs.&#34; Vertigo agreed. <BR> <BR>&#34;It is settled then,&#34; Incognito spoke, &#34;Tomorrow we meet back here, then we go to the Inn and sign on. I&#39;ll walk Vertigo home, you two just go on back to your houses.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Awww.&#34; Curso said mockingly, he then clasped an invisible head in both his hands, kissing it profusely. <BR> <BR>Vertigo whopped him on the head with her hat again, and, like every other time, he jumped behind Axel. They laughed. Same old routines would change after tonight. They laughed aloud as they parted ways, the night before they make the biggest changes in their lives. <BR> <BR>-Tell me if you like the charactor set up. CHB-
