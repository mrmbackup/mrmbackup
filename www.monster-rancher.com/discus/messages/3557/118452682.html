 Hey everybody! One of my favorite shows of all time is whose line is it anyway. I decided it would be great to make a Monster Rancher parody of it. It will be broken into three scenes. Each of the scenes will be broken up by a commercial break. Here&#39;s the first scene and feedback would be nice. After all, this is something i&#39;ve never tried before. <BR> <BR>Whose Line Is It Anyway?  <BR>MR Style Scene 1 <BR> <BR>R. A. Ms. = Random Audience Members <BR>&#42;…&#42; =action <BR> <BR>Garu: Good Evening my fellow monsters and welcome to Whose Line Is It Anyway? Let’s meet our contestants who are all of the Garu breed! <BR> <BR>&#42;Camera focuses on the four Garus in the back of the room&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: The guy whose permanently red eyes could use some Visine Tears®, Zabel!!! <BR> <BR>&#42;Zabel smiles and waves at the audience who are cheering&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: The Garu whose loud colors could annoy even a deaf man, MermaGaru! <BR> <BR>&#42;MermaGaru waves at the audience who are cheering&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: The Garu whose third eye blind, Trieye! <BR> <BR>&#42;Trieye waves at the audience who are cheering&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: And finally, the Garu who has every strength of a Ripper except the tail, Shidao! <BR> <BR>&#42;Shidao waves at the audience as they cheer&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: Finally, I’m the pure bred Garu, your host for tonight. In this show, contestants will perform crazy antics to earn the most amount of points. Keep in mind that the points are as worthless as Yuri’s battle training! <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: Okay, the first game is called Superheroes! This is for all of our contestants. <BR> <BR>&#42;All four of the Garus get up to center stage. All but Zabel go off to the side&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: Okay, here are the rules. You are a group of superheroes who are trying to avert a world crisis that will be determined by the audience. As each of you enter the scenario the one who entered before you will give you a name. However, we need a name for Zabel so folks what will it be?! <BR> <BR>R. A. Ms.: Pink Eye Guy! <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs and Zabel chuckles under his breathe&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: Okay, Zabel, you’re Pink Eye Guy! And for a world crisis we have- <BR> <BR>R. A. Ms.: There are no more eyes drops in the world! <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: Okay, Pink Eye guy, you’re at a major loss here, there are no more eye drops in the world. Here we go! <BR> <BR>&#42;Zabel starts rubbing his eyes frantically&#42; <BR> <BR>Zabel: Dammit! Why don’t my eyes ever stop hurting? Man, I gotta go to the Inn and get some eye drops. What!? No more eye drops? This is truly a crisi-Ow!  <BR> <BR>&#42;Zabel starts rubbing his eyes again. Audience chuckles&#42; <BR> <BR>Zabel: This sucks big time. I’d better call my super friends! <BR> <BR>&#42;MermaGaru jumps down to the stage&#42; <BR> <BR>MermaGaru: Sorry I’m late, what seems to be the problem?  <BR> <BR>Zabel: Thank god you’re here, Girly Golem Man! <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs at the first funny thing Zabel said all night&#42; <BR> <BR>MermaGaru: &#42;In a girly voice&#42; Oh, hello, um…, Pink Eye Guy, hey do like my butt? <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs. Zabel starts rubbing his eyes&#42; <BR> <BR>Zabel: If I could see right now, I’d tell you! <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs&#42; <BR> <BR>MermaGaru: &#42;In the same girly voice&#42; So, what seems to be the problem? <BR> <BR>Zabel: There’re no more eye drops in the world! Man, what bad timing <BR> <BR>MermaGaru: &#42;Girly laugh&#42; Sucks for you. At least they still have eye liner. <BR> <BR>&#42;MermaGaru starts putting on invisible make-up. Audience laughs. Trieye enters the room&#42; <BR> <BR>Trieye: Sorry I’m late, everyone. <BR> <BR>MermaGaru: Thank goodness you’re here, Fiddler On The Roof! Oh, by the way, do you like my butt?  <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs as MermaGaru slaps his behind&#42; <BR> <BR>Trieye: &#42;snivels and admires MermaGaru’s development&#42; Sings- Is this the little boy I carried? <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs&#42; <BR> <BR>Trieye: Sings- When did he grow to be so tall? Wasn’t it yesterday when he… was… small?!!! <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs and applauds. Zabel is still rubbing his eyes&#42; <BR> <BR>Zabel: You know, Fiddler On The Roof, I admire your singing and all, but does anyone have any idea when this crisis will end?! <BR> <BR>Trieye: Singing- Sunrise, Sunset… Sunrise, Sunset… <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs and applauds. Shidao runs onto the stage&#42; <BR> <BR>Trieye: &#42;Begins to play an imaginary fiddle&#42; Thank goodness you’re here, Dog Tied to a Fence Man! <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs. Shidao crouches and starts barking at the three superheroes. He jumps at Trieye but is jerked back by an invisible chain. Audience laughs.&#42; <BR> <BR>Shidao: Grrrrrrrrr… <BR> <BR>&#42;Shidao lunges at the other two but is jerked back both times. Audience is laughing hysterically&#42; <BR> <BR>Shidao: Woof! <BR> <BR>&#42;Shidao walks over to Trieye and lifts his leg. Audience stands up to applaud as Shidao bleeds the lizard all over Trieye’s leg. Buzzer sounds&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: &#42;laughing under his breathe&#42; Okay, I know we usually let you all walk off the stage but for time’s sake we have to move onto the next game which is the mystery dating game! <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience cheers&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: In this game, Shidao is our contestant trying to find his true love. <BR> <BR>&#42;Shidao puts his finger in his mouth and pretends to barf. The Audience chuckles&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: Each of the three contestants have been given a card that gives them their personality game. At the end of the game, if you can guess what each of them were you’ll win some imaginary points. <BR> <BR>&#42;Each of the Garus starts laughing at their cards.&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: Okay, Shidao has been taken backstage so that all of the audience can know who is what. Each of the three will read their card to the audience, starting with Zabel! <BR> <BR>Zabel: &#42;laughing&#42; I’m an inebriated Joker. <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs&#42; <BR> <BR>MermaGaru: &#42;chuckling&#42; I’m a Zan with a thorn stuck in its butt! <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs&#42; <BR> <BR>Trieye: &#42;Staring blankly at his card&#42; I’m supposed to be a Mocchi with short term memory loss… <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience laughs and applauds&#42; <BR> <BR>Garu: After the break we’ll be back to see if Shidao has what it takes to discover the identities of his secret admirers. Don’t touch that remote folks we’ll be back with more Whose Line Is It Anyway? after this! <BR> <BR>&#42;Audience cheers&#42;  <BR> <BR>Hope you liked it! -Icelord13
