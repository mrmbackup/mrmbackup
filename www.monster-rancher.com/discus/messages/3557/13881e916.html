 Clay shook his head and sighed. He went trekking endless hours through the Mandy desert to find this disc, and what did he get? An Ape! A stinking, filthy, lazy, spoiled, dumb Ape! On the way back to the ranch, he didn&#39;t even look at it, he was so disgusted. Right now, he was watching him train with his Golem, Joe.  <BR>     Joe was his father&#39;s monster, and was incredibly old. He wasn&#39;t fit to fight in tournaments, but he was a great coach in physical areas. He had Wracky blood in him, and he always wore a tuxedo. <BR>     &#34;He actually seems to be doing quite well so far,&#34;. Clay turned and faced Minna, his mother&#39;s monster. She was a pink Suezo with small wings, obviously descended from a Pixie somewhere along the line. She was incredibly fast and accurate, and exorbitantly smart, even able to speak She coached monsters in more subtle areas than Joe. <BR>     &#34;Just wait a bit. As soon he acts up once, I&#39;l have to yell at him, and he won&#39;t do a bit of again,&#34;, Clay said with a bit of a harsh tone in his voice <BR>     &#34;Do you forget your grandfather, Clay?&#34;,. Clay hated it when Minna did that, pointing out exactly where he was wrong. Clay&#39;s grandfather had been the Champion at his peak, with an Ape named Boomer. He was oobscenely strong and tough, and was actually quite intelligent. <BR>     &#34;I guess you&#39;re right&#34;, Clay said, then approached his new monster. It was a pure-strain Ape, with mostly brown fur, and a few patches of color. Clay laid his hand on it&#39;s shoulder, and the Ape turned and regarded him. &#34;A hereby name you Boomer II,&#34;.  Boomer II picked his nose. &#34;Glad you understand the importance of that moment&#34;, Clay mumbled as he left <BR>     The first six months went on. Surprisingly, Boomer II excelled in his training. His muscles grew at an exponential rate, and he even showed profenciency at learning speed, accuracy and smarts. Finally, the time he fought a battle came <BR>      <BR>To be continued
