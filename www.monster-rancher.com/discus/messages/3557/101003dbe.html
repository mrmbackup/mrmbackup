<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
I will be adding to this periodically. <BR> <BR>&#42; Tecmo could not call it&#39;s new game &#39;Monster Farm&#39; in North America because there had been a cartoon show by Saban by the same <A HREF="http://www.tv.com/monster-farm/show/20987/summary.html?tag=tabs;summary" TARGET="_blank">name</A> airing in 1998. <BR> <BR>&#42; Monster Rancher 2 was released, by SCEE, in PAL regions as &#34;Monster Rancher&#34; because MR1 was never published there. To this day, PAL users show up and insist that they are not playing MR2, that they are playing MR1 &#39;but the Dinos are called Zuums sometimes&#39;. <BR> <BR>&#42; Free CDs and free DVDs are really cool. Not only is the price right, they often make cool monsters. I have often gotten really hard-to-find monsters from free discs. <BR> <BR>&#42; Monster Rancher 2 was released in the US with two different covers. One has the fanciful Datonare, the other a Zilla. <BR> <BR>&#42; In 2000, Tecmo&#39;s warehouse was broken into, and 15,000 copies of MR2 were stolen, nothing else was taken. <BR> <BR>&#42; Monster Rancher was the first game to ever use &#39;reading CDs&#39; as part of a game. <BR> <BR>&#42; Monster Rancher 2 was supposed to support the Sony PocketStation device &#40;the Japanese Monster Farm 2 does support it&#41;, but Sony decided to cancel the item for the US market about 4 months before MR2 was slated for a US release. This forced Tecmo to re-work the game to remove the PocketStation from game menus, etc. &#40;They apparently didn&#39;t have enough time to remove everything completely.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42; There are 2 versions of MR3 in the US. The only noticable difference between the two is whether or not some gameshark codes work on it. <BR> <BR>&#42; Monster Rancher 3 was the first PS2 game to use Picture Paradise technology. So far, only MR3 and RPG Maker 2 use this technology. <BR> <BR>&#42; All but one MR game have arrived on time or early at retail stores. MR3 as delayed one week because of shipping problems caused by 9/11/2001. The Sony factory ran out of the plastic needed to make games, and had to delay all scheduled games by a week. <BR> <BR>&#42; Starting in 2001, upon receiving a press release for Monster Rancher Advance, for Game Boy Advance, Electronics Boutique, and their website ebworld.com listed Monster Rancher Advance for Xbox. They kept this listing online through November 2002. They even used the feature list for the GBA game from Tecmo press releases in this incorrect listing &#40;battle your friends via link cable, take the game with you to play on the go, etc.-all mildly humorous, as visions of lugging XBoxes around as a convenience is simply insane...&#41; on the website. Tecmo contacted EB for YEARS in attempts to get them to change the listing, but they flat out refused. Tecmo even had to resort to sending out press releases announcing that the listing was a mistake, &#40;even creating a special website for the press release&#41; because EB refused to remove the listing. So, for years we were inundated with people wanting to know more about Monster Rancher Advance for XBox, and we linked them to the official press release from Tecmo about it.  <BR> <BR>&#42; Monster Rancher toys, posters, t-shirts &#40;kid&#39;s sized only&#41;, watches, banners, halloween costumes and more were produced and sold in 1999 in the US &#40;mainly featuring ADV Film&#39;s character &#34;Genki&#34;&#41;. Most items did not sell well enough to warrant production of new items. <BR> <BR>&#42; Playmates&#39; Toys made the plastic US toys. The announced, but cancelled a series of plush figures. <BR> <BR>&#42; Plush figures were manufactured exclisvely for claw machines in the US in 1999, by Strottman Intnl. They were: <BR>Tiger, 2 sizes <BR>Hare, 2 sizes <BR>Mocchi, 2 sizes <BR>Golem, 2 sizes <BR>Suezo, 1 size <BR> <BR>&#42; Many, many more toys were made for the Japanese market.  <BR> <BR>&#42; Many, many more copies of Monster Rancher games are sold in Japan, where the game is called &#39;Monster Farm&#39;. Compare cumulative sales figures: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Title</TD><TD>US</TD><TD>Japan </TD></TR><TR><TD>Monster Rancher</TD><TD>85&#44;433</TD><TD>496&#44;197 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Monster Rancher 2</TD><TD>186&#44;403</TD><TD>640&#44;246 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Monster Rancher 3</TD><TD>72&#44;152</TD><TD>182&#44;942 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Monster Rancher 4</TD><TD>unknown</TD><TD>183&#44;784 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Monster Rancher 5</TD><TD>14&#44;777</TD><TD>48&#44;653 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Monster Rancher Advance 2</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>48&#44;273 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Monster Farm DS</TD><TD>n/a</TD><TD>21&#44;914 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Monster Farm DS2</TD><TD>n/a</TD><TD>30&#44;825</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>&#42; The Monster Rancher cartoon was created by ADV films, and they own the rights to the character of &#39;Genki&#39; -in addtion to the music and other character rights. <BR> <BR>&#42; In 1999 there were several hundred active message boards about the MR games. This site, at our old location, was one of the smaller ones. <BR> <BR>&#42;We were originally a special interest board split off an existing Monster Rancher board, started in 1997, with the purpose of discussing news of the upcoming release of Monster Farm 2 in Japan in Spring of 1999. <BR> <BR>&#42; In 1999/2000, at our old site, this board averaged 5,000 new posts a week. <BR> <BR>&#42; In 2001, Tecmo asked for input for the MR3 game. Once US gamers saw the 5 year old Fleria, in the Japanese game, the #1 request was to have an older assistant, because a 5 year old made the game seem like a little kid&#39;s game. Once the game was released a lot of people complained that she should have stayed 5. <BR> <BR>&#42; When MR2 came out, people who had played MR1 called it &#34;too cute&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#42; When people who played MR2 first picked up MR1, they called it &#34;ugly&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#42; When MR3 came out, people who played MR2 and MR1 called it &#34;too cute&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#42; When people who played MR3 first try MR1 or MR2, they call them &#34;ugly&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#42; The monster-rancher.com url was originally created by Reed Dotto, aka &#39;Fade&#39; or &#39;Bobby Fatman&#39; for his geocities site in October 1999. You can view it <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/19991012122817/http://monster-rancher.com/" TARGET="_blank">HERE</A> in the <A HREF="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php" TARGET="_blank">WayBack Machine.</A> You can view the history of all site updates at the main <A HREF="http://wayback.archive.org/web/19990715000000*/http://monster-rancher.com" TARGET="_blank">WayBack Machine monster-rancher.com page.</A> <BR> <BR>&#42; The monster-rancher.com url expired on 7/21/2003 when the original owner decided to no longer pay to keep it. The site was completely offline for three months when I decided to purchase the URL, which had been on the open market available to anyone during the entire 3 month period. <BR> <BR>&#42; When we moved from our old site, we had to think up a site name fast, in under one day. The MRM name <B>is</B> a tribute to one of the first Science Fiction films ever made: Fritz Lang&#39;s <I>Metropolis</I>. &#40;There is a great DVD of this film, <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007L4MJ/qid=1074745112//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl74/103-4517160-6667820?v=glance&amp;s=dvd&amp;n=507846" TARGET="_blank">See it at Amazon.com</A>.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42; The MRM Laboratory section is named in honor of the Monster Rancher Battle Card Episode II game. The Laboratory in that game gave me the first clues to cracking the CD read process. <BR> <BR>&#42; Some of Tecmo&#39;s PSX games have bonus music tracks on them. Place these game in a CD player to hear them: <BR>Monster Rancher <BR>Monster Rancher Hop A Bout <BR>Tecmo Stackers <BR>Dead or Alive <BR>Gallop Racer <BR>Tecmo Super Bowl <BR>Deception &#40;sorry no music on Deception 2 or 3&#41; <BR>Super Shot Soccer
