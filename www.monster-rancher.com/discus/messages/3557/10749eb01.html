 I took Devlin and Stefioni home. To tell you the truth, I hadn’t a clue as to what to do with them. I decided to write to Thomas. I thought maybe he could send some wisdom my way. <BR> <BR>“Dear Thomas, <BR>Thank you for the disc. For some reason, it gave me two monsters: an Ogyo and a Gitan. Do you know what they are? If you do, information on them would be much appreciated. How should I go about training these two? I have no training equipment. I’ll try to figure something out. I hope to hear from you soon. Farewell! <BR>Sincerely, <BR>James Nottap&#42;” <BR> <BR>The next day, I awoke to Devlin on my bed and Stefioni right next to it. They were both staring at me. It made me uneasy, but at the same time, very calm. They must’ve been waiting for me, because the beds I made for them were not messed. I had never met a monster that didn’t sleep. “Uh,” I started, “Devlin, would you go get some eggs from the chicken coop?” As soon as I finished my sentence, he was off. His loyalty was way too low to be doing things for me on the first day. This also bugged me a bit. <BR> <BR>I waited downstairs in the kitchen with Stefioni for Devlin to come back with the eggs. Squawking was heard, and I thought the worst. I ran outside, and to my surprise, found Devlin with a basketful of eggs, and not a single chicken harmed. They were just spooked by his appearance. We went back inside and I started cooking the eggs, while Stefioni fussed with her frills, and Devlin played around with his staff. <BR> <BR> Breakfast was eaten, and I went into the living room to try to think of something for them to do. I called them in and asked them what they liked to do. Devlin seemed to like zapping things with his pitchfork and I couldn’t really get what Stefioni was trying to say. Winter was coming, so I figured that Devlin would enjoy chopping up some wood with his pitchfork. While he was doing that, I had Stefioni help me tidy up the house. In the evening, I showed them their beds, but the still wouldn’t sleep. Exasperated, I ordered them to go to bed, and they did! <BR> <BR>The next few days went by pretty much the same way. Eventually, Devlin and Stefioni became stronger. In the following week, a tournament was being held, and Devlin looked like he could take some of the Rank E monsters down. As I was contemplating this, a letter came in the mail. It was addressed from Thomas! <BR> <BR> <BR>Well, here&#39;s the next part. Enjoy!
