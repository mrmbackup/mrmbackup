 &#40;Since it took me forever to type up a new chapter, I decided to make an extra long one this time. Enjoy.&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Dadge marched down the large hallway in somewhat disbelief. He had run into a small patrol of Jills on the path and they could clearly see what shape he was in. Thus, they decided to take him to their leader. Dadge was dwarfed as he walked along side the massive Jill, named Grendel, the Jill&#39;s Shaman. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, why hasn&#39;t anyone ever found this place?&#34; Dadge asked as he marveled at the tile floor and bright-white walls. <BR> <BR>&#34;Simple, no one ever comes up here. We don&#39; get too many visitors as you may have guessed.&#34; Grendel said as they reached a rather large door. <BR> <BR>This was very odd for Dadge. He was first taken into a small cave and, from there, ended up in this hallway in front of something resembling heaven&#39;s gate. The bright, vibrant white seemed to explode from every direction. The door was trimmed with a touch of gold and silver. <BR> <BR>&#34;Welcome to my humble home.&#34; the modest Jill said as he pushed the gargantuan doors open. <BR> <BR>Dadge found himself awed to say the least. The entire mountain hollowed out to reveal a hidden city underneath. Thousands of Jills walked down streets, carrying out their daily chores. Humanlike in every way. Dadge followed Grendel down a small flight of stairs and into the city. Dadge noted a bakery, a carpenter, and even a jewel store. He became feeling uneasy as he gained more and more unwanted fame as they walked. <BR> <BR>&#34;Umm...I take it they aren&#39;t as friendly as you are...&#34; Dadge said slowly as he struggled to keep pace with the Shaman, &#34;I&#39;ve never caught so many looking at me.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Relax, my friend, humans don&#39;t visit us to often, remember? Your probably the first human most of them have ever seen.&#34; Grendel said. <BR> <BR>Then, Dadge noticed some of the Jill guard. They were wearing some kind of battlements that Dadge had never seen before. They were like suits of metal and machinery. What seemed like guns were on their wrists. They marched by, talking to each other about their daily lives. <BR> <BR>&#34;W-w-what are those?&#34; Dadge said as he watched them march down the street. <BR> <BR>&#34;Those are the jillish guard.&#34; Grendel said as he too a left down another road. <BR> <BR>&#34;No, no, what they were wearing?&#34; Dadge said as he caught up with the Jill. <BR> <BR>&#34;We call those &#39;Clovers&#39;. Battle gear to help us fight the swarm. Basically, a battle suit of sorts. We Jills are strong, yes, but we are also very intelligent. We have much technological advancement over your race. Due to virtually no crime, we all tend to work for the better good, and not squabble over trivial things such as possession or property.&#34; Then, he stopped and stared down a road to their left. <BR> <BR>Dadge looked, and was hit with a feeling that hounded him from when he entered the city, awe. A giant, golden statue stood in the center of the square. It was a sculpture of a Jill in an early version of the Clover. He had his hand in the air, punching downward at a foe. The enemy somewhat looked like Roketh, except he had four arms, and was slightly bigger. Dadge then read what was inscribed in it: <BR> <BR>&#34;The Battle for all life. The Lord of Evil, Kingston, falling at the hands of our champion, Grendel.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge turned and could barely speak, &#34;You-you-you are one of the-the eight Lords!?&#34; <BR> <BR>The Jill said nothing, merely nodded. <BR> <BR>&#34;I know your Lord, Roketh. Listen, you got to help him. There is this Dragon named Nightmare that destroyed so much. I have to tell Roketh.&#34; Dadge said hastily. <BR> <BR>The Jill mustered the strength to hide a smile, failing miserably, &#34;Allow me to fill you in on current events.&#34; <BR> <BR>Grendel explained to Dadge about what all happened, the battle with Kingston, the arrival of Kronock. <BR> <BR>Dadge was somewhat puzzled as they reach a rather large building, &#34;How do you know all this?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Like I said, we are far more advanced than you. We have monitored Roketh since Jace awoke him in that lab. At some points, I thought I&#39;d have to intervene, but he always pulled out on top.&#34; Grendel said as he pushed another set of massive doors open. <BR> <BR>Dadge followed him into a lab that would put his to shame. It was so big, and an elevator to boot. Grendel stepped onto a little clear saucer, and motioned Dadge to join him. As Dadge stepped on, the disc began going upward. After a while, Dadge noticed they were higher than the city. The lab was in the side of the mountain, which means there was no telling how big this lab was. About that time, Grendel began to speak. <BR> <BR>&#34;I have a small favor to ask of you, my new friend. A small price, and all we can offer in return is our hospitality.&#34; Grendel said slowly. <BR> <BR>&#34;No problem, what is it?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You&#39;ll see when we get there, small one.&#34; Grendel said as he returned his gaze to over his city. <BR> <BR>Dadge monitored the area, too. He felt very badly about this. He couldn&#39;t get the flash of the Clovers out of his head. The only vulnerable spots were under their arms, their knees, and their heads. He supposed that they needed more room to see what is going on around them. Then, the circle they were upon slowed down and stopped. Dadge took up his original task of following Grendel through a hallway. Above the door it led to, there was a sign that read, &#39;Experimental&#39;. <BR> <BR>As they went in, Dadge saw what was behind the glass, and it looked just his size. He placed his palms upon the glass, and softly leaned against it. <BR> <BR>&#34;You see, friend, this model is a very new prototype. We manufactured it, but we couldn&#39;t make one large enough for a Jill, so we downsized a bit and doubled the plating. Outfitted with our finest weapons, we simply could get nothing more than a Jill child to operate it, which I think not. We need you to help us try it out. If the test proves successful, you keep it. Free of charge, we merely want to see if the design is any good, then we can shape all-new Clovers from the results. What do you say?&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge slowly turned to the Jill and said simply, &#34;When do I start?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We will start soon. For now, you need some rest after you tiring journey.&#34; Grendel said as he headed towards the elevator. <BR> <BR>Dadge turned back to the bright-red Clover in the glass seal. Since it required less material, it had hardly any vulnerable spots, and still looked agile enough to give any foe a bad day. Grendel also mentioned their finest weapons, if their weapons can boast their superior technology, he couldn&#39;t wait to try it. <BR> <BR>A few months later... <BR> <BR>Dadge stood outfitted on the outskirts of the town. He stood on the edge of a desolate wasteland. A crystal clear water fall fell from the side of the mountain, some distance aways. After it hit the ground, it became a murky brown color. Dadge had trained hard for months; this new machine was a success, indeed. Known as the Blood Clover, it was a force for even monsters to reckon with. Then, Dadge&#39;s headset rang clear with the voice of Grendel. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, son, tis the moment of truth at last.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I am confident, Shaman.&#34; Dadge said as he stared into the distant corners of the underground, baron wasteland. He noted a few holes in the wall on the other side. They seemed to litter the wall up and down. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, now for the briefing. Proceed down the cliff-side and begin weapons check.&#34; Grendel said as he went out. <BR> <BR>Dadge hit his jetpack to about 30% power. Enough to hover, but not plummeting. Before you say it, yes, they did have jetpacks. Somehow, they Jills found a fuel source that was self-replenishing. If you burned it all down at once, you&#39;d have to wait for the fumes to build themselves up. Dadge slowly lowered into the outskirts of the town, a place they never had colonized. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey Grendel, how come you never progressed out here?&#34; Dadge said as he shut down his engine. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok, we got you on screen. Surveillance is up and running. All right, we are set. The reason why is because we are constantly under attack by the swarm in that area, a colony of insect-like creatures that really on their natural weapons, as to our technology. We need that area and the colony dead. That area has become one of the richest delta&#39;s the world has ever seen. If we get it, we will be able to support our growing numbers even better. All in all, progression my friend.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Roger that Grendel, but do I take the swarm by myself?&#34; Dadge asked, a bit worried. <BR> <BR>&#34;Not at all. We have an army in the wings if things get too hairy. You see, their queen is very honorable. She will fight you one on one. Just taunt her out, and she will enjoy a good fight. Be warned, if she starts losing, she will let her dogs loose on you, and only by the grace of god will you escape with your life then.&#34; Grendel spoke as Dadge surveyed his surroundings. <BR> <BR>&#34;What if she doesn&#39;t come out?&#34; Dadge asked, a bit stunned with his newest mission. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh, she&#39;ll come out. I remember one young Jill challenged her, and that was one hell of a fight.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge was a bit stunned, &#34;Did he win? Or did you rescue him?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sadly, his was torn to shreds. At any case...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;W-w-what?!&#34; Dadge caught Grendel before he could stray from the subject. <BR> <BR>&#34;That doesn&#39;t matter right now. You are superior to him and the Queen. He was headstrong, yet if he can fight a good battle, certainly you can do the same.&#34; Grendel spoke to Dadge. <BR> <BR>&#34;...Alright. I think I&#39;ll check those holes first.&#34; Dadge said as he hit his jets again. <BR> <BR>&#34;Roger that Dadge. Just coax her out and remember, kill her before she can escape and/or get her minions on you.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok. Here queeny, queeny, queeny...&#34; Dadge spoke slowly, as if calling a cat. <BR> <BR>Then, historical laughter filled his helm. Grendel and the others could not with hold their laughter. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hahaa...Dadge...aha...no more. The Queen is not young, insulting her intellect will only <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> her off.&#34; Grendel said as the laughter in the background made Dadge feel about a foot tall. <BR> <BR>Then, Dadge heard a slight hum. The laughter quickly stopped and Dadge&#39;s helm was then filled with a buzzing noise. Out of nowhere, Dadge&#39;s legs shot forward as he was clipped by an unknown adversary. Throwing his legs up sent his body back. Dadge found himself flying in the other direction. He instantly realized his jetpack was sideways and it was propelling him towards the farthest wall. He had no choice but to shut off his pack and free fall a short ways. He leveled out the best he could as he fell, then hit his pack again. As he reclaimed his balance, he looked up to see a bee-like creature-barreling strait towards him. Dadge leveled his left arm even with the monstrous bug, and the Wolf-380 came out of the compartment on the back of his forearm. <BR> <BR>The Wolf-380 is a small cannon of sorts. By bombarding Silicon infused into U2 shells with electrons and Carbon-12, a small spark then fires off. The spark causes a concentrated blast, igniting the shell, which propels itself. Upon contact, the Electrons scatter quickly and cause a massive explosion. Also, U2 shells are easily replicated in a pack on the pack of the gunman, thus, infinite ammunition. In short, a small cannon with a nasty bite. <BR> <BR>Dadge fired one shot off at the bug. A large explosion rang forth as Dadge regained his balance. He quickly searched the area, and then he spotted the charred form of the insect falling like a rock. A small stream of smoke was following his corpse s it fell. Dadge decided to take a closer looked at it. <BR> <BR>He landed not far from where the body was. He trained his Wolf-380 on the twitching body. He had lived too long to start taking chances now. He slowly walked over to the smoking corpse. The bug was on its back and, from this angle, looked a hack of a lot less like a bee, more like a mantis. He could tell he hit it head up, because its head had been completely blown off. About six legs and one mean looking stinger. It did have a yellow underside, and the top half did look like a bee. A highbred? <BR> <BR>&#34;Dadge!? Come in Dadge!?&#34; Grendel exclaimed over the radio. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yo, I&#39;m here.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Alright, we lost visual when that scout clipped you. We have you again now, are you alright?&#34; Grendel asked a bit nervously. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, a scout you say?&#34; Dadge was a bit nervous now, as well. <BR> <BR>&#34;We registered an massive explosion from that direction. Was is the Harvenger?&#34; Grendel asked as the commotion in the back died down. <BR> <BR>&#34;No, the Wolf-380.&#34; Dadge said as the weapon returned to its compartment and he hit his jet again, &#34;I&#39;m going to those holes now. That seems like a good place for bug-royal blood...to be spilt that is.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge now was near the wall, slowly following it towards the holes in the wall. Then, something snagged his leg. As he turned, he heard a voice ring out, &#34;At long last, another warrior has come for the Queen.&#34; <BR> <BR>As Dadge looked at his leg, he was surprised to see webbing of some kind. He followed it to the wall, where the biggest spider he had ever seen had a firm hold on him. This spider shot web from its mouth, not its abdomen. It had a face, a human-like face with huge fangs. Drool slowly ran off each of these, no doubt waiting to be drenched in blood. <BR> <BR>Then, the spider springboarded at Dadge. Dadge hit engines full and barely went over the spider. The spider began to fall, but it was not going down with out a fight. As it hit the end of its silk, Dadge&#39;s accent was quickly ended. He found himself making a very sad attempt to hold his weight and the mass of a giant spider. The beast rolled over, now looking up at the warrior. <BR> <BR>&#34;You can&#39;t win, fool!&#34; The spider said as it spun quickly. <BR> <BR>The shear strength of the insect slung Dadge downwards. Dadge hit the mud with dreadful force. That&#39;s not the worst part, his jet was still on. He found himself bellydown; fire-balling through a merciless, baron wasteland with all kinds of horrid bugs attacking him. He looked up and saw the mountain wall dead ahead. He pulled up as hard as he could. He managed to pull himself vertical at the last minute. He was now running parallel with the wall of the cavern. He looked and saw several of the holes ahead of him. He quickly powered down before he went too high. He turned and searched the ground for the demonic spider that was now hounding him from a far. <BR> <BR>&#34;Coward! You can&#39;t escape now!&#34; <BR> <BR>Then he saw it. Scuttling across the dungeon&#39;s floor. Hissing as it occasionally glanced up at him. Now was the first time he was able to get a good view of the thing. Yellow and Black patterns coursed over its body. If it had eight eyes, he couldn&#39;t tell, but the two, large humanlike eyes over that maw of death was just freaky. <BR> <BR>Then, out of nowhere, another web latched around his right arm. He looked up to see another spider of roughly the same size looking down on him, with a line of webbing from its mouth. Its was also slowly reeling him in. At this point, the right arm compartment opened up slowly and a long, gattling gun of sorts appeared. This was the Harvenger, the secret weapon of the Jills. <BR> <BR>The Harvenger is based on the design of the mini-gun. Firing more than 80 rounds a second. The gun isn&#39;t the deadly part; it&#39;s the ammo. There are three types of ammunition invented. Armor Piercing, good versus the carapace of the insectoids. Incendiary, which pretty much catches everything on fire. Finally, the Spark. The most complex of them all. This is how it works. When the bullet hits its target, the head explodes to reveal a small, drill bit. The explosions should knock off a significant chunk of armor or carapace. Then, the drill head will dig into the exposed flesh or the soft tissue of the bugs, very painful too. Then, behind the drill is a small battery. Thousands of tiny rods come off the battery, into the flesh. Then, sending off a massive electrical current, the flesh is severely burnt. The cells in that area are burnt, and all the blueprints for healing are ruptured. Thus, the explosion will kill you, or you&#39;ll be crippled for life. <BR> <BR>Dadge aimed upwards and fired several AP shots at the spider. Most missed, but one faithful shot went into the beast&#39;s mouth. The rear of its head blew into a thousand pieces. A few chips of fang broke off and flew out the back of its head. The body fell limp and slumped over the edge. Dadge ripped the webbing away from his arm and trained the Harvenger on the second beast, and switched to Incendiary ammo. <BR> <BR>&#34;NO! You murderer!&#34; It&#39;s screeched as it scuttled faster towards him. <BR> <BR>Dadge let loose a volley of shells at the monster. The ground was instantly alive with blast of fire flaming upwards. Dadge let no area of the ground about it to go un-charred. Legs flew off of the beast in an eruption of flames and screams. As the dust settled, only a black, still, burnt corpse of a once horrid creature lay there, still. <BR> <BR>&#34;I can tell this is going to be a long mission.&#34; Dadge said slowly. <BR> <BR>He heard a scratching noise from a hole behind him. A shrill voice came from the crater. Dadge was a little scared now as the voice spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, impressive human. Now prepare to fall before the wrath of the Queen of the Swarm.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#40;Stay tuned. Tell me any suggestions&#41;
