<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>Jello</B> on <B>Tuesday, August 22, 2000 - 05:30 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
This is where I stopped writing for a while. <BR> <BR>Chapter Seven:Sea and Steele <BR> <BR>	 <BR> <BR>“Damn, damn, damn.”  Minion liked to cuss when he was worried.  “What are we gonna do about Scaler?” <BR>	The group was in Minion’s tent in the middle of the night, after Scaler was asleep.  Minion couldn’t think clearly, and he stared at the ground.  Scorpio &#40;the Priarocks&#41;  looked troubled.  “Guys, I don’t know Scaler all that well, but a very close friend of mine had the Bloodlust after his parents were killed by a band of robbers.  It’s terrible,” murmured Scorpio. <BR>	Gengen cornered him.   “Well, I’d like to know more about this Bloodlust.  I want to help my friend.” <BR>	Scorpio sighed.  “You have as much right to know as any one.  The Bloodlust is more a sickness then anything, and it’s a terrible sight to see.  I think that it is mostly Jells that have it, but there are other monsters that had it too. Imagine hating an enemy so much that even if he had a thousand backing him up, you’d charge and kill most of that thousand.  A monster taken by the Bloodlust can fight on, even though wounded almost to death.  They battle on still, as if fresh as a daisy, killing anyone that stands in the way, even their best friends.  Red eyed, black blooded, full of the lust for death, and scorning fear, that is the Bloodlust.  Worst thing that can happen to anyone, I believe.” <BR>	All the others hung on to every word.  Then Zimbo decided that they had better go to bed or Scaler is gonna wake up.  So they all went to bed, but, not surprisingly, none of them could sleep.  The next morning, they traveled on, then came to a dusty set of woods.  The trees stretched for as long as the eye could see, and you could just <I> smell </I> evil in the air.  The path that had been made wore off into dirt six feet before the entrance, and little bugs skittered about.  The trees were something none of them had seen before, with six foot wide trunks, the tops stretching for half a mile.  They had reached the Enchanted Woods.  “Oh. My. God,” Minion noted. <BR>	“Oh. My. God,” Baxter replied. <BR>	“Oh. My. God,” Gengen added helpfully. <BR>	“Oh. My. God,” Zimbo corrected. <BR>	“Oh. My. God.” Hanger responded. <BR>	“What are you guys Oh my goding about?” Scaler asked.  “Oh. My. God. Never mind.” <BR>	“Oh. My. God.” Scorpio said. <BR>	“Oh. My. God,” Deed responded in awe. <BR>	“Oh. My-” Minion started again, but was cut off by Scaler. <BR>	“NO ONE CARES!  GET ON WITH THE @#E$RR@#$%%%$@##@@@@@###$%$$%$@##$#$%^&amp;&#42;U&amp;^%%$#@!!@@#$@!ing  journey!!!” <BR>	So they continued into the thick forest. Suddenly, Minion shouted “Hey!  Guess who lives here? My friends-” <BR>	But he was cut off by a troop entering the area.  In the front a Garuda stood, proud and tall, his bird’s head bouncing up and down.  The patch of Burner was on his shirt, and it said: <B> 10th Troop.  Burner. </B> Behind him were over 500 different Tigers.  Trojan &#40;the big Durahan&#41; stepped forward.  “FireShield, how could you?” he asked angrily. <BR>	“No you fool!  Now we must battle!  Look what you have done!” Minion cried, pointing at Scaler.  The air around him started to glow orange, his eyes are bloodred,  his tongue hanging out crazily, his body turning jet-black.  Minion tried to throw himself in front of Scaler, but Scorpio stopped him.  FireShield stepped back behind the troops, telling them to attack Scaler.  Ten Tigers were down, dead before they knew it.  A pure Tiger, a general, decided that he didn’t want to fight, so he turned around.  Big mistake. Scaler stretched out an arm in the shape of a chainsaw &#40;he was somehow avoiding the magic rule that no weapens can be made with their hands&#41;  The Tiger was sliced in half, along with many of his friends. <BR>The rest of the gang joined the battle too.  Hanger and Zimbo were fighting a pack of hungry Tigers who were just in this war for food.  However, they make strong warriors.  Hanger saw two Tigers jumping at Zimbo’s neck, and for him, everything went in slow motion.  Zimbo, raising his long, scaled arm to block a &#40;Tiger/Hare&#41;’s attack. He didn’t see the attacks on the necks coming.   Hanger blew a Drill Shot at one of the Tigers going for the neck, and it hit, knocking him out of orbit.  The second one he used Laser Swords on, and cut it in half in midair.  The back part of the body fell to the ground, but the rest of it kept on going.  The front of the Tiger’s body knocked Zimbo down, and soon he was covered in Tigers.  Hanger ran to help, but a couple of Tigers slowed him down.  Meanwhile, the 10th Troop was winning the battle.  Scaler’s Bloodlust started wearing down.  He had killed around 200 Tigers, but the Garuda was really powerful.  Deed ran up next to FireShield, and the Garuda thought he was one of his troops.   <BR>	“Think fast, <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>!” yelled Deed, jumping for the throat.  FireShield neatly and calmly put his blade on his shoulder, making the sword go straight into Deed’s stomach.  Deed fell to the ground, a hole in it’s stomach.   <BR>	“DEED!!!” screamed Scaler.  “ANSWER ME!!! PLEASE!!!! COME ON, DEED.  PULL THROUGH!” <BR>	Minion took out his sword and stepped up to FireShield.  “This is for Deed!” he shouted, charging.   <BR>	But the Garuda neatly pushed him down, then brought his sword up high in the air, preparing to bring it down on Minion’s helpless body.  Suddenly, a flash of silver and yellow in the trees.  FireShield glanced up, and-BOOM!  Two beams from two different Beam Guns hit the Garuda.   FireShield glanced down at his body. What he saw was terrifying.  The bottum portion of his body was charred black.  He would never be able to walk again.  The rest of the Tigers were killed, except one, who snuck away to Burner.  The helpless Garuda looked up-at a ArrowHead’s tail.  Scorpio’s tail.  The blade went through his body like a knife through butter.  FireShield died, and the tenth troop eliminated.  Minion looked at Scaler, who was staggering and looking dazed.      <BR>	“NO!  I WON’T LET THEM TAKE YOU!”  Minion ran toward his friend.  As soon as he touched him, there is a huge blue light.  The light formed into words: <U> FRIENDSHIP IS POWERFUL. </U>  Then Scaler’s mouth opened and black blood spilled out.  He had lived through the Bloodlust! <BR>	Minion looked at the two monsters that saved thier lives, a Eye Jell and a Metal Jell.  “Hey, guys,” Minion said. <BR>	Then he turned to the rest of their friends.  “This is Sea,”he pointed to the Eye Jell. “Sea is crazy.  He is a goofball. And this is Steele. He is like me, serious. They are world-champion fighters, and they shall join us.  I think.”   <BR>	Sea nodded.  “I am an Eye Jell,” he motioned to his eye in the middle of his body.  “So I can see thru everything with my eye.  It helps when I’m looking at women.” <BR>	“Let’s find the injured.” Steele grunted.  <BR>	So they rounded up, and everybody was pretty much okay, except for Zimbo and Deed.  Zimbo’s head was seperated from his body, he was dead.  Deed-well, it didn’t look good.  They needed stronger medical kits to help.  But Hanger being Hanger pointed out that the enemy left behind all their stuff, no doubt there was a medi pack somewhere in there.  Sure enough, they found one, and went to work on Deed.  They did their best, and you will find out next chapter if he lives or not. <BR> <BR>				THE JOURNEY OF THE JELLS  <BR> <BR>Chapter Eight:The Wrath of Burner <BR> <BR> <BR>	The Jells were sitting in the tent, wondering what to do next.  Zimbo the Omega had died, Deed was almost dead.   <BR>	“Don’t worry, Scaler,” Minion said reassuringly.  “Sea and Steele know their medics.” <BR>	But Steele came out of the tent looking sad.  “It looks grim for Deed.  I’m estimating he has about ten days to live.  Only one thing can save him.  The Renneded Herb,” Steele tried to sound casual. <BR>	“Whaaa? Only one person has it and he ain’t givin’ it up!!!” Baxter shouted. <BR>	Minion was surprised at how smart Baxter was to know this.  After all, not all of the group knew it.  That one monster was going to be hard to convince. <BR> <BR>					&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>	“He, he, I win again.  I am the spit master!”  the Striker &#40;Naga/Zuum&#41; taunted.  Three Nagas were having a spitting contest in front of the castle gates.  <BR>	“Aw, <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> yer goddamn trap, Mack,” an Aqua Cutter &#40;Naga/Jell&#41; retorted. <BR>	Mack the Striker had spit four hundred feet. Just as a pure Naga spit towards the trees, a figure collapsed in front of them.  Mack &#40;the troop leader&#41; immediately jumped on it and pressed his fingers against its throat.  It was a Tiger.  The Tiger was bumped and bruised, bleeding in too many places to count, its back leg was hanging by a strand, the eyes in his head were looking up, his paw was bleeding, he had about half of his teeth gone, and there was a huge hole in his side that looked like and ArrowHead’s tail mark.   <BR>	“What happened here?” Mack asked strictly. <BR>	“Burner...must...tell...Burner...” the Tiger choked out before fainting.  <BR>	  <BR>						&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>	The Daina &#40;Pixie/Dragon&#41; walked confidently toward the castle.  The forest was hers, the castle was almost hers, and the idiot guards at the castle gate were hers.  <BR>	“Who goes there?” asked an Obelisk &#40;Monol/Golem&#41; from his guard. <BR>	Daina the Daina brushed the hair out of her eyes and smiled. <BR>	“Hello, Rocky,” she said warmly.  “Let me in.  If you don’t mind.” <BR>	Rocky the Obelisk immediately opened the gates.  “Yes, Miss Daina.”   <BR>	Daina walked across the courtyard, watching the slaves &#40;the humans&#41; work away.  She noticed one human was not working because he was staring at a female of his type.  She also saw that another one was trying to get close to a Pixie maid that worked at the castle.  She tut-tutted and said “Humans.  Instead of working they stare at women.  Unworthy if you ask me.” <BR>	She used her Flame attack to kill them both, plus the human girl that had been flirting with the guy.  Next she walked into the castle as if she owned the place.  She walked up to the fifth floor, then, hesitating for just a second, went up the rock stairway to the tower. The tower was a place which kids had nightmares about. The tower was a place brave men would rather cry and scream like a baby then even approach.  The tower was Burner’s home.  Once she got up, she opened the door without knocking.  The room was huge, like a gym.  There were pots in the corner, solid steel walls, and heads of each and every type of monster on the wall.  A fire was burning up the Gemini Pots that had been a gift from the humans when Burner faked a peace treaty.  In the middle was a regular office.  A desk, a computer, pencils and pens, papers, chairs for sitting and working and chairs for talking, skeletons, and a sofa.  Daina walked up to the sofa, pushed a couple of skeletons off of it, and sat down, actually, she laid down. <BR>	Burner was sitting in a chair, smiling.   <BR>	“You are late, Daina.” <BR>	“I’m sorry.” <BR>	“Why do you sit like that?  Why do you not knock on the door?  If my servents ever did that I would kill them on the spot.” <BR>	“I am no servent.” <BR>	“We are all servents of the world.  ‘The world is but a stage, and all the people just actors.’-Shakespere. &#40;Or something like that.&#41; <BR>	“I hate it when you speak in riddles, Burner.” <BR>	Burner laughed out loud.   <BR>	“Tell me, Daina, why were you late?” <BR>	“I overslept.”  &#40;Wow.  She’s got guts.&#41; <BR>	“Now let me ask you something.  How did you manage to defeat the humans and their monsters for so long?” Daina asked. <BR> <BR>	Burner chuckled. “Two brains are better then one,” he said.  Then he split in two.  A pure Jell and a pure Phoenix, two bodies.   <BR>	 <BR>Daina nodded.  “Impressive.  A bit gross, actually, a LOT gross, but impressive.” <BR>	 <BR>The Phoenix groaned. “You see,” the evil Phoenix explained, “we cannot live for five minutes being in seperate bodies.  When we are together, we are one mind, one person.” <BR>	 <BR>Daina nodded.  Suddenly, the door opened. A Tiger accompanied by a nervous Mack.  Burner, now one monster again, rose from the chair angrily.  <BR>	 <BR>“Why have you entered my room without knocking?!  If it’s not something extremely important, I’ll make sure you have a slow death!!!” <BR>	 <BR>The Tiger, though injured, was shaking.  Mack was a little scared.  A little scared as in peeing his pants and practically screaming in terror.  <BR>	 <BR>“Uh, sir. This Tiger is the only surviver of the 10th troop.  He stumbled in my sight as me and my friends were keepin incredible watch over the castle.  We saw him a mile off, sir,” Mack choked out. <BR>	 <BR>“Shut up.” Burner started. “Tiger, what is your name?” <BR>	 <BR>“Boo, sir.  A member of the Gar family,” the Tiger wheezed. <BR>	 <BR>“Ah, so, your name is Boo Gar then.  Tell me, Boo Gar, what happened to the tenth troop?” <BR>	 <BR>“Uh, sir, a bunch of monsters killed them.  I saw a Durahan, many Jells, a Priarocks, and some Hengers, sir.” <BR> <BR>Burner’s eyes narrowed into slits as he thought.  Then his eyes lit up.  “Bring me the person who calls himself ‘Jello’,” he cackled. <BR> <BR>Daina’s eyes fluttered open in surprise <I> What could he possibly want with a human? </I> she thought.  Then she remembered who Jello was.  “The PSYCIC one?” she asked.  “If it is, he’s going to come for a price.  He’s not easy to get to.” <BR> <BR>“Yes, I know.” Burner replied. “Once I know the location of the Jells, I’m sending you and some warriors to get rid of them.” <BR> <BR>					TWO HOURS LATER... <BR> <BR>Jello walked into the door.  By his side was a Phoenix, proud and strong.  This Phoenix was a monster that killed Most, &#40;Burner’s second cousin&#41; and was Jello’s bodyguard. <BR> <BR>Burner smiled.  “I suppose you already know that I want you to tell me where and who these monsters that beat the 10th troop are.” <BR> <BR>Jello nodded.  “For a price.” <BR> <BR>“And what shall this price be?” Burner asked. “300,000 Gold, maybe. <BR> <BR>Jello shook his head. “I don’t need money.  We will see what I need after I tell you the information.  The Jells and thier friends are coming this way.” Jello whipped out a map and gave it to Burner.  There were little dots marking the Jells. <BR> <BR>Burner smiled.  “Ah, brave trainer, what shall your prize be?” <BR> <BR>Jello matched Burner’s smile. “I’ll take the Renneded Herb.” <BR> <BR>Burner raised his eyes to meet Jello’s. “Any special reason?” <BR> <BR>“Nope.” <BR> <BR>“Well, here you go.  Use it well.” <BR> <BR>						&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Gengen had been walking all night with his friends, and they were all tired.  Gengen dropped something, then bent down to pick it up.  He heard a twig snap behind him.  He turned around...and there was a human, clutching something in his hand.  He placed that something in Gengen’s hand, and dissapeared. Gengen was astonished.  The Wall Mimic thought he knew this human from somewhere-he somewhat resembled the Jell trainer they met earlier.  He looked down at his hand and gasped.  There-lying in his hand-was the Renneded Herb.  He jumped up to his friends screaming “I got it! I got it! I gooooooooooooottttttttttttttt itttttttttttttt!!!
