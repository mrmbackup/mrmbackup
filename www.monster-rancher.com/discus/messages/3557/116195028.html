 Waking with a start, he looks about, befuddled... and for the first time in a long time, a coherent thought enters his mind. <BR>&#34;Where am I?&#34; <BR>Rising slowly, his shoulder makes a sickening sliding noise, bringing with it more pain. Turning cold gray opticsto the clear cerulean sky, he sees at the corner of his vision, the mountain. His mountain. <BR>Why had he gotten so angry? Why had he been so stupid? ....Why was he asking himself this? <BR>At least he wasn&#39;t cold. <BR>Turning his view away from the frigid passes of his mountain, he rounds the huge boulder he slept behind to see trees. He knew their smell, their feel, their purpose, but treated them like a foreign magic as he touched one for the first time in ages. Backing away from it, expecting some sort of reaction, another memory springs to his cluttered mind. <BR>&#34;Okay, Roji, we cut like this... one, two, one, two.&#34; <BR> <BR>Shaking his head, the ominously familiar voice in the flashback for some reason repulses him. <BR>He turns back to he mountain once more, unsure of what to do. <BR>&#34;Anything is better...&#34; he thinks, as he considers going back. <BR>Snorting, he begins to walk through the forest, pine needles sticking to his scarred feet. Travelling for hours, he comes to a halt, hungry. <BR>A strange sensation this was for him.. <BR>The cold had prevented most feeling. <BR>Looking about, he remembers the deer... <BR>He couldn&#39;t kill again. Surely there must be an alternative. <BR>  <BR>&#34;Okay Roji, thats great! Now, as soon as this branch comes down Ill get you some fruit.&#34; <BR> <BR>Fruit? He knew that branches belonged on trees... but fruit? Mulling it over as he hobbles through the forest, the silence of his thoughts are broken by-- <BR> <BR>&#34;HEY! You there!&#34;

 Yup, length length length, I always gripe about length. <BR> <BR>Either way, you got a good charactor developed here, and you are a superb narrator, just keep at it.
