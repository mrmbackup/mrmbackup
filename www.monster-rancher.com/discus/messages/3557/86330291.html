 &#34;It&#39;s been a year since the glitch opened a doorway between Earth and the Monster Rancher World, known as Tecron.  At first, both worlds were afraid of each other.  In time, the humans and the monsters coexisted.  Monsters came to Earth and humans went to Tecron.  Since then, the society has changed.  Monsters have helped humans with labor, education, and much more.  Schools for children and young monsters were established and &#34;monster-ranching&#34; became the top subject and occupation,&#34; Mrs. Andrews said as she scribbled on the chalk board.  Her Pixie was busily grading papers at her desk.  Justin, a young dark-haired boy sat waiting in excitement.  Today was the first day of his Monster Ranching class.  After his teacher would go over the lessons, the students would all take a test.  Those that pass it would receive a Disc Stone imported from Tecron.  Those that failed had to stay another day or so and retake the test.   <BR>&#34;Are we ready to begin the test?&#34; she asked. <BR>                    &#42; &#42; &#42; <BR>&#34;I got a 80 on the test, dude, what did you get?&#34; Brandon, one of Justin&#39;s friends asked. <BR>&#34;I got a 100, of course,&#34; he replied.  They were waiting in line as the Arrowhead handed out Disc Stones to the students.   <BR>&#34;I want a Dark Dragon!&#34; Brandon exclaimed. <BR>&#34;Not me, I want a Hopper or a Hare, something cute,&#34; Laura said. <BR>&#34;Typical girl,&#34; Brandon teased.  Justin was next to receive his disc.  As the red lobster handed over the disc, tons of monsters raced through Justin&#39;s mind.  He didn&#39;t care what he would get.  No matter what, he&#39;d turn it into a champion.   <BR>     An hour later, the bus transported them to the shrine.  The children were in awe as each disc flashed with brilliant light and revealed its gift.  A Zuum, a Suezo, a Plant, and a Posiedon were a few.  Laura placed her disk down on the altar, a got a yellow cat doll, Mew.   <BR>&#34;Awwwww, it&#39;s so cuuutee,&#34; she smiled.  Brandon was next and unlocked a devastatingly evil-looking Joker. <BR>&#34;Oh man, you are so lucky,&#34; Justin said.  As Brandon and his Joker, Brujah, left the altar, the cocky Ethan approached them.  <BR>&#34;Ha, yes, he has bad luck indeed, Joker&#39;s are infamous for being mutinous and some have even killed their own masters,&#34; he said.   <BR>&#34;Brujah will destroy your monster anytime!&#34; Brandon challenged. <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t waste my time, junior, my Wing Worm and I have more important matters at hand.  However, I look forward to mopping the floor with you at the next tournament,&#34; he walked away. <BR>&#34;I&#39;d just like to give that guy a good beating.  Hey, Justin, what are you waiting for, get your monster,&#34; Brandon said.  He placed his disc on the altar and watched it spin.  A blanket of light surrounded them and faded, revealing Justin&#39;s monster, an Icy Jell.
