No? I can&#39;t say I recoment this... haha, ahahahaha! Fire, take him out and... drop him&#34;. Said Fear, following his joker like laugh again.  Death was afraid, he diddn&#39;t know what he got into, but he just wanted out. <BR>   As the pheonix Picked him up in her tallons death truly fealt the heat from a pheonix, It wassn&#39;t &#34;hot&#34; but it was... Heat. It was hard to explain... or was it just that this pheonxix was specail, like the other two. <BR>  &#34;Heh, I kinda feel sorry for you.  Like I said, kinda. Oh, and by the way, this drop issn&#39;t the most pleasent.&#34;  Said Fire.   <BR>  Death knew this wassn&#39;t gonna be plesant, he had figured that when the pheonix was about to throw him off, he would jump her. <BR>   &#34;Time to let you go!&#34; she said, about to drop him. &#34;Have a nice fa-  Ahhhh!&#34;A small hole apeared in the wing of the pheonix, It was small, but painfull never the less. <BR>   &#34;Better get out of here death!&#34; Said corg. &#34;Let me jump on you and you fly out! hurry!&#34; <BR>  &#34;Wait, issn&#39;t this gonna huuuuuurtttttt!?&#34; Death said before falling off, with corg on his back. <BR>    &#34;Oh, you two are so dead now!&#34; Said Fire, starting to decent after them, rage in here eyes. <BR>   &#34;We had better get going, and fast, NOW!&#34; said corg. <BR>   &#34;I am working on it. I am the one with the 1,000 pount metal heap on my back!&#34; Death stated. <BR>   &#34; Just fly while I shoot at her.&#34; Corg replied <BR>                 ~Down below, in the forest~ <BR> <BR>   &#34;Najik! Najik! Come quick, There is something in the sky!&#34; <BR>  &#34;what is it sheenja?&#34; Najik replied anoyed, he diddn&#39;t like being woke from his naps.  <BR>  &#34;There is a Dragon/hengar, no, wait, A hengars on its back... and its falling... and its being chased by fire!&#34; Sheenja replied. <BR>  &#34;Fire, the black pheonix!? Oh boy, Looks like the dragon could use some help... Sheenja, stay here, I must go and help.&#34; <BR>  &#34;Bu...bu... Najik, thats not fair! I always have to stay.&#34; sheenja pouted. <BR>   &#34;and so it shall forever be.&#34; Najik said with a laugh. <BR> <BR>   ~Now, back to the skys~ <BR> <BR>  &#34;Rahhh!&#34; Fire said, frailing another fireball at them, black in color. This one almost made its mark... almost. <BR>  &#34;Oh god help us now! Death said, trying to avoid being turn into a crispy critter. <BR>  &#34;You are gonna die this time! Ahahah-Owe, not again!&#34; Fire had a antoher small hole in his arm, which looked just as painfull as the one before.   <BR>   Fire looked upp to see a very wise, and old magic up there.  <BR>  &#34;Come back fire! Fear has told me you have had to much fun, we must go.&#34; The magic said. <BR>  &#34;Alright... But you will pay for that!&#34; As fire said that she Fired one of her black fireballs at him, buring him to a crisp. What was left just fell to the ground. <BR>  <BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <BR>Sorry about the short chapter guys, I PROMISE to make it exiting in the next one, just wait... <BR> WHo is this najik, And is fire as strong as she states being?
