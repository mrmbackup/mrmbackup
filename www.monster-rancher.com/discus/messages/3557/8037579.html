<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
&#40;smile&#41; I would like to thank those who answered my questions. I posted a question no more than 5 minutes ago and I am already receiving answers! THANX! Ok....Now look...I want to write a story based on Monster Rancher. I would like it to be about the breeders from around the world. All I need is your breeder&#39;s name and a breif description of yourself and of your preferences in monster types, attacks, breeds....etc. EXAMPLE  <BR> <BR> I am Master Woods. After acheiving the highest ranks in my martial arts, I find life boring at this young age&#40;20&#41;. I recently found one of the mythical &#34;Disc Stones&#34; and I&#39;ve created my first monster. Though I am a man of few words, my actions are just. At first i was alarmed to such a site. But after careful consideration I&#39;ve decided to continue with my monster raising. I have left my old life to experience true life. My ambitions are to become the greatest monster rancher. I&#39;ve seen wonderful monsters from all over and raised quite a few of my own. My quest begins....only the Highest himself knows what my future holds.......  <BR> <BR>I just made this one up but I&#39;ll give a better dexcription to those who want it. I HAVE A VIVID IMAGINATION AND A GIFT TO APPLY IT AS WELL! Please.....join me in the &#34;Quest&#34;.  <BR> <BR> Asked by Master Woods &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Rashi342@aol.com">Rashi342@aol.com</A>&#41; on November 24, 1999 <BR> <BR> <BR>Answers <BR>do you have icq?i would like to join the quest but it would be easier if you had icq  <BR> <BR> Answered by suezoguy &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dpkjell@home.com">dpkjell@home.com</A>&#41; on November 24, 1999.  <BR>                                                 <BR>My name is Miss Carrie. I have been ranching for over 100 years and have yet to become a master breeder. I have beaten two of the M4 but my real goal is to raise one of every type of monster. I have unlocked all but the Zilla and Jill. I prefer raising high intelligence monsters but don&#39;t dislike anything really. Every monster has it&#39;s own strengths and weaknesses. Someday I will raise the perfect monster.  <BR> <BR> Answered by Miss Carrie &#40;<A HREF="mailto:musicality1@earthlink.net">musicality1@earthlink.net</A>&#41; on November 24, 1999.  <BR> <BR>                                                          you may call me grizzlan, i&#39;ve been breeding monsters for upwards of 40 years. My monster of preference has power and intelligence. i have raised many successful pheonixs and tyrants all of whom have made me proud. i have recently uncovered an ancient suit of armor though and engraved inside it was the name kukoshi muso, and it came alive. I have taken it unto myself to train it, and let it make war again... Under controlled circumstances.  <BR> <BR> Answered by grumbly grizzly greg &#40;<A HREF="mailto:grizzlan@aol.com">grizzlan@aol.com</A>&#41;on November 25, 1999.  <BR>                                                   <BR> <BR>I started raising monsters at an early age... on the lost continent. Born too a poor mother I was introduced to the &#34;fights&#34; and found big money could be had... I was known as Lefty, my greatest success came with a dragon that won the Big 4 in FIMBA... after running afoul of local &#34;gaming&#34; orridances I asked master Tseng where I could hideout. He directed me to the &#34;other&#34; continent where ranching was an acceptable means of support to a legitimate business man. I packed my slates and headed off. To throw off &#34;Johnny-Law&#34; I became known as Big Mike... once again I found myself meager and hungry. Along came my Prince Hair and lo and behold I was in the money again... Having not yet reached my true potential I continue to raise world class monsters and gain all the fame stripped away on the &#34;other&#34; continent... my earliest success came in the invitational where I showed those FIMBA bosses just what I had learned. Capo di tutti capo-- boss of bosses! -Big Mike  <BR> <BR> Answered by dan pietro &#40;<A HREF="mailto:no_dan@hotmail.com">no_dan@hotmail.com</A>&#41; on November 25, 1999.  <BR>                                                   <BR> <BR>My name is Asil. My journey began long ago when I recieved a small pouch in the mail. A white pouch with the return address stating simply &#34;Tecmo&#34;. Inside was a beginner&#39;s course in breeding monsters. I began training in earnest, and when the full course became available I knew being a breeder was my destiny. Though many years have passed, and my memory of what living I did before I became a breeder is dim, I have kept that small pouch with me.  <BR> <BR>I spent over two hundred years breeding and training on the lost continent. I worked with many monsters; some to great glory, some to ordinary but fulfilling destinies. Our adventures were many, and I even assisted others in their journies. I freely shared my slates and my expertise with any who asked.  <BR> <BR>One day a terrible event shattered my comfortable world. My slate &#40;a very large and very full slate with all of my accomplishments&#41; crumbled to dust. Dissolute, I wandered aimlessly. I cannot tell you much of the journey, since I had very little heart in any of my actions. <BR> <BR>At long last I heard a rumor of another isle. Not willing to believe, I tried to move on to other careers. One day, though, while I visited the slate market, I saw a publication in a strange language with a gold suezo in chains on the cover. The merchant did not know how the publication had gotten on the shelf. He looked in disbelief at it, and sent my on my way asking only that I remove the strange item. I left and began to peruse the shiny pages. I saw photos of children sleeping with a strange pink and green monster. I saw photos of monster DNA. I saw children playing with monsters. I gathered up my new slate that day and began my journey to this new and strange land of monsters.  <BR> <BR>My arrival was truly akin to a homecoming. I began breeding in earnest, relishing the early, difficult years of poverty and hard work. My new adventures equal any of those of yore, and my current stable of monsters is as varied and talented as any I ever had on the lost continent. I now commit my records to multiple slates, so that the tragedy of my past will never destroy my life again. My only hope is that the peach trees never die!  <BR> <BR> Answered by Lisa Shock  on November 25, 1999.  <BR>                                                   <BR>My name is Bad Asst The Draco Kato. I have no longer have a master. He fell victim to my dragon fire. Now I am the master and the monsters I breed are the same monsters that enslaved my brethren and me. The human monsters shall be my army, my revenge, and my slaves. I have already gathered all the humans from the nearby ranches. The humans&#39; former slaves now serve me as Human Ranchers. Beware humans for Bad Asst the Draco Kato is coming, and the world will never be the same again.  <BR> <BR> Answered by Mr. Simmons &#40;<A HREF="mailto:asim01@hotHATESPAMmail.com">asim01@hotHATESPAMmail.com</A>&#41;on November 25, <BR> 1999.  <BR>                                                   <BR> <BR> my name is Sterling, but most people call me the stradigest becues of my gift to beat any one I have good info on .

In fact he works with Holly &#40;you may recognize her from the FIMBA&#92;IMA meets&#41;. I come from a family of breeders, and spent many summers on my uncles ranch, learning the techniques necessary to be a master rancher. When I turned twenty, I had a fight with my parents, who wanted me to take over the family business of raising riding dinos, and left the farm to start my career as a monster rancher. My uncle gave me a slate that contained the offspring of his prizewinning monsters. I left the far continent to come here and join IMA, where the shrine helped me release the monster my uncle had given from from the slate. The arcane mechanism glowed, and from the silvery light stepped a young Angel, who I named Aphrael. Aphreal and I explored the countryside until we found a place that would make a good ranch. We practiced our combat techniques, and scrimped and saved to afford errantry, but after several months the big day came, and we proceeded to trounce our opponents in the open tournament We impressed the judges so much, that they allowed us to take the IMA tests without spending time and money on the classes. I aced the tests, and was then given another test of seemingly irrelevant questions. However, after they analyzed these questions I was assigned a young woman who would help me raise Aphrael. We returned to my ranch, and began to prepare for the E-class tournament. Recently a dragon landed in ay pasture, and left a package behind. Fortunately I was close enough to Aphrael to prevent her from attacking him on sight. While Colt examined the package, I calmed Aphrael down. In the package were 4 pairs of socks, 3 dozen cookies, a sweater, 2 bottles of multi-vitanims, and a letter. Apparently Aunt Holly is planning on visiting around here, and would like to see me. There have been rumors about a special secret match the master ranchers have been setting up, so I think I know why she is coming. If I&#39;m right, Aphrael and I have to hurry up, and be absolutely ready for the E-class tournament. If we can make it, Aunt Holly will never know what hit her.  <BR> <BR>      -Berge  <BR> <BR> Answered by Berge &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rellis@bigidea.com">rellis@bigidea.com</A>&#41;on November 29, 1999.  <BR>                                                   <BR> <BR> I am Khahad, a illustrator who is skilled with his hands and many other things, yet young. At the age of 14 i am seeking adventure, increasing my skills as a Master Raiser if need be. I have had my companion Tucan Sam at my side ever since i was 6. Sam is a .. you know birdlike animal who talks. We have been through a lot. He talks of tales we had in the past a lot when bored. I have raised monsters such as a cat or dog. And my birdlike friend Tucan Sam. I am counting on raising a monster.. or whatever i will do to be a thrill and so will Sam. I would like to breed anytype of monster which will be thrilling. Attacks... no matter.. maybe intelligent attacks will do. Seeing many common raised monsters maybe i shall start raising again. I hope of achieving many memories throught this and adventure.

 Well, what do you know! Never noticed this thread before. I suppose I simply _have_ to answer it, now. ^_- <BR> <BR>My name is Kurasu Soratobu, and I am a Monster Rancher of many different sorts. At the moment, my greatest thorn-in-the-side, not to mention my greatest rival, is Salazen, a trainer who lives right nearby me. A terrible trainer, he makes sure t oraise all his monsters so they are as evil as him. Of course, this only drives me to raise all my monsters to be good, so we can have the battles of good and evil. So far, good has always triumphed, but unfortunaetly, his training style grows better with each passing day... and each bit he manages to steal from me. Not long ago, he managed to steal the location of the precious golden peaches. I fear for my winning streak! <BR> <BR>The monsters I raise are of many different types, though I seem to have a liking for the monsters no one else likes. Nitons, Gaboos, Monols, and Hoppers... I enjoy showing people that they _can_ be a lot of fun to work with, not to mention gamewinners &#40;what with 20&#43; S-class monsters under my belt, at the moment&#41;. However, I&#39;ve yet to find a monster I _dislike_, other than a boredom with Durahans and Beaclons, after raising six or so in a row.

 I&#39;m Railsback, an old military strategist for the lost Torles Highlands kingdom.  After the king got too big of a head and stopped listening to my advice, I left.  It&#39;s now a crumbling batch of ruins buried beneath the snow that no one alive remembers.  I have survived for over 150 years on a steady diet of Magic Bananas and a few...&#34;special&#34;...peaches.  I knew that I would have several enemies when I left &#34;his majesty&#39;s&#34; service, and so began raising monsters as bodyguards.  I quickly became enamoured of the beasts, and have devoted my potentially-endless life to perfecting each breed into champions with my tactical expertise.

Global Weapons Tech &#40;GWT&#41; insisted that go into early retirement &#39;until needed&#39;. The kiss of death to a career such as mine. It wasn&#39;t that I was doing a bad job. On the contrary, I was too good. So good in fact, that the groups that I help to establish were doing what they could to retain my services. This included making my name well known among the civilian, as well as the politcal sectors. That, in essence denied me the flexibility and freedom of movement necessary to accomplish my objectives. My superiors comissioned me a new name and number. I was granted a very nice chunk of land that they knew would please my personality according to my profile. The only available means of income using that property, turned out to be monster ranching. Now, instead of traning rebels, I train monsters the only way I know how. Although, my methods may appear unorthodox and inferior to other ranchers, I&#39;m maintaining a comfortable living. Perhaps, it&#39;s because I resent being mothballed. Or, it&#39;s because I don&#39;t care anymore. But, I&#39;m not in a hurry to prove myself as the best rancher. I&#39;ve even broken the rules time and time again concerning sexual relations with pixies. Fortunately, assistant &#39;Colt&#39; and I have the same forbidden tastes. It&#39;s highly doubtful that we&#39;ll ever be caught. We&#39;ve seemed to guaranteed the love and loyaty of our pixies, by allowing them books and the types of education legally denied them. They&#39;ve even made some remarkable scientific discoveries that are considered capital offences. For example, 1.&#41; The ability to reestablish the ability procreate in the same fashion as humans. For which we now have to conceal the existance of the additional monsters&#40;?&#41; that we are responsible for. 2.&#41; Pixies who are born in this manner have lifespans comparable to humans. <FONT COLOR="ff0000">From the diary of The Hyena.</FONT>

My first monster was a dino, both of my monsters have made it to B class, but failed to get me past it.  In one of the tourneys I won something called a dragon&#39;s fang.  I plan on combining the two monsters together and using this item, maybe adding a disk that I also won, but please do not tell, it will cost me some extra money for the illegal adding of a extra combo item.  Some day I hope to be one of the greats, like Atries or Sutal.

 Ah the days of by gone yore...I still remember the day when I accidently found a magical disc that when brought to the shrine gained me my first monster. Such fond memories. Immeditely I trained that little Zuum into a strong and reliable monster but with little knowledge in training never managed to go past rank A. Confused and disappointed I left my home of Malaysia and ventured to Singapore leaving my training career behind and left in saddness and my heart in tatters. Colt begged me to relent and reconsider but I had to leave but 1 year later I again had a calling to become a rancher and after searching these woderful archives of knowledge I have managed to become a master rancher only 10 days ago. My most favourite monster at this time is my Omega &#40;Henger/zuum&#41; who only has either Most or Poritoka to face to enter the hall of glory and forever to remembered as the best of the best.

 I am known by many names. Those that have met me in battle know me only as Kali....The Dark One. My tale is one of greed and deception. Several years ago I was a simple Stable Hand on a large FIMBA Ranch. The Rancher ruled the place with a greedy heart and a heavy hand. He cared not for the health and well-being of his charges but only of Money. He willingly sent many monsters into battles with large purses. Sadly most did not make it out. Many of the Monsters housed on the ranch lived in fear of disobeying the Rancher. Only one stood against him. An untamed Naga named Stryker. Named so because no human could lay hands on him without getting clawed or bit. One day, after loosing the rancher a considerably large bet, Stryker was beat almost to death and left in the small woods that surrounded our ranch to die. I stumbled across him purely by accident. In his soul, I saw my own so I hid him and nursed him to health. When the Rancher found out my deed, he was furious. Not long after I ran, taking Stryker with me. The authorities were notifyed and no stone was unturned to find the &#39;kidnapped&#39; monster. It was then that I heard of a new continent with a different set of rules and authorities. I set sail to what would be Stryker and my&#39;s new home.  <BR> <BR>Since then I have been busy building a ranch of my own. My monsters consist mainly of Nagas, but I have taken other types in as well. Our goal is the Final 4 and, though we are new, we are well on our way.

 To those who know me, I am Draco, Draco the Sage.  To my enemies, I am merely Ace.  Ace, for accuracy and speed are my trademarks.  Divinegon, the Fairy Diva, stands by my side, as I lead Age Island to victory.  Where was I?  Oh yes.  My opponents know me as a child, but I am much more &#40;what, you thought I was the Sage for nothing?&#41;.  I am a True Dragyn.  Not of the Monster type, but more.  Intelligent, thousands of years old, and nothing if not powerful.  Nothing can stand in my way, and monsters speak to me.  For over 2000 years I have lain, waiting.  Now, my monsters are strong.  Diva, Ninja, White Mucchi.  Chrono, Irassie, Dogmar.  These and many more are mine.  Truly I am the Master!

 Born to a family of nomads from the Takrama region, I, Khift, yearned for more than the homeless life of my parents. Until several years ago, I have never known what I yearned for, or even why I wanted it. Compared to others in lands more plentiful, our family was still more fulfilling. But I perservered in my wishes.  <BR> <BR>One day, while passing near the border to Kalaragi, an unknown golem came running from the west. Without warning, it crushed the last car, my little sister&#39;s, of our family caravan with it&#39;s powerful fists. It then upturned several more with a mighty heave. Leaping frantically from my car, the 3rd in line, I sprinted towards Kalaragi hoping I wouldn&#39;t be seen. <BR> <BR>An untracked amount of time later, I found myself stumbling through the deep, rank swamps that surrounded the Kalaragi jungle. The sheer terror from the assault had worn off to a degree, although I was still shaking traumatically. Heaving breaths passed through my relatively small frame, and after laying down near a rotten tree trunk I passed out. <BR> <BR>I woke in a daze. There were hordes of mosquitoes covering my weak body. Having lived in the desert my entire life, I didn&#39;t have a clue of what to do. I panicked and ran to the east, or at least that is where I now believe I ran. In my terror I hadn&#39;t checked. Seeing a small, clear spring, I leaped in it without hesitation. When I returned to the surface, I had noticed that the cloud of mosquitoes had left me, and after reliving the events mentally, I realized that the horrible drone had stopped only a short time after I had began to run, but again, in my panic, I kept on running heedlessly. <BR> <BR>It was then that I took a view of my surroundings. No longer was I in the swamps, but instead I was in the thick of the actual jungle. Once again, I laid down beside the spring to sleep. When I woke, I was ravenous, but food was not far in the plentiful jungle. A pair of mangoes dangled from a nearby tree. I quickly snatched these and consumed the sweet fruit, only to hear a voice from behind the trees. <BR> <BR>&#34;Do you realize what you have just done?&#34; The voice asked. It sounded elderly and male. <BR> <BR>My fear had returned, and having no idea of whether this stranger was held ill - feelings towards me, my body stiffened. I tried to run, but I couldn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>&#34;I asked a question, and when I do such I expect an answer, young man.&#34; <BR> <BR>Appearing from the trees was an old man in a robe carrying a gnarled old staff. <BR> <BR>&#34;.... N-no...&#34; I managed to squeak out. <BR> <BR>&#34;Then soon enough you will. But remember this: You have killed a man, and a great one at that.&#34; With no more words, he hobbled back to where he came from. <BR> <BR>For a week or so I wandered without purpose, finding fruit in the trees, but none as sweet as those mangoes. Eventually, I found my way to a wide, open pasture with a large building floating out towards the side of the ocean. Recognizing it immediately from the tales my older brothers had told me, I knew it was the &#39;Shrine&#39;. I saw a girl hesitating at the side of the forest. Wearing a large, bejeweled brooch, I recognized her as a Tochikan child. I approached her, asking if she would help me get a monster from the shrine, we soon began a conversation. <BR> <BR>And the rest you already know. <BR> <BR>&#40;60 Years Later&#41; <BR> <BR>I continue to train my monsters, watching them pass by my eyes with lifespans measured in weeks. Fleria, the Tochikan girl, has grown old and hasn&#39;t much life yet. But I have not. I now know what the man meant. According to Kalaragi legend, there was once a tree the held &#39;Fruits of Eden&#39;, allowing for eternal life. That tree had the life-span of a normal tree, and bore only two fruits.  <BR>When one fruit was consumed, the other would drop and become part of the ground, and when the tree would die that fruit would sprout. <BR> <BR>I ate both fruits. <BR> <BR>Nonetheless, I still perservered although I knew I had slain a legend. My Hares passed by my eyes and each week seemed a day to my soul. I still try to beat the legendary Ragnarox. But that will forever stay in my mind.

 Some of you may know me a little from the gamefaqs board.I want to put in a description of myself for you all.I know noone will actually read this,but I felt like putting it in anyway.After reading all of your descriptions,I had to.They are all very good and creative.Anyways,here&#39;s my story. <BR> <BR>I am Andy Derintaro.You can just call me Boots.I am a great monster tamer &#40;if I do say so myself&#41;even though I am merely 13 years old.Here is the tale that will reveal my life,and with it my deepest and darkest secrets. <BR> <BR>Although I have lived in Torles all my life,I thought it to be surprisingly cold when I reached the outscirts of our small mountain valley home.My hands had gone numb ours ago,but,since I was used to the extreme cold,I still had a lot of strenghth left in them. <BR>When I saw the huge boulder,I immediately moved it out of the way with the help of my brother,Matthew.When the boulder finally rolled aside,Matthew and I gasped.Behind the boulder was a giant building!We were facing the back of it,so we ran around it until. We found an unusually small door. <BR>&#34;Wow....it looks like a giant snowman!&#34;I heard Matthew mutter to himself. <BR>I grinned.Then I asked the one question that I have always regretted to even think about...&#34;Wanna go check it out?&#34; <BR>This horrible,yet wonderful,event happened when I was 6,so I had little knowledge.For this reason, I instantaneously raced Matthew to see who would be the first to get inside. <BR>As soon as we set foot in the snowan building,the door way closed up.For a few seconds,we were in total darkness.Then lights came on from out of nowhere.We realized that we were inside a giant maze!We started walking down every corridor.Finally,when we were about to give up,I heard a faint hum.Another passageway appeared from out of nowhere!Matthew and I were both very curious by now as to what was down that hall.We looked at eachother and decided a fate which was to change the rest of our lives.At the end of the passage,we found a single,unusual footprint. <BR>I touched the footprint,and it started glowing blue. <BR>Matthew and I&#40;I like saying that&#41;were petrified,for at the same moment I touched the footprint,a horrible screeching sounded,and a gigantic monster appeared.The monster roared and swung its giant hand at us. <BR>We then realized...this monster looked like the building. <BR>&#34;Uh-oh....I think we went into his house without asking...&#34;Matthew managed to croak out. <BR>The monster then obviously got tired of us ignoring it,so it swatted at my little brother. <BR>Matthew went flying against a wall,and was knocked unconscious. <BR>&#34;Y...yo....you...YOU ALMOST KILLED MY BROTHER!!!&#34;I screamed. <BR>Then came the most miraculous moment of my life. <BR>I surged with energy,and fired a giant blast that blew a hole clean through the monsters horrible bulk. <BR>The monster instantly crumpled down in a heap. <BR>I then saw yet another miraculous thing happen...the monster dissolved into nothing,leaving a pair of boots.I put the boots on and felt a strange tingling course itself through my body.I then walked over to the unconscious form of my brother.I picked up Matthew and walked out into the cold outside.As soon as we returned home,my sobbing parents grabbed us two boys and hugged us.My father then noticed my boots and his eyes went wide,&#34;Where...did you...get...those...boots....?&#34; <BR>&#34;I found them inside a big building shaped like a snowman.&#34;I replied. <BR>While my mother took Matthew to the hospital&#40;he had a few small cuts on his head&#41;,my father took me to the local shrine.He babbled something to the priest,and,before I knew it,started to take my boots off. <BR>He kept muttering somthing that he thought noone would hear,but I heard him loud and clear, &#34;I knew I&#39;d find them.....I knew this day would come...&#34;. <BR>When he finally suceeded in ripping my boots off my stubbornly big feet,he handed them to the priest and told him to take me to show me &#34;the regeneration&#34;.Now,as I mentioned before,I was only six,so I had no clue what &#34;regeneration&#34; meant.Anyway,the priest gently took my hand and brought me into a large room with four statues surrounding a giant circular tile on the floor. <BR>He took something off of one of the many shelves in the back of the room.It was a round,flat disc with strange markings on it.He then told me everything about being a monster rancher,mystery discs,monsters,tournaments,and everything else about being a monster rancher you can think of. <BR>Finally,after all the explanations,I asked the question that had been bugging me since he started explaining things to me, &#34;What do my big boots have to do with monsters?&#34; <BR>&#34;These boots are used as a secret seasoning.By using these boots,you can recieve your very own monster.&#34;The priest explained. <BR>My eyes twinkled.The grin I had put on when we started our conversation widened even further.I almost forgot to take a breath.I was so overjoyed!!! <BR>We then went through the process of making a monster.After I said &#34;unlock&#34;like the priest told me to,white sparks flew out of the disc.&#34;NOW!!!!&#34;,the priest screamed.With that one word,I kissed the pair of boots and flung them at the sparks. <BR>The of the boots collided with the sparks,but the other bounced off and hit me in the chest.Then,a miraculous thing occured yet again in my life...the boot that hit me went into my body.It went straight through me chest,and it probably implanted itself in my heart.That&#39;s how I recieved the nickname Boots. <BR>Anyway,while all of that was happening,the sparks took on a shape.It looked sort of like a snowman.The glow faded,and there,sitting on the platform,was my new baby monster.......a Jill. <BR> <BR>Because of the incident that happened that day with the boots,Archemides&#40;my Jill&#41;and I have a special connection.It&#39;s almost as if we can read eachothers&#39; minds.He does everything that I do,and I do him.It&#39;s very unusual. <BR> <BR>Archemides and I then returrned home with my father.When we got there,another one of my life&#39;s twists and turns happened to be waiting for us. <BR>My mother was in the kitchen sobbing.I couldn&#39;t find Matthew anywhere. <BR>&#34;Mom,where&#39;s Matthew?&#34;I asked.With that she sobbed even louder. <BR>She then unwillingly replied <BR>&#34;Andy honey...he...he&#39;s....he&#39;s gone...&#34;. <BR>&#34;No...no....NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!&#34;I screamed.I then ran out of the house and up the clock tower in the center of our village. <BR>The clock tower was only about a half of a mile away from our house.Plus,with all the major events happening in this one day,you would think I would want to go home and be with my parents.But noooooo....I had to stay up in the clock tower. <BR> <BR>I got up the next morning and caught a scent of something burning.Archemides was lying right beside me,sleeping like the baby he was.I got up,looked out off the tower&#39;s balcony,and stiffened in shock automatically. <BR>The whole town had been burnt down to the ground. <BR>&#34;....&#34;I was completely speechless.I was horrified.Not only had the whole town burnt down,but all the people with it.You could see the gruesome skeletons of everyone in the village.By this time,Archemides was standing next to me,gaping at the horrors that he saw.We couldn&#39;t stay in the village.There was no shelter and no food.We had to go to another city,town,or village. <BR>But the nearest one was still very far away. <BR>So we headed for an unknown destination.Before we departed,however,we built memorials for every single citizen.Although we made them all very nice,we decorated Matthew&#39;s gravestone more elaborately then the rest.I loved my brother very dearly,and I will never forget him. <BR>Then,with a sad heart but a new hope for a better time,I departed from the town I have&#40;excuse me...HAD&#41;lived in for my whole life with the only family I had...Archemides. <BR> <BR>We eventually found a ranch,and,luckily,from the small amount of cash I had found in the wreckage of my home,bought it and registered myself as a monster rancher.I have been working hard since then.Archemides is still going strong,and we are working on getting his name into the hall of fame. <BR>We&#39;re going to do it,I know it.Matthew&#39;s spirit will always be with us,cheering us on in the hard times until those times become good. <BR>             Sincerely, <BR>                 Boots <BR> <BR> <BR>I hope you liked my story.It was the best I could think of.Sorry its so long,but it&#39;s not like I could fit all that in one paragraph!I&#39;d like comments,good or bad.I wanna know what you think. <BR>Thanx for readin!!!!

 Hello.  My name is Alai.  I am 15, and starting my first ranch.  I have been tought to raise monsters by my parents here in Age.  They let me have 2 of their retired monsters for my new coaches knowing I would pick my 2 best friends, Asyura, a champion Zan with Monol blood in his veins, and RiceCake, a Mocchi.  My, no our, first monster is Akuma, an albino Suezo who already shows great psychic promise although he is only one month old.  As for my assistant, she is an attractive young girl named Mamica about my age with, get this long hair that is naturally light blue!  Contrary to popular belief I did not only choose her for looks &#40;but that helped...&#41;.  she was the only female assistant I interviewed whose &#34;experience&#34; didn&#39;t consist of floating to one ranch after another and leaving it in poverty.  the most outstanding thing on our nicely located ranch&#40;I love connections&#41; is me.  I have admired the magical powers of monsters since my youth.  through training that got me ridiculed for a while, lately I have been able to replicate, at any level&#40;excepting a rather high top limit&#41; the blaze wall attack of galis!  Other powers are shaky but will soon come to be as second nature to me.  Well maybe I&#39;ll write more later, it is bedtime and Mamica is waiting&#40;but that&#39;s another story&#41;.....

 ooh, story, I wanna be in it! ok here I go: <BR> <BR>I&#39;m Mewger. Abandoned by my family at 5, I&#39;ve grown up with naught but WildSaurians for support. I don&#39;t understand humans well, as I do not feel I belong with them, but I try very hard to get along. For 9 years I lived with the tribe of the Saurians, befriending them. It was just a year ago that I heard of raising monsters, and I was very into the idea. I admired the Saurians much, and always wanted one for myself, but I knew they were Wild, I would leave them be. One day, when we were raiding some poor trainer&#39;s ranch, when I stumbled upon a disc-like object. Picking it up, I tried to figure out what it was. I took it with me, and treasured it.  <BR>About a month later, I had gathered the courage to enter the human town. The Saurians had seemed sad to see me go, and I knew in my heart that I would probably not see them again. The last gift I recieved from them was an emerald green scale, a trinket, to show how that they cared. I almost cried at the fact that they loved me more than my family, but that was how it was.  <BR>Now, it&#39;s about 3 years later. I have my own ranch, and the Black Saurian that disc created, Nightshade, is my best and most trusted monster. We feel we can do anything together. We can. <BR>&#40;I think you can tell I like Zuums, and I like most of their attacks, although, I ALWAYS go for pow over int, in any monster. never did like int types, they seem weak to me...&#41;

 Hello.  My name is Leon.  I was orphaned at age 8  <BR>by a pack of feral Tiger monsters, but that was 16  <BR>years ago.  I now live on my ranch with my  <BR>assistant, Holly, whose parents named her after  <BR>the legendary breeder&#39;s assistant immortalized in  <BR>MR1.  I began raising monsters at the age of  <BR>fifteen.  Holly was the same age when she was  <BR>assigned to me.  I speciallize in breeding Pixie,  <BR>Monol, and Doodle monsters, and have recently  <BR>taken up a Dragon. <BR> <BR>FIMBA would shut me down and revoke my breeders  <BR>liscence in an instant if they knew I was raising  <BR>six monsters at once, but I won&#39;t say anything if  <BR>you don&#39;t. <BR> <BR>I always carry a pair of daggers with me, since  <BR>the region I live in is infested with feral  <BR>monsters.  Though I hate hurting, let alone  <BR>killing, monsters, I will if my life, Holly&#39;s, or  <BR>the lives of any of my monsters are threatened.  I  <BR>often train with my monsters, since I don&#39;t expect  <BR>anything from them that I wouldn&#39;t do myself. <BR> <BR>Holly owns a Velvet.  Though I no longer fear  <BR>Tigers like I used to, me and Velvet are not  <BR>exactly friends.  I think he&#39;s jealous of me, and  <BR>he&#39;s extremely protective of Holly.  I know she&#39;s  <BR>in good hands while I&#39;m not around, as long as  <BR>Velvet is by her side. <BR> <BR>I am currently on a quest, with my Mint, Krysta;  <BR>my Monol, Wally; and my Doodle, who I named  <BR>Squiggly Guy.  We are searching the ancient ruins  <BR>of Reno for the legendary Golden Peach, whose  <BR>juices are a key ingredient in the medicine needed  <BR>to cure Holly&#39;s heart disease.  She has been  <BR>suffering for two years, and it pains me to see  <BR>her so.   <BR> <BR>A man named Rick is with us.  He seeks a peach for  <BR>his wife, who, as strange as it may seem, is an  <BR>Angel monster.  He gets her one each year to keep  <BR>her alive.  She and Holly are currently at his  <BR>house, both growing weaker with each day.  I only  <BR>hope we find the peaches before it&#39;s too late.  If  <BR>I were to lose her....

Here&#39;s two for the fire. I&#39;m trying to make it short, but neat so u got alot to work with. <BR> <BR>here i go for creepy character: <BR> <BR>  &#34;I don&#39;t know what i am. monster, human, something else? i have seen these &#39;monsters&#39; battle, and i have seen how these &#39;humans&#39; live. I do many things humans cannot, yet i look so much like them. Where is the line drawn? <BR>  &#34;I remember a time long ago. An ancient civilization. There was a king. he wore a mask, the mask of the moon...&#34; <BR>  He stands tall. His long white hair flowing back like a waterfall. His red trenchcoat stands open over his body, which is entirely wrapped in black leather clothes. All he has is his staff, carved with runes that seem to move, never readable. An ancient to this planet, but new to this world that has taken root, he is lost. Standing above the town of Gandrae, he prepares to enter. Will he find his past? Or his future? All he knows is this: &#34;My name is Vega.&#34; <BR> <BR>now for my happily stupid character: <BR> <BR>  Gandrae Town: <BR>  &#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea,&#34; said Sprig, his long, furry green ears twitching. His fluffy round tail swished toughtfully. That&#39;s Kajima for you, he thought, predictable as a clock. and like a clock he goes &#34;cuckoo&#34; every now and then. A twelve year old clock with long hair, shorts, a tee shirt and more brains than he let on about. <BR>  &#34;I think it&#39;s a great idea!&#34; said Kajima. <BR>  Sprig looked at catapult. <BR>  &#34;I really don&#39;t think launching rocks at &#39;enemy&#39; ranches is good, much less legal,&#34; said Sprig. <BR>  &#34;We&#39;ll win more money, aren&#39;t you Hares all for money?&#34; <BR>  &#34;Not all of us are like that one. Besides, he was just an ordinary hare, I&#39;m a Celeris,&#34; said Sprig proudly. But Kajima wasn&#39;t listening. <BR>  &#34;Fire one-&#34; <BR>  Several loud noises ensued as Breeze smacked Kajima with her kendo stick. Good thing she&#39;s here, other wise who knows what would happen? thought Sprig with a sigh. <BR>  &#34;Owie!&#34; <BR>  &#34;Shouldn&#39;t you be training Sprig, not making little toys?&#34; asked Breeze, looking disdainfully down on the catapult, which was made of twigs and twine, her light blue hair drifting across her sweatshirt, which matched her hair. She kicked the toy and watched as it feebly launced a small pebble a few feet. <BR>  &#34;Sixteen year-olds are all evil!&#34; Kajima proclaimed to the world in general. <BR>  &#34;Is that so?&#34; asked another girl in a silky black dress, various silver pendants jingling as she firmly planted herself on Kajima and wrapped her arm around Kajima.&#34;Even me,&#34; <BR>  &#34;Iyessa!&#34; exclaimed Breeze, blushing at Iyessa&#39;s open affection towards her charge. Somewhere in the back of her mind, a voice was screaming &#34;he&#39;s mine!&#34; <BR>  &#34;Oh, hi, Breeze,&#34; said Iyessa, smiling smugly. <BR>  Sparks flew between their two gazes. <BR>  &#34;So it&#39;s gonna be one of <I>those</I> days...&#34; sighed Sprig and Kajima together. <BR> <BR>And that&#39;s all for now! I gotta post my own fiction!

 Well, i guess i&#39;ll join in on this too. Here&#39;s my profile. My real name is Ben Eclipse, a member of an infamous family on Age Island. I&#39;m kinda a skitzo, I have two sides, one goofy and harmless, and one violent. Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean i&#39;m a bad breeder, even though my monsters have never competed and won against Canute. My past remains a mystery, even to my assitant, Holly. Currently, i&#39;m unenployed, having my breeder liscence tooken away and my monsters put in a foster breeder program. I was accused of using illegal items on another breeders monster &#40; i didn&#39;t do it!!!!&#41;. But I  plan to be a come back.

 My name? I do not have a name of my own, only ones that were forced upon me by my superiors. You may call me Nasae, Naga, beast, snake, which ever you like.  <BR> <BR>I am.. different from the rest, born into a wild pack of Naga, who were then attacked by Moo&#39;s forces as an effort to add to the ranks. I was a mere hatchling then, and was altered through various surgery.  <BR> <BR>I am advanced now, lacking arm or back frills, the spike upon my tail, and the spikes upon my shoulders. I have advanced claws with four fingers save three, amongst other things.  <BR> <BR>I grew up among Moo&#39;s forces but quickly deserted them. I was then found and claimed by my Master who treated me badly, and found it amusing to experiment upon me. My Master was quite the mad scientist. He grafted the wings of a dragon onto my body so that I may now fly, and injected various monster DNA into me to make a chimera of sorts.  <BR> <BR>I can fly, teleport, spit acid, change form, and.. I cannot die. I am constantly reborn whenever I am killed, as I am linked to my master. However, as &#39;wonderful&#39; a man as my Master sounds, I cannot stand him, so.. I simply ran away.  <BR> <BR>I detest the fact that humans look down upon me and my bretheren, so.. I fight for our freedom. I have killed both humans and monsters, and with relish.. devoured them. I believe it makes me stronger, not to mention it tastes &#42;great&#42;.  <BR> <BR>To all of my bretheren who are enslaved today, I urge you to rise up against the humans you call Master, be you happy or otherwise. There is no reason why we should play servant to them, we are equals if not superior.  <BR> <BR>I do not propose a mission of peace, or war. I simply propose common sense. <BR> <BR>&#40; Eheh. o.o First post, woot. Tell me what you think? I&#39;ve been role playing this character for five years now, and I&#39;m contemplating writing a story. So, eh.. opinions? &#41;

 You still taking? I would love to be in a fic of yours!  <BR> <BR>My name is Brick. No real name, just... Brick. I found my first pancho working at a shrine. I started working at the shrine because I needed money. I don&#39;t know anything about where I came from, only that I awoke one day in Kalaragi and ended up living in Brillia. Day after day, lugging disks into the slots. But it was all worth it to see the happy face on the new owner of a monster. However, some ranchers were picky, and I had to find another disk for them. I usually slept at the shrine, because many monsters had been regenerated and not taken. I loved them all, but none suited me right. I&#39;d give some away to people who wanted monsters with experience, or people with kind hearts. One day, the shrine keeper, the one who knew the words to unlock the monsters, came to me and said: &#34;You have done me great service. You may choose one disk and unlock it.&#34; I chose the disk in the corner of the shrine, and unlocked it. It was a pancho, but the second it appeared, it clamped it&#39;s pumpkin shut and wouldn&#39;t let anybody in. &#34;Oh... You might not want that one...&#34; the shrine keeper said. &#34;Very timid. Not for beginners.&#34; I protested, and at first he would not agree, but I wouldn&#39;t give up. I got to take him home, but I had to carry him all the way, seeing as he refused to come out of the pumpkin. <BR> <BR>Yes, we eventually made friends, but I cannot tell you how it happened, I&#39;m saving it for my own fan fic. Oh, and just to clarify, I&#39;m a female, many people get that wrong... XP

 How about this- <BR> <BR>My name is Redge, son of Dadgius Mor &#40;Dadge.&#41; I became a Lab apprentice at the age of twelve, working alongside my father for five years. I am a master of freezing, combining and analyzing. But no more than a week ago my father was murdered by the mysterious King Ape. Now I am seventeen, on a quest to find King Ape and avenge my father&#39;s untimely death. I will cross the scorching heats of the Mandy desert, the fatal blizzards of the Papas region, to reach the Parepare jungle, said to be the home of King Ape, dominator of the Parepare jungle. <BR> <BR>By Nimrook.

 My name is Vega, Vincent Vega.  I am sure most of you are asking yourself.  &#34;Did&#39;nt you die in the bathroom?&#34;  And I answer &#34; No, that was my twin brother.&#34;  I let him take the fall.  I realized after my date with Mia, and the holdup in the coffee shop, that I needed a change in direction.  I decided to raize monsters.  I found this nifty little disc that contained a naga.  The critter was white and gold.  I had another disc also with a naga, and this one was black as night.  I raized them both with marginal sucess.  I traveled to the market and found a dino.  I raised the dino, but it never went to the top.  So I went upon a journey.  I found every disc imagineable.  I even bought a few, until the monster of my dreams was borne, and I called him Busta.  Busta was a hare, and quite evil.  In fact his breed was called Evil Hare, and after the way I treated my brother.  Well it was fitting.  Busta went far, and earned me a lot of fame.  One day while going out to check on Busta, a fool came around the hut and fired from a mac-10.  Busta took the shells.  He died.  I gave Holly the keys to my house in the FIMBA area nad headed to the other island.  There I met a girl named Colt.  We did not get along at first.  I wanted to make friends with Marcellos Wallace, and shoot her my self, but then I stopped.  I left, I went to town and waited.  I drank alot of the money that I had earned from Busta.  I then returned to my ranch, and there was Colt.  We discovered a new breed of monster...Kato.  This one also fit my personallity.  We went far and opened the greatest monster of my time...Joker.  This was my first IMA champion.  Time passed I got older.  Wallace&#39;s gang once again found me.  Once again I ran.  This time I took with me a mysterious liquid and a disc stone that I had never unlocked.  I also had some disc stones that I could not read.  After taking the mysterious liquid I looked in the mirror...I was young goofy looking elf-thing.  I was younger.  I went to training school, and ran away, and ended up in Torble.  There I met a tree, and had A new monster.  The Dark Antlan.  Now, I do not know how, but Mr. Wallace found me again.  So I&#39;m joining the Circus...

 If you are still taking, I&#39;m in. <BR> <BR>The people call me the Phantom Ninja.  I have long since forgotten my real name.  As far back as I can remember, I have had no family and lived on the streets.  I was constantly made fun of by others, and sometimes they had their monsters attack me just because they felt like it.  Through this, I learned to fight just as well as a monster could, a skill that funded my first ranch.  When I wagered against a famous breeder that I could defeat his durahan in a fight, he foolishly accepted.  I managed to take it out easily enough.  Now, I use my fighting skills to train monsters without any equipment, randomly blowing through IMA, FIMBA, and Age Island, still having no true home.  The monsters that I prefer to train are Raidens, Gaboos, Galis, and Hengers.

 My name is Lovrina. I worked with many assistants. I aced my breeders exam. Then the cute  IMA receptionist then asked me a series of 10 questions. I answered them. Then the IMA chairman came along and introducd me to my first assistant, Coltia&#40;otherwise known as IMA Trainer Assistant 10114&#41;. We got me a hopper, which i named after her. He dug up  a hot spring  after a while and Colt got in her swimsuit and jumped in. I was astounded by her cuteness. To think that she had something under that red shirt and white sleeves... I thought that he wouldn&#39;t make it in a battle, but ironically he got us to the two continent meet. I asked her about her rival. Colt said that  Holly is the most popular female trainer. 4 years later, he died. Instead of a red dress, Colt wore a suit.
