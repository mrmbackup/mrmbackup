 The army progressed on. Morality had fallen and money was running low. They had to do something. <BR> <BR>Darkness stood over a small pile of gold with his council. &#34;What are we going to do? We need some way to get some more gold. We can&#39;t afford to keep on going like this!&#34; <BR> <BR>Sensing his leader&#39;s despair, Lynx took the initiative. &#34;Why dont we enter the tournaments, my lord? Even in our current age of chaos and ruins, the AFI association still manages to hold official matches. There are also many unofficial matches that award the winner unimaginable amounts of gold.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Bushi-Do pondered this for a moment. Then he spoke. &#34;Let&#39;s do it.&#34; <BR> <BR>------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>A tall suit of jet black armor, four VERY menacing Durahans and a Henger walked the streets of Paskale, the capital of Rewoq&#40;Second area from the bottom of the world. From the bttom to the top, it is Bazick, Rewoq, Thekiv, Isit. Isit is where X-Blitz resides.&#41; <BR> <BR>Darkness walked up the the AFI counter.  <BR> <BR>&#34;May I help you sir?&#34; inquired the youthful worker on duty. <BR> <BR>&#34;We&#39;d like to sign up for the E,D,C,B,A, and S class tournaments today. Lynx will take the A class tournament, Inferno the B class, Nightstalker the C class, Tsapkiro the D class, and Armada the E class.&#34; He pointed to each as he spoke.  <BR> <BR>&#34;yes sir, right away sir.&#34; The helpful intern snapped to attention and registered each. &#34;The E class tournament starts in five minutes. Each tournament will take approximately one hour. Good Luck!&#34; <BR> <BR>The small group hurried off to the coliseum and sat down in the competitors booth. Suddenly, a small podium appeared. A young woman came out of nowhere and spoke into a megaphone. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome to the event you&#39;ve all been waiting for! Begginers and up and comers participate in this display of young talent! The E class official tournament starts NOW!!&#34; <BR> <BR>The crowd roared as a scorecard flashed on the giant main screen with the six E class competitor&#39;s names. Armada was first up against a Garu named Leo. <BR> <BR>&#34;Good Luck,&#34; whispered Lynx. Armada smiled and walked out onto the battlefield as Leo started doing backflips. <BR> <BR>&#34;1..2..3..START!&#34; <BR> <BR>Leo jumped forward and attempted an uppercut, fist full of blazing fire. Armada simply opened his hand and exposed the palm to Leo. He then proceeded to slap Leo around a couple of times. Then, he punched Leo right in face, making a meaty &#34;THUD&#34; sound. <BR> <BR>The announcer and the rest of the crowd looked on in shock. &#34;um..and the winner is..Armada!...?&#34; <BR> <BR>Armada kept on dominating in his battles and won the E class title, plus a &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; of a lot of gold. By now the crowd was fully into it and roaring like never before. <BR> <BR>&#34;It is time for the D class tournament! Midlevel monsters and young prodigies make up this class! Who will win? Only the future can tell!&#34; <BR> <BR>Darkness looked at Tsapkiro. &#34;Your turn.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>-I realize this is a short chapter, but i have no time. Not that any of you are here to post anymore :&#40;
