 A solitary figure was standing still in the strong evening wind.  Its long blonde hair was completely straight and the wind blew it into a long tail behind the figures head. The figure was clad in red trousers, long black boots with gold rims, a red t-shirt that hung tightly to the figures muscular chest and a long white cape.  All in all, the figure just reeked of wealth and prestige.  Despite the force of the wind it was a very warm afternoon in mid-July.  The figure was on a ranch of some kind, but it was different from a regular ranch.  It was a mass ranch. <BR> <BR>Mass ranches were by no means common but were definitely appearing more and more as people made lots of money off their prized monsters.  Mass ranches were like the regular kind except that instead of one barn and one training area, they had many barns and many areas to build up stats.  It was intended that richer trainers could raise a lot of monsters in one go.  Many trainers kept more than one monster on the ranch at one time but rarely did they raise more than one at a time.  Mass ranchers could be raising 20 or even 30 monsters in one go with the aid of helpers. <BR> <BR>The figure looked to the East with eyes that seemed to rip through the air.  He reached down to his neck and pulled a single whistle from underneath his t-shirt.  He gave the whistle three long blows, a short blow and then a further long blow then dropped the whistle again.  After a few seconds a huge dragon was landing beside him.   <BR> <BR>It was purple, mostly anyway.  A deep purple that was definately due to a sub-breed of naga or gitan. Its body was smooth despite its harsh scales and murderous talons.  The Dragon landed with pinpoint accuracy and bowed its head before the white caped man.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Well done Pyros, quicker than ever, how are you feeling today?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Very well master, I got over the sickness I had yesterday and look, the slash marks from the battle are healed completely.&#34; The dragon raised one side of its body to reveal its stomach, there was a large scratch across it but it was healing. <BR> <BR>&#34;Very good, Pyros we are going to the second farm directly to the East.  There is a new recruit there for us.&#34;  The man said as he hopped onto the dragon&#39;s neck with a leg either side of the long neck. <BR> <BR>At that point a man in a long white lab coat came running towards Pyros and his master.  The man was holding onto a collection of clipboards and a long scroll of printed-paper.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Boss, we are having some minor difficulties.  A few of the reluctant monsters have been behaving in that way again when we try to put the diamond on them.  We have about five now.&#34; The scientist yelled up to his boss. <BR> <BR>&#34;Very well, just continue with what you are doing, ill sort it out when we return from the young Namis&#39;s ranch.  Then we will have one more test subject, a strong one, to try the diamonds on.&#34; with that the man gave a tiny kick to the dragons thick side and it rose into the air flapping its wings.  <BR> <BR>Namis was with Leo in the fields surrounding his ranch when the two got there.  Him and Leo both watched in amazement as a huge purple shape approached in the distance.  As it got closer they could tell it was a dragon and as it got closer still it revealed itself to have a passenger.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Wow! Doesn&#39;t it look strong Leo?&#34; Namis said in awe of the trainer who could make this beautiful yet monstrous beast. <BR> <BR>Neither Pyro or its master spotted the two in the long grass of the field and headed on straight to the ranch. From where they were they could see the dragon landing at their ranch and Namis ran to meet the mysterious visitor. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey! How can I help you?&#34; Namis shouted whilst he was still twelve feet away and running towards them.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Hello, is this Namis&#39;s ranch? I have a proposition.  My name is Lord Wolfgang Restivis..&#34; <BR>Before he could continue, Namis chipped in with <BR> <BR>&#34;How can I help you Lord Restivis?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Please, call me Wolfgang, you can help me by listening&#34; Wolfgangs harsh tone took Namis by surprise and he must have sensed it because he instantly lowered it again. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am currently on a campaign, well in fact more of a crusade, I am searching for the greater good if that makes sense to you. You must understand that although my demands may seem a lot, in the overall scheme of things it is not a lot to ask.&#34; <BR> <BR>Pyros grunted heavily at this point sending a thick spiral of smoke into the air.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I need your monster Namis.  He has been well trained and we need him for our crusade. I realise it will be hard to give him up which is why ill give you twenty four hours to say goodbye.&#34; Wolfgang continued. <BR> <BR>&#34;What!? I can&#39;t give you Leo, he&#39;s mine and I raised him from birth. What is it that you are crusading for anyway?&#34; Namis said in shock. <BR> <BR>Wolfgang did not become angry at this.  He reached into a large purple belt pack and pulled out what looked like a monster disk.  On closer inspection it was just a circle of rock but it had been smoothed down and inscribed with intricate details. On the edge of the circle was the picture of a man, non-descript but still baring a few resemblances to Wolfgang. Below him were many tiny monsters all looking at the figure and in poses of respect, admiration and loving.   <BR> <BR>&#34;I found this at the ruins of a distant jungle, very few parties go as deep as me and Pyros did but we eventually found this temple behind a deep set of vines.  Pyros went in and came back with news the temple was completely empty except for this stone.  It depicts my destiny to rule all these monsters.&#34; Wolfgang said and somehow made it seem incredibly persuasive. <BR> <BR>Namis almost thought about handing Leo over for a split second before reverting to his past attitude.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Well I apologise greatly Wolfgang but I am afraid that neither me or Leo are interested in this idea. Thank you very much though it is a great honour to be picked for this let me assure you.&#34; <BR> <BR>It was not until Namis had finished speaking that Wolfgang allowed himself to get angry.  He did not go red in the face, he did not shout, he simply tensed a little and his hands clenched into fists down by his waist.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I must suggest you reconsider, you will not be left uncompensated, I will pay you all the money you have already spent on this monster and then more than enough for the next five monsters.&#34; Wolfgang said with a slightly harsher tone. <BR> <BR>&#34;Like I said, I&#39;m afraid I am not intereste...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Then prepare to battle!&#34; Wolfgang shouted. <BR> <BR>Pyros rose up to his full height and swung a massive claw at Namis.  Namis leapt backwards and landed on the floor. <BR> <BR>&#34;What the hell are you doing!?&#34; He screamed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Getting what I came for!&#34; Wolfgang screamed back. <BR> <BR>Pyros launched forward but Leo stepped between the mighty dragon and his own master.  It raised both fists signalling that it wanted to fight and this was met not by laughter but almost hesitation.  Wolfgang pointed to the Antlan and shouted at Pyros to attack. <BR> <BR>The dragon shot forward at speed uncanny for a dragon.  It pushed a sharp wing edge towards the tiny body of Leo and tried to slash him with it, but Leo dodged to the left and launched a powerful fire slash at the dragon&#39;s underside.  Blood mixed with the flames and the dragon let out a screech before turning its long purple head to face Leo.  Its mouth was engulfed with flames before it opened, then with a sudden flick of the jaw, a river of flame was descending upon Leo.  His skin charred and went black but he was not beaten yet.  The flames died off and Pyros waited for the smoke to clear.  When it did Leo was nowhere to be seen. Namis&#39;s first reaction was utter panic.  He had thoughts of his monster being disintegrated by the dragon&#39;s flames but dismissed the idea.  His monster was safe; it had hidden or ran away.  Pyros obviously thought the same thing, as did Wolfgang.  Both were searching around frantically, trying not to move leaving themselves open to attacks, but still trying to search the entire surrounding area.  Namis was the first to see Leo.  About three feet away from the giant dragon was a small shed, which Namis kept his tools in during the winter.  On the roof Leo was hiding behind the chimney.  He was only just visible to him and Namis thought he was probably totally out of sight of the other two.  This meant that Leo could not see them either, and he would have to be Leo&#39;s eyes.  He waited until the dragon turned to the side and was searching the ground. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now Leo!&#34; He shouted at the top of his voice, still on the floor. <BR> <BR>Leo swung around on the black iron chimney and jumped through the air landing on the dragon&#39;s neck.  Pyros had already been expecting the attack but had not yet had enough time to prepare for it.  Leo ran up the neck and hopped onto the creature&#39;s head.  Leo planned to stab its claws downwards into the creature&#39;s skull then fill them with thunder until it fell, or died. He hadn&#39;t expected the dragon to be so fast.  Before his claws were even out the giant purple head gave a flick and launched Leo into the air above him.  Leo tried to manoeuvre but it was hopeless and he fell towards the open maw of Pyros.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t kill him! We need him for the crusade!&#34; shouted Wolfgang who seems to be watching with a mixture of appreciation and dire importance. <BR> <BR>Leo fell into Pyro&#39;s open jaws which sprung shut.  Namis jumped to his feet and ran towards Pyros in a rage but the dragon swept the man aside with a swing of his tail.  Namis fell to the floor to the sound of laughter. <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t be pathetic.  I need this monster, Pyros&#39;s teeth have not entered his body, they are just holding your…. or should I say, my monster in place. Lets go Pyros.&#34; Laughed Wolfgang.   <BR> <BR>He ran over to his dragon and leapt onto the smooth purple back.  The dragon&#39;s wings burst open and began to flap backwards and forwards.  The wind being pushed at Namis kept him from rising to his feet once again and his desperation overcame the pain he had endured when they tail had struck him.  As the two huge feet of the purple dragon left the ground, there was a flash.  Then Pyros let out a terrifying scream and buckled with pain.  Leo took his chance and leapt from the creatures mouth to the ground and stepped back to observe the dragon. It was standing up but shaking and swaying from side to side screaming and blowing tiny balls of fire.  Wolfgang had been thrown off its neck but was already to his feet and looking at his dragon.  Namis could see why the creature was scraming.  In its back was what, Namis thought looked like an arrow.  The point was buried deep in the dragons flesh but it was too far up it&#39;s back for the dragon to be able to reach.  It continued to sway but slowed its screams and that’s when it happened.   <BR> <BR>A nearby bush that was planted next to the tool shed exploded in a rain of foliage and the leaves fell down upon a serpentine shape.  It was a stinger, a vicious naga&#39;s body but green and with a white underside.  It&#39;s long claws were extended to full length and its tail sting was swaying backwards and forwards.  It slithered towards Pyros at surprising speed with its arms ready to attack. <BR> <BR>At the same time an orange flash blurred past Namis from behind him.  Behind the flash a pile of mud was being sprayed in a trail.  The blur slowed down until it turned into a monster.  The monster was a rhino type creature sat on top of a great spongy wheel.  The creature was a deep red and appeared to have segmented red armour. Despite its cuddly looks it was glaring angrily at the dragon.  <BR> <BR>Seconds later there was a deep howl.  From behind the back of the tool shed leapt a pure bred tiger.  Its horns were already charged with lightning as it bounded towards the nervous Pyros.  Although Pyros was very strong he knew that there were now three totally charged up monsters against him. <BR> <BR>Then a deep red shape flew down from a rooftop.  It was a gitan.  The creature looked a little like a rabbit but it could also be desribed as a bat.  Its ears and tail were ended in long, sharp claws and its forearms were outstretched.  The creature flew straight into the cowering dragon and then dodged its two flailing claws so it was facing its back.  It plucked a small trident from deep within the purple dragon flesh and then dived so it was with the other three monsters.  Leo had now stood up and was trying to get enough strength to fight alongside the new helpers.  The gitan smiled at Leo and spoke <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey there, sorry about turning up uninvited but you know we can leave if you want.&#34;  <BR> <BR>This made Leo laugh hysterically and even Pyros stifled a chuckle into a growl.  At this sound the Psyroller drove forward closer and glared at the behemoth.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Silence! Your sick experiments have gone on long enough Wolfgang. Now surrender!&#34; <BR> <BR>What none of the monsters including Leo knew was that Wolfgang and Pyros had a plan for eventualities like this.  Pyros had summoned up all his guts for his get away attack.  Wolfgang stood perfectly still and appeared to be contemplating surrender.  Then he made eye contact with Pyros and it all happened at once.  Pyros&#39;s mouth shot open and his wings opened to full length.  Both the aroller and the naga reacted but not quickly enough.  The dragon burst into flames and began to spin into a cyclone.  There was a large bang and a ring of lazer flew off towards the monsters.  Five monsters hit the floor in pain and Leo opened his eyes just in time to see Wolfgang smiling at him intently.  Wolfgang darted a single hand to his waist and pulled a long, thin sword from a holster hidden by his cloak.  The sword reflected light in all directions and Wolfgang slowly walked over to Leo&#39;s master.  Leo tried to get up but couldn’t, he could not even scream for he had been paralyzed by the dragons attack as had all the other monsters.   <BR> <BR>In a matter of seconds Namis was dead, Wolfgang had mounted his dragon and both had flown into the distance.  Namis was dead.  Leo was stray.
