 Walking home that night was more difficult than he had ever experienced.His mind was a mess since he first stepped in that ring.For some reason, <BR>from the momment he woke up,he sensed that  he had ever known was going to dissapear. <BR>    He then remembered that last,faceless expression on the Mew as it fell backwards to its death.If only it could had been another official tournament.Just any old day;win and rise in the ranks.He only won by death,not victory.That is the only reason is able to fight in rank B now. <BR>     What if he hadn&#39;t have died?Would he have won?Or if he had died. <BR>     He didn&#39;t want to think about that.He would have left so many behind. <BR>     &#34;He probably left many behind&#34;Judo thought to himself. <BR>      He just could imagine many monsters and humans coming together to pay their respects for their friend.Tears,mourning,sadness. <BR>     &#34;You alright,Judo?&#34;Chris asked. <BR>     &#34;Oh,yeah I&#39;m fine.&#34; <BR>    &#34;Hey,I know something that will cheer you up.&#34; <BR>Chris said joyfully. <BR>   &#34;Tell me.&#34;Judo asked. <BR>       &#34;We&#39;re going to the big four,three day cruise. <BR>    &#34;What!?&#34;Judo inquired,amazed. <BR>  &#34;In two days&#34;Chris replied <BR>     &#34;Wow!&#34;Judo said. <BR>        For one time in a while,he was happy. <BR>                      &#42; &#42; &#42; <BR>      &#34;Hey Judo&#34;Said one of Chris&#39; monsters,a Scalie&#40;Golem/Zuum&#41;,named Goliath. <BR>       &#34;Sup.&#34;Said another of his monsters,a Wolfie named WolfEye. <BR>       &#34;Hey bud&#34;Said BoneFist,a Golem,another of his team. <BR>       &#34;You&#39;re finally awake.&#34;The oldest of the group,Noble. <BR>     Noble was a Durahan,filled with honor and glory.Almost killed by a Dragon,he was forced to retire before Judo was born. <BR>    Though Judo did not see him battle,Noble was his all time hero.He was wise,trusting,and never gave up in tight positions.He remembered when he was little,that Noble always told him the bright side of things. <BR>           &#34;Come on let&#39;s start training&#34;WolfEye said. <BR>         &#34;Yeah&#34;Goliath said. <BR>      Judo then slowly stepped outside to begin his last session.
