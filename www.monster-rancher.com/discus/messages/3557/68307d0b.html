 Detan and the others were on the ship.  They had been on the same ship for a long time now, they had not stopped off anywhere for quite some time and were finding it slightly claustrophobic.  Kain was racing against tigers.  They were going into full bound leaping giant steps through the air.   <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Hahaha you will have to do better human.&#34; An obnoxious mono eyed called over shoulder to Kain. <BR> <BR>Kain grinned and pumped his legs faster trying desperately to catch up with the two dogs.  They were much to fast for him though.  They reached the trees a good minute before he did and had already fully recharged when he got there. <BR> <BR>&#34;So you finally got here huh?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Kain said jokingly. <BR> <BR>The two tigers looked at each other then ran into the forest.  Kain watched them fly past in a flurry of fur.  One was a mono eyed that Detan had named Gliad.  He was cocky and far too into himself, he was a good fighter though.  The other was a very quiet but fast hare hound.  The two were very good friends and some how always knew what each other were thinking.   <BR> <BR>Kain walked slowly and tiredly back to the house.  When he went in to the kitchen he saw Fierce, Destiny and Lisa.  Destiny and Fierce were sharing a chunk of meat.  Lisa was drinking water from a large golden glass.  It sparkled in the light as water dribbled down its side and into her mouth.  Kain looked around quickly then asked.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Where&#39;s Bolt?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t seen him for a while now.&#34; <BR> <BR>  Lisa looked around the room as if he would suddenly appear. <BR> <BR>&#34;Sorry.&#34; She said quickly. <BR> <BR>Kain looked at Lisa and raised an eyebrow.  She seemed as if there was something wrong.  He watched her for a while then realized he was doing it and looked up suddenly.  He shrugged and walked back out onto the ranch.  Bolt was standing by a cliff-side; he had his head in his claws.  Below him laid an ocean of binary, a plane of animated sea.   Though the water was kind of real it was just produced in the ship.  Bolt was acting strangely.  Kain slowly walked up behind him.  He looked wrong, as if someone had replaced him with a clone that wasn’t quite right.  Bolt bent hi knees.  It took Kain a second to work out what was about to happen.  Even if the water was not real the drop to it was.  Bolt leapt through the air out slightly.  Kain jumped forward and grabbed Bolt in his hands.  Bolt disappeared.  He vanished.  Kain felt a strange static feeling in his hands, like a tiny electric shock.   The cliff underneath him shuddered slightly.  He stared down at the drop just below him and took a step backwards. A tiny rock fell from the edge and fell to the water.  Before it even hit the surface the ground where it had come from crumbled and fell into the sea.  Kain jumped backwards again but was still out on the crag.  He turn round and saw the whole edge crumbling. He leapt but missed the edge and saw the ground below him fall away.  There was a funny noise like something being pulled from water.  A sticky blue fluid extended around him and pulled him over the edge.  He slammed onto the floor and looked to see a main breed jell.    It put him upright and smiled, then slithered over the hill. <BR> <BR>Kain mumbled a thank you and then fell to the floor panting.   A pair of legs ran up to him, as he looked up he realized they belong to Zack.  He noticed the weirdness again.  Zack did not look right, Kain eyed him cautiously.   <BR> <BR>&#34;There is something marvelous happening Kain.  Auraura&#39;s are coming of the ships hull and reflecting mirages all over the ship.&#34;   <BR> <BR>Kain thought about this but still did not fully trust him.  Zack looked slightly offended. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why don&#39;t you believe me?&#34; <BR> <BR>Kain thought a little more, he had not said anything about not believing him and he was to shocked to change his facial expression.  Zack hung on to the question.   <BR> <BR>&#34;I do believe you.&#34; Kain said convincingly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Good.&#34; Smiled Zack and turned to walk away.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh and Zack.&#34; Kain shouted. <BR> <BR>Zack turned slowly and saw the fist of Kain approach very quickly. It was heading for his face.  Kain swung forward and nearly fell to the ground.  Zack was just out of reach, just, to perfectly just.  He did not have time to move.   <BR> <BR>&#34;What was that?&#34; Zack laughed. <BR> <BR>Kain snarled and jumped straight for Zack&#39;s legs, he felt the strange tingling in his fingertips and then Zack was gone.   Kain thought through the facts he had.  He saw Bolt looking different and then try to jump off a cliff edge.  <BR> <BR>When he tried to save him he had almost been killed but Bolt had simply disappeared.  Then Zack had appeared as if from nowhere and given a fairly good excuse.  When Kain was about to hit Zack, he missed entirely then felt the tingling feeling as Zack disappeared. <BR> <BR>While Kain was still thinking this he saw Detan walk from over the hill.  Detan looked strange just as Bolt and Zack had done.  Kain thought Detan looked angry but soon realized that his face was actually a carpet of fear.  Detan was staring around waiting for something to happen.  He ran quickly up to Kain. <BR> <BR>&#34;Something really weird is happening.&#34; Detan said quietly. <BR> <BR>Kain relaxed an amazing amount; it wasn’t just him who was experiencing this.  When you have someone to share a crisis with it never is as scary.  He turne to face the spots where Bolt and Zack had vanished then turned to Detan. <BR> <BR>&#34;I know what you mean.&#34; <BR> <BR>Detan beckoned Kain to follow him with one finger then went to go back over the hill from where he had came.  Kain followed him silently and suddenly realized something.  Detan had that look to him, just as Kain was getting worried about whatever was happening he had someone to explain stuff and take him anyway.  He looked up and noticed the rock.  A giant boulder perched precariously on the Cliffside above him. He looked from the rock to Detan who seemed slightly irritated.  He made a last minute decision and dug his heel into the back of Detan leg.  The rock wobbled, Detan stumbled onto his knee and the rock fell from above.  Kain had made it to a safe space by the time it hit the floor.  It rolled over and there was no sign of Detan, not even a corpse.  The air around where the rock had landed was warm and slightly static. <BR> <BR>Kain felt terrified.  His best friend, his loyal monster and the pilot of the ship had all been acting in the weird way.  He could not stand the thought of him being cloned and scaring the others.  He ran to the house as fast as he could.  The adrenaline gave him an extra boost and he reached the house in a matter of seconds.  Lisa was in the living room.  He checked. It wasn’t strange Lisa.  He sighed and felt a strange warmth inside him.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Lisa!&#34; <BR> <BR>She jumped from her book and turned quickly, her face a pillar of question. <BR> <BR>&#34;What?&#34;  She said.  There was a long pause while Kain went through his story. <BR> <BR>&#34;Its really strange something weird is going on.  There are..well these people that look roughly like Detan and Zack oh and Bolt were trying to make me think they were them but they could kind of teleport.  It s really hard to explain.&#34;  He spat it out quickly then took a deep breath and slowly, and calmly told the story in more detail. <BR> <BR>Lisa pondered her way through the story then asked some questions. <BR> <BR>&#34;How do they look strange?&#34; <BR>&#34;How did they look when they teleported?&#34; <BR>&#34;How did they get on board?&#34; <BR>&#34;Why are they impersonating us?&#34; <BR> <BR>Kain could not answer any of these properly.  Lisa seemed to hesitate and then desperately tried to say something constructive. <BR> <BR>&#34;What are we gonna do?&#34; Kain eventually shouted. <BR> <BR>This didn&#39;t help Lisa who snapped. <BR> <BR>&#34;I dunno! I dunno!&#34; <BR> <BR>She closed her eyes and clenched her fists desperately trying to get an idea.  Kain felt tired, hungry, thirsty, scared, depressed, angry and desperate.  He was in a mess of emotion and fear.  Lisa was sitting their looking at him.  He looked back.  She was concentrating on him weirdly.  He turned away and then heard her whisperin to herself.  He could not make out the words but it sounded like a complaint.  She suddenly stood up and shouted. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What? Why what?&#34; Kain shouted. <BR> <BR>&#34;What the hell are you talking about!&#34; He screamed when she did not answer.   <BR> <BR>&#34;That’s it, I can&#39;t do it like this.&#34; Lisa snarled.  Her voice was different.  Lower and echoing.  Like a shrill scream coming from within a huge cave. , <BR> <BR>Her eyes glowed red then white, her skin glew from within.  Kain panicked. <BR> <BR>&#34;What the hell is going on!&#34; He shouted. <BR> <BR>Her eyes were now bright white, searing hot.  Her skin was tearing, her body transforming.  Her arms were growing longer, her teeth growing sharper.  She opened her mouth exposing a long sharp tongue, and let out a long, shrill screech. Her fingers were ripping apart as claws extended through.  Her skin was shrinking and dark black scales grew where she had stood.  The transformation seemed complete and she stared angrily at Kain.  Kain was glued to the spot with fear.  She concentrated so hard little droplets of sweat fell from her now huge head.   <BR> <BR>&#34;No, I still can&#39;t why not!&#34; <BR> <BR>She hissed violently at Kain.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Maybe you must be unconscious for it to work. Destiny!&#34; <BR> <BR>Destiny flew from behind a corner and opened his arms ready to attack.  His face was growling.   <BR> <BR>&#34;That’s not Lisa!&#34; Kain managed to stutter. <BR> <BR>Destiny flew into Kain chest and sent him flying against a wall.  His head hit the side and he woke up.  He tried to move.  He couldn&#39;t.  He was chained against a cold stonewall.  As he look to his left he saw Zack and Detan chained just like him.  On his right were Fierce and Bolt.  All the creatures against the wall looked like the real versions but the real version looking Lisa had just turned into a giant lizard creature.  She stood in front of them.  The others were all-awake but seemed not to notice Kain had awoke.  Lisa glanced at him quickly then smiled as she noticed his conscious state.  The others looked at him.  Bolt beeped noisily and sadly.   <BR> <BR>&#34;What are you? What have you done with Lisa?&#34;  He shouted. <BR> <BR>&#34;I am Lisa!&#34; She snarled straight away.  She hesitated a minute then spoke on. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well Lisa is me.  I am Fate, the original fate.  I control most things and know everything a long time before it happens.  Lisa was just a disguise ever since the beginning.  I needed to do things.  When the dragons came it was unexpected, they had somehow got through my site, dodged time.  So I incarnated myself as a human and met you.  I have finally found out something.  The universe is to end.  I do not like to admit it but I have somehow become attached to both of you.  It is wrong.  You Kain are planned to die before the inevitable end.  That is why I set everyone up.&#34;  Her voice was partly a hiss and partly a sob. <BR> <BR>Kain did not even feel slightly sorry for her.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Why? How?&#34;  Kain screamed. <BR> <BR>&#34;I have psychopathic powers outside of the universe.  I hypnotized Detan, Zack and Bolt and made them act my bidding trying to kill you.  Somehow you have a restraint to my psychic powers.  I can hypnotize and teleport anyone I am possessing in my power.  That is why they looked strange to you.&#34;  There was a long pause.  <BR> <BR>&#34;And now I must…&#34;  <BR> <BR>There was an ear shattering crash.  The ship jolted powerfully.  The ship rocked back and forth then the lights went out.  Fate screamed in a hiss and Kain struggled against his bonds desperately.  There was a click and the room filled up with red back up lights.  Fate was looking around then slowly smiled and looked to the tied up prisoners. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now I must kill you Kain, I am sorry but you would have died anyway.&#34; <BR> <BR>Fate stepped awkwardly forward. <BR> <BR>There was a voice.  It was not Kain&#39;s, Zack&#39;s, Detan&#39;s or Fate&#39;s. <BR> <BR>&#34;Stop!&#34; <BR> <BR>It may all be a bit confusing at the moment, but the next chapter is on the way.  It features a big event and leads on to the last chapters of the Kain saga.
