 The next morning brought on a new sense of purpose in me.  Looking back, I know it was low of me to think of Zan as a tool for my revenge, but, that&#39;s what I felt.  That&#39;s what he was made for, right? <BR> <BR>I could tell Sarah was uncomfortable at first with Zan.  She would comment, in the days on the road back towards home, that he smelled of blood.  On the other hand, Zan treated Sarah with the utmost respect, if you could call his minimal actions that.  He would hold things for her, stopped her from falling if she stumbled, all in his odd mechanical way. <BR> <BR>Angel.  While her expression had changed slightly, from sad and depressed to just...  Resigned, maybe?  She wasn&#39;t as unhappy now.  I know it was because I had changed.  We all had.  Sarah and I were filled with some sort of purpose, and less filled with helplessness.  Her and Zan however...  The reactions between the two were almost like, two people who just wouldn&#39;t confess their feelings to each other.  Zan, who never appeared to sleep, would always kneel beside Angel.  More than once, I had seen Zan pull Angel&#39;s blanket over her if it had shifted.  Also odd, was Zan&#39;s complete trust in Angel.  When resting, Zan would make no move if Angel was awake.  While any sudden noise from Sarah or myself would instantly have Zan&#39;s full attention. <BR> <BR>Creepy. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Today, after almost two months, we found the village we had passed on the way here.  Happy at first to see a familiar sight, hoping for more than a tent and what ever we could hunt for food.  We were shocked to find it had been put to the torch.  Almost nothing remained intact.  I was just about to run towards the nearly ruined village, when Zan chirped at me, putting a hand on my left shoulder, and pointing with the other. <BR> <BR>&#34;My goddess...&#34;  Sarah started, her eyes wide with horror.  In the middle of the village, where Durahan had sheared the boulder, were the villagers, strung up on a crudely done gallows.  Most of them looking beaten, burned, or arrow shot.  I felt sickened, the sight of the bodies swaying in the wind, frozen stiff and half mutilated. <BR> <BR>Zan let go of my shoulder, and stepped forward, we followed behind him, Angel holding my right arm tightly.  It looked like the village was indeed burnt, but not by a torch.  This was the work of a dragon, maybe two.  And a half dozen men, maybe.  The few pointers from Geoff, and my knowledge of monsters, as well as Sarah&#39;s, helped us determine what sort of disaster passed through.  Zan was constantly on alert, for what, we didn&#39;t know, but he seemed almost jumpy. <BR> <BR>For the first hour or so, we searched the burnt out homes.  Avoiding the main square that we could all barely stomach seeing.  At least...  The cold stopped them from smelling.  We found more of the same.  Most of the homes were in ruins though we found no bodies.  We did find some food that hadn&#39;t been destroyed.  We felt bad taking it, but, they wouldn&#39;t need it, right? <BR> <BR>Eventually, we started towards the middle of town, the grim task of identifying the bodies, and their burial fell to us. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s when we found the message... <BR> <BR>&#39;Miki!&#39; Sarah called from across the village square.  Her voice told me to go to her.  &#39;Looks like some body left a note for you.&#39;  She said as I approached, pointing to the rock Durahan had shorn the top off of. <BR> <BR>Clawed out on the bottom half of the rock was a short message.  &#39;Miki&#39;s fate.&#39;  Leaning next to it, on the top half of the stone, was a much neater message painted with what looked like blood, I wasn&#39;t about to test that guess, but that&#39;s what it looked like.  &#39;Miki.  I know what was in that temple.  And now the man in blue does too.  You cannot escape us.&#39; <BR> <BR>I felt many things at that moment.  Looking back with the clarity of hindsight, I think what I wanted most, was to hit some thing, very hard, until it was broken.  Then after that, I wanted to cry.  Then break more things. <BR> <BR>I ended up staring blankly at the message with rage locking me in place.  Sarah snapped me out of it, a hand on my shoulder.  &#39;Miki?  Come on, we have to give these people a proper burial.&#39; <BR> <BR>We worked the rest of that day, and all of the next two, digging proper graves for the dead.  Some of the hunters were missing, Geoff among them.  Maybe they were taken prisoner, or escaped.  I could only hope the latter, as the carnage here meant worse for a prisoner. <BR> <BR>Finally, the grim task was done.  But some thing was still bothering Zan.  I asked Angel, and she had only shrugged.  I asked Sarah, but that was just as informative.  Then I asked Zan, wondering if I&#39;d get any sort of answer. <BR> <BR>Surprisingly, I did.  I asked him while he stood near the stone, looking of all things, skittish.  I couldn&#39;t suppress the impulse to hop back a step when he focused his eyes on me.  &#39;What is bothering you Zan?&#39; I asked again. <BR> <BR>He blinked once, his posture becoming thoughtful for an instant.  Then he pointed with one of his blade arms at the bottom half of the stone.  Then, at a scorch mark on a nearly wall.  Next, a bloody claw mark on the same wall.  Last, was a footprint. <BR> <BR>&#39;Dragons?&#39;  I asked, &#39;What about them?  I know there were at least two.&#39; <BR> <BR>Zan shook his head once, then walked away towards the cabin we had set up camp in.  On impulse, I followed him.  Seeing as this was as active as I had seen him out of combat, I thought it the smart thing to do.  Once inside, I found him looking down at Angel, who was standing in front of him, looking up into his eyes. <BR> <BR>&#39;Angel?&#39;  I started, before realizing they were talking some how.  The play of emotions on Angel&#39;s face told me they were having a very fast conversation.  Finally, Zan turned away, and walked back outside.  Angel watched him leave, then looked at me.  &#39;What...&#39; Was as far as I got before she held up a hand, and knelt down to rummage through her back pack. <BR> <BR>The book.  Again it held an answer, but an old one.  Angel brought the book out of the pack, and opened it.  Riffling through the pages, she stopped on the one showing the fusion of two monsters and a hunter.  She pointed to it, then turned the page and scanned the words for a moment.  Pointing again, I read the line aloud.  &#39;Some fusions had worked in reverse, the human form being totally lost to the monster form, yet some of the mind remained.&#39;  Angel nodded as I finished the line.  &#39;So Zan thinks it is another monster like that Dean?&#39; <BR> <BR>Angel nodded, closing the book.  I sat down with a sigh, my sword and shoulder armor clanking slightly.  &#39;Madness...  What have we gotten ourselves into?&#39; <BR> <BR>Angel replied with her all to heart breaking sigh. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR> <BR>Its a bit of a transistion sequence here.  The hero&#39;s starting to make the trek in the general direction home with the treasure, so to speak. <BR> <BR>Wonder how long it will take them to get there...  Will they get there?  Will Zan decide he likes people and eat them?  Will the Man in Blue sneak up and kill them all? <BR> <BR>Fine out, when I get off my arse and write more! <BR> <BR>Thanks for reading.  ^_^ <BR>Sorry for the delay. x_X

 ...Phew! I finally made it to part 18! I am really into this story, that I am! Anywho, the storyline is creative, the character&#39;s personality are unique, and the plot thickens yet again! Can&#39;t wait to see what happens next!:D
