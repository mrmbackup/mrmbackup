 Now here is Chapter 6 of the Story of Wes.  All my chapters from now on have.. <BR>..&#34;DEEP SPACE PLANET ERROR EDITING TECHONOGOLY ACTION&#34;   <BR>Meaning that they will have correct grammer unlike my other hastily essempled chapters that when i have free time, would like to edit and re-post.  They are much more enjoyable when edited.  Anyway here is chapter 6....Enjoy! <BR> <BR>Chapter 6: Mass Annihilation  <BR> <BR>Wes stood there confused of the events that were present. A mysterious and very powerful Joker who seemed to be targeting Killa Kan. Another mysterious figure that was the strange cloaked man that Rancher seems to have a problem with. And another mysterious person was this black-wearing person presently in front of them.   <BR> <BR>“Why are you doing this again!  Just leave me out of this!” Rancher shouted, sounding much like Killa Kan.  <BR>“I am sorry.  I cannot do that.  You must be put out, you know too much,” the black-wearing stranger said calmly. <BR>“Wes.  Get out of here it’s now become too dangerous for you,” Rancher exclaimed, he set a dangerous glare upon Wes, making him at unease.  Wes complied and headed away, but not where Rancher would have advised.  Wes was too curious as to what was going on and located himself behind a near building and peered around the corner.  <BR> <BR>“Well now Rancher, are you ready?” asked the opposing person. <BR>“Anytime you are, Savont,” replied Rancher. <BR> <BR>A cold smile crept across Savont’s face, and he drew his blade.  He drew a longsword from the sheath in his back; it was hidden underneath his long coat.  The hilt of the sword was golden, the handle was wrapped in black leather, and the blade was non-reflective dark silver.  Rancher on the other hand did not prefer swords.  He reached down to his belt.  Two small silver crosses hung there.  The crosses were of hand-held size and were a decent weight.  Rancher pulled them up and flipped both of them, then catching one in each hand, a blade swung from the top of the crosses, making them dagger-like weapons. <BR> <BR>“So you still wield the holy knives of the Dragon, that bear the end of hundreds of lives.  I am surprised that you do; such as the reason you have left us is because of or newly aquatinted “brutal” tactics,” said Savont. <BR>“That is only one reason why I left.  Another reason was when I learned of the Inquisition’s plan.  By the way, what happened to Abbadon after his misfortune?” <BR>“He got a little restoration with the help of Kylate, and with that, they used the Weapon technology and made him more powerful then Draco himself,” Savont said with a sinister manner.  <BR> <BR>“Kylate,” Wes whispered under his breath,” why is that so familiar?” <BR> <BR>“You lie!  You know that’s impossible!” <BR>“I am afraid it is not.” <BR>“You lie!” Rancher yelled as he charged forward crossing his knives across Savont’s body, only to be simply blocked then counterattacked as Savont began a hail of slashes toward Rancher.  <BR> <BR>Savont’s swordsmanship was uncanny.  He moved with lightning speed and swift blows that were just as powerful.  Yet Rancher seemed equally adept with his knives.  He managed to block or evade all of Savont’s attacks and then begin to counterattack.  They both fought with cold hard determination and ferocity.   <BR> <BR>In the stadium the Joker began to charge at the enraged Gobi.  Two loud, grinding gear sounds emitted from the forearms of the Golem.  What was about to happen was something the Joker wasn’t anticipating.   <BR> <BR>The wrists of the Golem rotated inward; the forearms held two large gattling guns inside, which were now visible.  They protruded forward so they stuck out of the forearm.  Then, they opened fire with a loud whining sound.  This all happened in the time of a few seconds, right when the vile Joker was almost upon him.  <BR> <BR>Empty shells dropped to the ground with echoing clangs.  The two gattlings spit large bullets that ripped and tore through the charging Joker.  When the hail of fire ceased, Harvester’s robe was shredded, his mask was cracked and held many smoking holes.  Harvester himself stood still; slightly haunched over with his scythe loosely held in one hand.  <BR> <BR>           “You see,” the dark Joker began, in a now strained and small voice,” I can never die.”  No more then a second after that, a loud hallow groan erupted from inside of Harvester, and all his wounds were instantly gone, almost like they were never there.   <BR> <BR>Without pausing, Harvester swung his scythe upward then charged again.  Killa Kan wouldn’t except this and decided to do what was necessary to take the Joker out.  With a flick of his left forearm, the gattling rotated and was replaced by a large rust colored hollow barrel.  Killa Kan then quickly lifted it to meet the Joker’s level.  Harvester quickly reacted and deviated his coarse, but he wasn’t fast enough to avoid the oncoming blast that the Golem was about too create.  Killa Kan shot a large crackling white beam from the cannon, and it enveloped the Joker.  The Golem continued the constant beam, firing for a couple seconds making sure to overkill Harvester.  Unfortunate for the stadium, the beam hit the wall causing the now empty seats to collapse.  The debris fell on King, who was still knocked out.   <BR> <BR>Killa Kan stopped the flow of the powerful beam, leaving his cannon smoking.  A large black streak was present on the stone floor.  And the charred body of the Joker was lying on the ground.  The mask was blackened and partially melted &#40;which would normally be completely melted if not for the fact that the Joker was not at the least normal&#41;.  And the scythe was black and the blade was broken.   <BR> <BR>The blur of the two combatants outside the stadium still fought.  It amazed Wes that they haven’t tired by now.  Then a loud noise sounded from inside the stadium, it sounded like some sort of whine.  Then after it stopped for a few seconds.  Savont began to speak in a low voice, which Wes couldn’t hear.   <BR> <BR>Savont said quietly, “The Weapon has opened fire on Harvester.”  <BR> <BR>Then Rancher yelled an obscenity and began to fight with Savont.  Rancher now held one blade upside down and the other right side up.  He swung each vertically at Savont, who learned back, then, spun around and slashed at Rancher’s side.  The blow drew blood.  Seeing the success of the hit, and the open opportunity to follow up the attack, Savont did.  He booted Rancher hard in the stomach, which dropped Rancher to the ground, causing him to drop both of his knives.  Now with Rancher on his back Savont decided to execute the traitor and rid Dragon of his heresy.  He spun his blade in his hand once then continuing the motion beginning the swing.   <BR> <BR>A loud blast and rumble sounded from the stadium.  Savont could feel Harvester’s distress and now held his position.  Then quickly seethed his sword and made to the stadium’s entrance.  Rancher uprighted himself and pursued his opponent. <BR> <BR>Savont now saw the visage of the juggernaught standing over the blackened remains of Harvester.   <BR> <BR>“You beast!” yelled Savont.  He ran forward toward the Gobi who was turning to be able to see Savont.  Killa Kan was about to open fire on Savont when the Golem already found that Savont was already upon him.  Savont dealt a surprisingly strong blow that actually knocked the Golem down; it felt as if the person himself was a Golem.   <BR> <BR>Rancher entered to see Savont reciting something in some strange language, which Rancher recognized to be the language of the Dragon High Priests.  Killa Kan was picking himself up when he was knocked down again; he turned to see Harvester was back up.  Rancher didn’t even see the Harvester stand back up or anything, he just appeared.   <BR> <BR>“No wasting time,” Savont began,” just finish them off.”  In reply, the Joker raised his scythe above his head then as he brought it down to the ground; dark flames spouted from the blade and the whole stadium floor erupted in a white blaze. <BR> <BR>Wes saw Savont enter into the stadium, then Rancher.  He waited till he was sure Rancher was a good way in there.  Then he began to head toward the stadium.  He was no more then about three meters from the stadium entrance, when a white hot blast as bright as the sun filled the inside of the stadium.  A second later he heard massive rumbles that sounded like the world was exploding.  The blast sent debris raining over the area. <BR> <BR>Wes wondered if Rancher got caught in the blast, and if he was dead. <BR> <BR>-Nicholas D. Wolfwood-

 A bit etchy in your battles, but not bad. Such a vague use of flashbacks insures much more plot to be uncovered. I applaud.
