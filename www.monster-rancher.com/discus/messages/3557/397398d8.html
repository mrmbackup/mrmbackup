While searching my old floppy disks, I came across a few threads that started a lot of contraversy and imaginations to bloom &#40;These spawned the creations of Rys, Talon, fanfiction on this site as a whole, and even the MR poll of opinions category&#41;. It all started as something to do in the middle of the night, as a couple particular ranchers had gotten bored.  I DID edit pieces of it that were just innane chatter and insults.  Also, I was unable to obtain a copy of &#34;Creative Session 1,&#34; but it was 90% the exact same as Creative Session 2 &#34;Now Then! Time to really create! Let&#39;s GO people!&#34; Overall it&#39;s kept in full tact.  I hope everybody enjoys this playful trip back through time as much as I have. <BR> <BR>Creating Session 3: Let&#39;s go! <BR>greenspun.com : LUSENET : Monster Rancher 2 : One Thread  <BR> <BR>So a Centaur has a Spear, and a Durahan has his sword. What other types of weapons would you give to the other monsters? And what if you could upgrade the weapons and make totally new and powerfull ones? Use weapons that already exist or make up your own, unique weapon, for either an already existing monster or one you made up! And make combos using those weapons! I&#39;m in a creating mood tonight! Why can&#39;t I be this excited over homework?! And create a way for them to defend themselves with their weapon!  <BR>Leo:  <BR>Level 1: Lion Gauntlets  <BR>A pair of gauntlets with a metal claw at the end of each digit. Attack &#43;5, Defence &#43;3  <BR>Level 2: Cheetah Gauntlets  <BR>A pair of light-weight gauntlets built more for speed and ease of use than power. Attack &#43;3, Speed &#43;3, Defence &#43;2  <BR>Level 3: Panther Claws  <BR>A pair of claws made out of a black metal and adorned with an onix on the back. Attack &#43;8, Defence &#43;3, Skill &#43;4  <BR>I&#39;ll come up with more later. Too excited about all these ideas to think! Remember: Be Creative! And the Lion Claw weapons are MINE! Laters!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000  <BR>Answers <BR> <BR>Centaur Weapons:  <BR>Spear - Standard hardware for handling the dry wastelands: No bonus  <BR>Once Rush Slash is obtained, Spear can upgrade to....  <BR>Mace - A spiked club for dealing extra damage: Lif = &#43;10 Pow = &#43;20 Int = &#43;5 Skill = -5 Speed = &#43;5 def = -10  <BR>Once Triple Smash is obtained, Mace can upgrade to....  <BR>Halberd - A truely refined weapon that shows a gleem of intelligence: Lif = &#43;5 Pow = &#43;10 Int = &#43;5 Skill = &#43;10 Speed = -5 Def = -10  <BR>Once Cross Slash is obtained, Halberd can upgrade to....  <BR>Knight&#39;s Lance - This lance was once used by knights in battle.

It is the top of the line when it comes to archery: Lif = &#43;15 Pow = &#43;20 Int = &#43;20 Skill = &#43;20 Speed = &#43;20 Def = &#43;15, Long range = &#43;10 steps  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000. <BR> <BR>By the way, in the last post, that is supposed to be &#34;Archer&#39;s Finest.&#34; I guess taht I&#39;m still a little tired.  <BR>Durahan Weapons:  <BR>Once Flash Slash is obtained, Durahan may use....  <BR>Shield - A plate of old steel that can be used for defense: Def = &#43;5  <BR>Once Slash Combo is obtained, Shield may be upgraded to....  <BR>Carapace - The shell of a large crustacean. It provides slightly better defense than the Shield, but makes the user a little sluggish: Lif = &#43;15 Pow = -20 Int = &#43;10 Skill = -15 Speed = -20 Defense = &#43;15  <BR>Once Air Blast is obtained, and Durahan has used Blood Groove, Carapace may be upgraded to....  <BR>Divine Armor - Mysterious armor that was forged in a secret metal. It provides astronomical defensive skills, without the need of added protection: Lif = &#43;20 Pow = &#43;10 Int = &#43;20 Skill = &#43;15 Speed = &#43;20 Def = &#43;20  <BR>Sword - A dull, rusty blade that is standard hardware for its species: No bonus.  <BR>Once Rolling Slash is obtained, Sword may be upgraded to....  <BR>Alloyed Blade - A finely crafted blade that is sharper than a Tiger&#39;s tooth: Lif = &#43;5 Pow = &#43;10 Int = -15 Skill = &#43;10 Speed = &#43;5 Def = &#43;10  <BR>Once Cut-In-Two and V-Slash is obtained, Alloyed Blade may be upgraded to....  <BR>Blood Groove - An ancient blade with myserious powers.

The very sight of it makes other monsters shudder: Lif = &#43;20 Pow = &#43;20 Int = &#43;15 Skill = &#43;20 Speed = &#43;20 Def = &#43;20  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000. <BR> <BR>By the way, I forgot to mention this, but Durahan&#39;s master weapons increase force by one letter each.  <BR>Tiger Weapons:  <BR>Once Roll Assault is learned, Tiger may obtain....  <BR>Sriped Fury - A shell of spikes that serves to protect a Tiger from rear attacks: Lif = &#43;10 Pow = &#43;10 Int = &#43;5 Skill = &#43;5 Speed = -10 Def = &#43;15  <BR>Once Lightning is learned, Tiger may obtain....  <BR>Forceful Wind - An attachment for a Tiger&#39;s horns. The spiral function of this weapon allows a Tiger to deeply penetrate an opponent, often resulting in KO: Lif = -10 Pow = &#43;15 Int = &#43;10 Skill = &#43;10 Speed = &#43;15 Def = &#43;15  <BR>Once Roar is learned, Tiger may obtain....  <BR>Lock Jaw - A set of metalic incisors that fit over the already sharp teeth. They are used to strengthen a Tiger&#39;s bite: Lif = &#43;10 Pow = &#43;20 Int = &#43;5 Skill = -5 Speed = &#43;10 Def = &#43;20  <BR>Once all Tiger techniques are learned, Tiger may obtain....  <BR>Shockwave - A Tiger&#39;s synapses are stimulated with this device: Lif = &#43;15 Pow = - 15 Int = &#43;20 Skill = &#43;20 Speed = &#43;20 Def = &#43;15  <BR>Once Tiger obtains all weapons....  <BR>Shuriken Claw - An extra set of claws, that a skilled Tiger is able to use as projectiles: Lif = &#43;15 Pow = &#43;20 Int = &#43;20 Skill = &#43;20 Speed = &#43;15 Def = &#43;10, needed range for attacks is eliminated  <BR>To Celious: I know it&#39;s close, but it isn&#39;t the same thing. Besides, where else can one fit a weapon on a Tiger?  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Celious, in response to your move list for your Leo monster...how could you have possibly forgotten Tiger&#39;s Roar? Also, if you want another creative thinking session, how about another one of those posts where we put combinations of monsters that are in MR1 or MR2, but don&#39;t show up without a gameshark?  <BR> <BR>-- Nate Railsback &#40;<A HREF="mailto:ChimeraMan101@aol.com">ChimeraMan101@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Iron Phoenix &#40;Phoenix/Durahan&#41; - This creature is proof that the strongest armor is forged in the flames of a Phoenix.  <BR>&#40;attributes range from 1-5&#41; Lif - 4 Pow - 4 Int - 5 Skill - 3 Speed - 3 Def - 5 <BR> <BR>Hippogriff &#40;Phoenix/Centaur&#41; - Although this monster possesses the wings of a Phoenix, it can only fly on the ground.  <BR>Lif - 3 Pow - 3 Int - 5 Skill - 5 Speed - 4 Def - 2 <BR> <BR>Frozen Phoenix &#40;Phoenix/Tiger&#41; - Unlike most Phoenix species, this monster cannot stand its own flames. Because of this, it is usually found only in the most icy of regions.  <BR>Lif - 2 Pow - 3 Int - 5 Skill - 5 Speed - 4 Def - 4 <BR> <BR>Stone Gaboo &#40;Gaboo/Golem&#41; - This monster does not like confrontation. If discovered, it will camouflage itself by curling into a ball. This makes it resemble a boulder.  <BR>Lif - 3 Pow - 5 Int - 1 Skill - 2 Speed - 5 Def - 4 <BR> <BR>Harpy &#40;Pixie/Phoenix&#41; - These enchantresses have defeated many with their hypnotic gaze.  <BR>Lif - 4 Pow - 3 Int - 5 Skill - 4 Speed - 5 Def - 3 <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll think up some more, later. Any opinions on any of my ideas are encouraged.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>AAAAAHHHH!!!! HOW COULD I FORGET A ROARING MOVE?!?! I WAS SO CAUGHT UP IN PHYSICAL ATTACKS AND PURE POWER THAT I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT A ROAR MOVE!!!! I&#39;M GONNA MAKE ONE RIGHT NOW! THANKS, NATE! And about the Tiger&#39;s armor, I don&#39;t consider the claws a copy at all! I just meant don&#39;t use the name Lion&#39;s Claws or something associated with my weapons. Maybe I was being selfish about the whole claw thing.  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>I think it would be cool if Pixies got Press-on nails that made their pat and slap attacks worth learning. Maybe they could get stiletto heels to do more damage with their kick/highkick/heelraid attacks.  <BR>I also think it would be cool if the Ghost could get different things to pull out of his hat... like cards/dice/coins, etc.  <BR> <BR>-- Bill Mick &#40;<A HREF="mailto:otterzero@hotmail.com">otterzero@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Press on nails and stiletto heels?....  <BR>HA HA HA! That&#39;s cool! Hey, Bill, you&#39;re pretty cool!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Creating Session 4: Alrighty Then! <BR>greenspun.com : LUSENET : Monster Rancher 2 : One Thread  <BR> <BR>O.K., I noticed a REAL lack in double monster moves. Where two monsters combine their abilities/super moves for a huge attack. I posted two earlier. So, let&#39;s see what you people can come up with! Your ideas are great, and very enjoyable to read. Here we go!  <BR>Thunder&#39;s Roar: Gali and Leo- Gali calls on a huge lightning bolt that hits the Leo. All energized, the Leo rushes forward and slashes at the enemy with both claws from the middle of the chest with each claw to the left and right. &#40;I couldn&#39;t explain it very well. I&#39;ll try again, about the slashing motion. He puts his claws in the moddle of the enemy&#39;s chest, like he&#39;s about to rip it open from the middle. That&#39;s when the right claw slashes to the right, and the left claw to the left at the same time.&#41; As the slashing motion finishes, he gives a somersault to pop the enemy into the air. He goes into a slashing frenzy and then proceeds to go higher into the air. As the enemy falls, Leo dives down as a bolt of lightning and goes THROUGH the enemy and jumps to the side when the foe hits the ground.  <BR>Fire&#39;s Fury: Leo and Dragon- Same as Thunder&#39;s Roar, except the dragon blows fire that wraps around the foe. After Leo does his slashing combo in the air, he falls to the ground. When the enemy hits the ground and stands up, he runs circles around the enemy, and all you see is a ring of flames as the enemy convulses in pain, but remains standing. The Leo is actually raking his claws as he passes by the enemy, but as I said, all you see is a ring of fire. He then stops, turns into flames, and rushes past the enemy. The enemy is engulfed in flames. Leo then materializes from the flames on opposite side of foe. Foe falls on ground.  <BR>You see? Like that. Try it out! Laters!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000 <BR> <BR>Answers <BR>In the first line of Fire&#39;s Fury, the Dragon blows fire that wraps around Leo, not the foe.  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 02, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Jell&#43;Seuzo Suffocate to spit &#40;I&#39;m not very good at names&#41; The Seuzo does Chewing and keeps the monster in its mouth but gets smaller and the Jell does suffocate in him then lets go and the Seuzo spits the opponent out. Or it could be a move for the Seuzo. It would be called Backwash. The Seuzo would do Chewing then spit the opponent out.  <BR> <BR>-- Fritz 7 &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Ghostman12@hotmail.com">Ghostman12@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Here are some of my ideas for &#34;team moves&#34;:  <BR>Perfect Kiss: Undine and Pixie. Both of them unleash a kiss at the same time. The enemy monster, unable to choose between them, is unable to regain ANY guts for ten seconds.  <BR>Spin Attack Special: Golem and Zilla. The Zilla rolls up into a ball, like he does for his spin attack, but the Golem picks him up and tosses him! Capable of doing more than 999 damage. &#91;remember, we&#39;re making this all up, so why not?&#93;  <BR>Death X-Slash: Centaur and Joker. Both of them unleash their slash attacks &#40;Z-Slash and Death Slash&#41;. If they KO a monster with this attack, it will die in one month.  <BR>Drunken Boxing Combination: Kato and Hare. Kato and hare take a moment out from the fight to drink some beer. They get drunk, stumble around... then suddenly leap at the enemy, doing ALL of their moves one after the other, trying to prove who is the better martial artist! Of course, this does an insane amount of damage to the enemy.  <BR>Train Wreck Revenge: Worm and Colorpandora. The worm and colorpandora go running around the stage pretending to be trains. Then they speed up &#40;dramatic close up!&#41; and collide, just as they meet... right on top of the enemy monster! They both take almost their entire life in damage, but their opponent takes even more.  <BR>This is fun...  <BR> <BR>-- Bill Mick &#40;<A HREF="mailto:otterzero@hotmail.com">otterzero@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Bill, Bill, Bill. Where have you been for my other posts on creating? I loved yours! They were great! Make more! The same goes for the rest of you! Laters!  <BR> <BR>-- Celious &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lionmage@hotmail.com">lionmage@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, February 04, 2000. <BR> <BR>Incinerating Winds - Phoenix must have learned &#34;Fire Tornado&#34; and Kato must have learned &#34;Tornado Claw.&#34; Kato uses &#34;Tornado Claw&#34; on the opponent, then Phoenix uses &#34;Fire Tornado.&#34; The excessive amounts of oxygen present in the &#34;Tornado Claw&#34; feed the flames of the &#34;Fire Tornado,&#34; creating a prodigous flame that incinerates the opponent into ashes. This also works with Mock and Phoenix, reguaring that Mock has learned &#34;Twister.&#34; <BR> <BR>Red Hot Poker - Pixie must have learned &#34;Flame,&#34; and Golem must have learned &#34;Cyclone.&#34; Pixie uses &#34;Flame&#34; on Golem to turn his body into fiery coals. Golem then uses &#34;Cyclone&#34; on the opponent, and the, now burning, coals char the opponent, leaving a black mass lying on the colleseum floor.  <BR>Hey! Here&#39;s an idea. What if there was a special monster that could only be obtained by getting a certain breed of monster charred &#40;sort of like the method to obtaining a Scribble, in MR1&#41;. So many ideas, so little time.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 08, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Big Boom Flame: An Enormous Zilla K.O.&#39;s 3 Phoenix&#39;s &#40;no offense 2 phoenix lovers, the zilla will be avenged upon&#41; and eats them. He then devoures 3 of Kato&#39;s oil jars, igniting the fire in his stomach lit by the phoenixes. The zilla then curls up in a huge ball as in roll assult and spontaniusly combusts, killing the opposing monster, itself, and the crowd &#40;which includes that fattso guy&#41;  <BR> <BR>-- &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rapman243@aol.com">rapman243@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 20, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Alien zap: Metalner, Tiger or Gali- a Metalner runs twords the enemy at full speed, with galis or tigers surrounding himthe galis, tigers use torpedo or thunderbolt and energize the metalner. The metalner then curls into its space ship thingy and rams the enemt, energizing the enemy with about 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000&#40; you get the point&#41; volts of electricity......  <BR>i must agree, this is fun......  <BR> <BR>-- &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rapman243@aol.com">rapman243@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 20, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Death Wish: Joker, Pixie- The joker does part of a death final, but before it can finish, a pixie appears in front of the opposing monster and says, &#34; Last request?&#34; and uses kiss on the monster,leaving the enemy w/ no realization of the joker behind it, so the joker does repeated death finals, causing a more than imaginable amount of damage to the monster, insantly killing it.  <BR> <BR>-- &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rapman243@aol.com">rapman243@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 20, 2000.  <BR> <BR>That death wish is so sweet.

It will stop at the 1HP, and fly off. When you return, go to the Shrine and get a &#40;Tiger/Tiger&#41;. In June, go on the Kawrea expedition, and bring your Tiger &#40;it must be best natured, and ahave a loyalty of 80 or higher&#41;. At the apex of the cliff, your Tiger will notice an entrance to a secret cavern. Enter the cavern, and continue toward the lava pit. The earth will quake, the ground will shake, and lava will begin to pour. This will be your first encounter with the Iron Phoenix. Being a territorial avian, it will attack you and your monster. Your loyal Tiger will battle it, though, and be KO&#39;ed. Moving in for the kill, the Iron Phoenix gets caught in the backwash of the lava, alongside the Tiger. Your monster will die, and the mission will be considered a failure. Go back to town, get any monster, and raise it for a year. Next June, return to the Kawrea Cavern, and you will find the smokey remains of last years experience. A new Phoenix will swoop down, however, instead of attacking you, it halts. In a weird twist of fate, the lava has fused your Tiger&#39;s DNA with that of the Iron Phoenix&#39;s. The monster will return with you, and is known as the extinct species, Fierce.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR>Indestructable Wall &#40;Monol/Arrow Head/Baku&#41;- Even though its speed is very slow some say it is imppossible to ko it.  <BR>Inferno &#40;Pheonix/Dragon/Zuum&#41;- It&#39;s spit can burn metal.

I had, originally, majored in Computer Programming and CIS systems, but found that I lacked the mathematical and logical know-how for the profession. After that disaster &#40;You know that you&#39;re bad when your ATM program bankrupts the person as soon as they check out.&#41;, I decided that I could STILL be the person designing games, but from the idealist perspective. If you are ever looking for ideas for any games that you may have, or if you need a new idea, I&#39;m your man.  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 04, 2000.
