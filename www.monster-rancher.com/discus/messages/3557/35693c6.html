<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
Imagine this is all scrolling toward the top of the screen like in a Star Wars flick.  <BR> <BR>In the beginning, there was B...  <BR> <BR>And he said &#34;Let there be a message board where Monster Rancher 2 players from all over can come and discuss whatever they like&#34;. And with that, there was a message board, and it was good.  <BR> <BR>Time progressed, and all seemed well on B&#39;s board. Even B himself dwelt on this board for a while, and intelligent debates and discusions were held, knowledge was shared, and everyone prospered.  <BR> <BR>But then, tragedy struck...  <BR> <BR>The first time trouble struck, it reared its ugly head in the form of immitation. There were those who took pleasure in pretending to be other people. They immitated people they admired, people they were jealous of, and even people they did not know. Many were angered by the posts of the dopplegangers, and preached revolt and revenge. Soon, the number of immitators became too great, and all was chaos. People left the board in great numbers, and for a time, the holy board of B was near empty. Those that stayed pleaded to their god for assistance in the form of a registration system, but it seemed that the mighty B had dissapeared in their time of need, and the cries of the board dwellers went unheard.  <BR> <BR>Time passed, and eventually the doppelgangers moved on. Those that immitated grew tired of their games, and left the board dwellers to their own devices. With many of the original &#34;experts&#34; and B seemingly gone, the board dwellers had to fend for themselves, and forge their own path in the post immitator wastes. New &#34;experts&#34; arose from the ashes of the old board to offer guidance to those in need, and a new message board was formed, one that was led my men rather than gods. Though the board would never be the same, things were once again running smoothly.  <BR> <BR>Again trouble struck, and this trouble was worse than the last incarnation. Someone-possibly a hacker-felt the denizens of this board were too harsh to him and his feelings, and decided that the answer was revenge. He want on an orgy of destruction, deleting many of the holy archives, and denying access to all who normally visited this board. This crises was so great that it not only attracted the attention of the missing B, but of another god by the name of Lisa Shock. Wih their combined power, they managed to combat the evil hacker, and to retrieve a small section of the board. Though B did show up, many expressed their dissapointment in his lack of effort, while they praised their new ruler, the almighty Lisa Shock.  <BR> <BR>This brings us to the future. All are cooperating in the reconstruction of the message board, and while the construction efforts are slow going, all have high hopes to restore this board to its former glory.  <BR> <BR>But what new things will this board encounter? What does the future hold? And when and what will the next catastrophy be? Everyone waits with baited breath for the future, be it good or bad.  <BR> <BR>-- El_Buttweasle &#40;<A HREF="mailto:el_buttweasle@yahoo.com">el_buttweasle@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, February 23, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Nice.

Messages from one person, no matter what name and email they enter, will have the same IP address. This system is set up very nicely so that we can look at all messages from one IP address... that means, we click on the message posted by the impersonator, and a list of all the messages from them comes up... including any old ones they may have posted under thier REAL identity. Now, my policy is, if someone repeatedly impersonates people, I delete <B>every message they have ever posted</B>. I encourage Lisa to do the same.  <BR> <BR>Yes it&#39;s harsh. But I really don&#39;t have the time to look through every message from an impersonator or a flamer to see if they&#39;re worth keeping... I just figure they&#39;re all garbage. I&#39;ll let you go this time, but unfortunately, Lisa may not!  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell &#40;apparatus@@juno.com&#41;, February 24, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Well, here&#39;s my first example of &#34;stepping on toes&#34;! I was just deleting while B Campbell was posting. I&#39;m sorry! Well this thread doesn&#39;t make much sense now, since I just deleted some posts trying to encourage people to become imposters.  <BR> <BR>I really don&#39;t believe that &#34;imposters&#34; do any service to the board, either.  <BR> <BR>-- Lisa Shock &#40;<A HREF="mailto:LisaShock@ignmail.com">LisaShock@ignmail.com</A>&#41;, February 24, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>lol, that&#39;s funny.

I&#39;M SORRY!!  <BR> <BR>-- JellTrainer &#40;<A HREF="mailto:lukadjukic@yahoo.com">lukadjukic@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, February 24, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>In the begining, there was Xaras, the one true God of Monster Rancher&#39;ing &#40;if that&#39;s a word&#41; He said, &#34;Why don&#39;t I create a board, and help people?&#34; He did just that, and all were happy. He helped for a while, then became busy and forgot about the people in his village. After that, 4 brave rancher&#39;s came to the top, they were Just Alex, &#40;who resides here, with a different name every post&#41; Dr Jovis, Chode &#40;my hero&#41; and, our very own B Campbell. Now, time went on, and all were happy. Then, the almighty Chode left. Some more time went by, and B seemed to have dissapeared. Now, finally some more time past by, and then Alex, and Jovis left the same day. Now what were the people of Xaras village to do? All the experts had left, and they were left for dead!  <BR> <BR>If you think, this is the end, well it isn&#39;t. 2 brave second generation monster ranchers who had been smaller, contributors steped up and took control, they were Game_Raven &#40;who now resides here under rave&#41; and of course, myself. We handled every problem that arouse, answered every question that came up. While I was writing a post about Chode, I mentioned B. He must have heard this somehow, and came back. He saw that our village was no were near the glory of which he left it in! So, he decided to make a new village, a better village, and this board/village was created. For a while, all were happy, but then Monster Rancher 2 came out in america, and then... &#40;then the other story starts off&#41;  <BR> <BR>Just some more help, from your friendly neighborhood Monster Rancher, Melenium Link Out~  <BR> <BR>-- Link &#40;Gr <A HREF="mailto:Jarkeld@Aol.Com">Jarkeld@Aol.Com</A>&#41;, February 25, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>its cool! i think it should have a cool title, don&#39;t ya think?  <BR> <BR>-- MaJoBeRiDiOmEn!®™ &#40;<A HREF="mailto:organomd@hvisions.com">organomd@hvisions.com</A>&#41;, February 25, 2000.  <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Interesting....when I came here, this board had already been in the works for a couple of weeks. There weren&#39;t too many threads, and trainers such as Wildcard were JUST BEGINNING to discover raising methods. I sat back and observed these advisors &#40;Wildcard, RNA, B Campbell, Zoniks, Miss Carrie, and a few others&#41; until I had gotten enough knowledge to help my self. In a few weeks, I posted my first message. It was some of the first postings on the combination procedure, and raised some eyebrows as to whether it was true or not.  <BR> <BR>A couple of months progressed, and I began to interact more with the other trainers. I answered every post I could get my mouse to, especially the unanswered ones. Soon Zoniks and Varthlokkur left the board. They were replaced by the ambiguous conspicuousness of Tiamat. Tiamat brought comedy and sarcasm to the board, and was shortly followed by Ben Hagstrom, who was once a novice trainer to the site. Ben changed his name to Zuumsaurian, and helped Taimat confuse trainers with comical misinformation &#40;not always though&#41;. His favorite line, was telling people to use &#34;drugs&#34; on their monsters.  <BR> <BR>The board now had a new style, and things were going fine, until Techno Dragon &#40;another good trainer&#41; decided to create his own board. We were all sad, still we wished him all the best. A couple of weeks had passed when we began to receive flase messages. People were mimicing the good trainers in an attempt to leave a blot on their names. No one understood why, but it seemed as if an invasion was taking place. Our trust in one another became a thing of the past, and everyone was accusing someone of impersonation. This is where I achieved my first step to becoming a viable source on this board.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll never understand why, but someone had decided to impersonate ME, and make me look like a cheater. Their plan SEVERELY backfired! Through their use of the English grammar, almost anyone could see that it wasn&#39;t me posting. Still, for some unknown reason, this posting gave me partial credibility to the board. The onslaught continued, and the remnants of the original masters left the board, claiming that Bennet Campbell didn&#39;t care enough about the board to do anything. Things worsened by the day, and at times, trainers thought that the board wouldn&#39;t survive.  <BR> <BR>A character by the name of &#34;Great Googley Moogley&#34; arose from the chaos. He considered himself &#34;THE MR2 Terrorist,&#34; and would consistently reply to messages with jokes and riddles. He told the masters that he was doing this because of something that we had done to him. At the time, none of us knew what he meant. After getting an incesant amount of messages, B Campbell returned and temporarily banned GGM for his acts against the board. He then deleted ALL of the posts and replies that were under his name. B Campbell left again, to attend personal matters, and left the board in running condition. A month or so had passed, and the board was doing fine, or so we had thought.  <BR> <BR>Time passed. One morning, a few of the masters logged on to the site, and received a startling surprise. The site had been blocked- off, and required a passcode. It didn&#39;t make any sense! Campbell was opposed to adding a password system in the time of the imposters. What had happened here!?! The truth was discovered as they noticed the E-mail address. It read &#34;<A HREF="mailto:ha@ha.ha">ha@ha.ha</A>&#34; as the forwarding address. The address couldn&#39;t have been real! All E-mail addresses were followed by the characters &#34;.com, .net, .org, or .edu&#34; Something was VERY wrong there! Many attempted to E-mail the person at <A HREF="mailto:ha@ha.ha">ha@ha.ha</A>. Giving that the name was Bobby Fatman, and not something odd, they assumed that one of the admin had blocked the site. Grahm Fairport created a post in the CD database, and I checked the sister sites of MR2 to get some information. At this point, we had realized that this guy was a hacker, though it made no sense as to why a hacker would bother us.  <BR> <BR>I regrouped as many as I could in Fairport&#39;s post, and asked them to help me find soemone that knew HTML well enough to break through the shell program that the guy was using to cover his main PEARL instructions. Celious motioned everybody into Shield Beast&#39;s Chat Room to discuss the situation. It seemed that nobody knew enough about HTML to come forward and help, but everyone rallied behind me, and with our overwhelming spirit, we were able to chase Bobby Fatman off. We celebrated getting the board back, and B gave Lisa Shock the key to the main site. Having a new caretaker, many thought that the place was safe. Once again, we were wrong!  <BR> <BR>Within a few days, the board had turned into a hacker war! There were innumerable messages about &#34;locking down&#34; the supposed hacker&#39;s computer. This time the board was destroyed! We stood mortified at the holocaust that lay before us. Every post of importance was deleted, leaving a wasteland of worthless information to be the bulk of the site. It was as if we were witness to the fall of Rome. We knew that we MUST rebuild! We began to repost some of the old information and articles in hope of restoring some of the vibrance that the board once offered. It seemed that we had gained a chat room, but lost access to some of the vital records maintained on this site. In a way, though, isn&#39;t that the cycle of life?  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know why, but I felt possessed to write this. Sorry about the rambling in parts : &#41;  <BR> <BR>-- Eagle Fierce &#40;<A HREF="mailto:Eagle1@Citynet.net">Eagle1@Citynet.net</A>&#41;, February 25, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Thank You. I was wondering what had happened. I had stopped posting here when things became too obnoxious &#40;during the imposter phase&#41;, but I would check once in a while. Then I heard about the hacker, and started checking more regularly. Now things seem to be sane again. So, Hello every one. I go by the name of Berge. I&#39;m a computer animator, and I used to program &#40;when I had the time&#41;. I don&#39;t have any new raising theories, or great knowledge about the effects of various things and actions in the game, but I can answer questions about the animation, and why things were done the way they were &#40;most likely&#41;. Otherwise I will be around making occasional comments.  <BR> <BR>-Berge  <BR> <BR>-- Berge &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rellis@bigidea.com">rellis@bigidea.com</A>&#41;, February 25, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Good try Eagle, here&#39;s some info to fill in a bit. When the site was password protected, I contacted the owner of the server. He changed a few things and the gave me controls. I put everything back to normal &#40;removing the password protection, and resetting the links and control settings&#41;and it stayed that way for about a day. B. Campbell, returning to the board from the bedside of his ill mother, emailed me a letter of thanks for helping out and offering me the head admin post. I accepted. I went through the entire CD List &#40;a task which took up 6 hours of my only day off for the week&#41; and weeded out all of the chit-chat, making it a valuable resource once again. Then,the next day, due to a faulty cookie system B.F. was able to go back in and change everything again. I spent two hours in the AM setting and resetting the site; typing as quickly as I could, it would change back as quickly as I reset it. I had to leave, to go to work. Returning after 10 hours &#40;I have a long commute&#41; I found the site not only reset again, but most newer messages deleted, and whole categories of monsters completely gone from the CD List. Then came the forgiveness posts, and things seem to be quiet now.  <BR> <BR>I too wandered over here in the early days, having been a regular at the MR1 board. I mostly lurked while people posted their findings in Monster Farm. I got the game on day one, and was off with the rest on an adventure of discovery.  <BR> <BR>-- Lisa Shock February 25, 2000.

 You know, it&#39;s really funny. When I was at B&#39;s board, I was mostly a lurker. I peeked at posts, occasionally left a message or two, and that was it. Hardly anything, really. <BR> <BR>Then, one day, I came back to the board for an all-too-infrequent check.... and it was gone. Completely gone. Nogthing but a link leadnig up to this place here, pretty much. I was absolutely devistated. I first felt really betrayed, like someone had gone away with B&#39;s board and tried to make their own &#40;which is what I thought at first&#41;. I even delayed coming here for the longest time, because I felt so hurt that the board was hacked, and that no one had done anything about it. <BR> <BR>Boy, I was immature in those days! <BR> <BR>I finally got up enough nerve to come over here, and started to realize exactly what had happened, including people explaining the GGM situation to me &#40;I had never seen anything from him, unfortunately... or fortunately&#41;. I saw what had been done to the board, and was all but crying with relief that we hadn&#39;t lost everything. Oh, we might have lost the postings, but except for a few names, that I&#39;m giong to miss intensely, we hadn&#39;t lost the important part: the POSTERS. <BR> <BR>So here&#39;s to you folk who re-made the board what it is today! Thank you from the bottom of my heart. <BR> <BR>Ugh. Being pregnant makes me all mooshy inside. &#42;snif&#42;

yeah,....I was kinda new at the old board too, when it shut down,...  cause my knowledge of the game,...  was <B>very</B> limited at most. I had heard of the first version of the game from a friend of mine a little after it came out,.. but he lived in Arkansas,... so I never got to see it at all,.. so it kinda faded from memory,...  and then the animated series came on tv,...  and I suddenly remembered about it,..  so I decided to go out and buy it,... and that I did mid january. <BR> <BR>I think I have played it just about every day since then,...  missed a few days here and there,...  but the hours I have played it have wayyyy made up for that,  lol <BR> <BR>and then I tried looking up information on it, to try and help me out...  I tried various game oriented sites,...  and then I think i hit a search engine,.. and <B>BOOM!!!!!</B>  there was the old board,...  so much info, so little time, I said to myself.  And like Kurasu, I psted here and there,..  adding info as best I could,..  mainly just trying to absorb this technology puzzle as best as I could. <BR> <BR>and then that $%^&amp;$ #$$#%# &amp;&#42;^%#,...  or Bobby Fatman, &#40;in more socially acceptable terms,&#41; came along and spoiled it all,...  But Yay!!!!!!!!!!  Lisa came up with this,... the <I>new and improved</I> MR info site,... and I think all of us owe her a great deabt of grattitude for that. <BR> <BR>Lisa,.... I salute you!!!!!!!!
