 Lot and Mahjor were battling it out. while that took place, Zagref was battling Hijora, the Great Betrayer.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Zagref, you are a formidable opponent. But I will win in the end. HAHAHAAAA!!!&#34; Zagref then rushed at Hijora with his soul saber. &#34;You will fall, HIJORA!!!&#34; Then, there was a big...BOOM!!! Everyone looked up. It was Lot. He had brought fire from the Heavens. Mahjor sent thousands of evil souls from Hell. Both were even in power. Mahjor then sent a black mist towards Lot. The monsters in it&#39;s path were immediatly desintigrated. <BR> <BR>Lot used a very shiny shield type of energy to block this. Zagref, looking at Lot, was smashed by Hijora. &#34;AAAAAAAAAHH!&#34; Zagref was sent flying. He could see Hijora lunging at him. Then, out of nowhere, Soluv and Solon came and blocked him. They looked very weak, but they stood strong. &#34;Soluv, Solon, NOOOO!&#34; Hijora slammed by them, and Zagref sent vulcan fire out. Hijora had no problem dodging it. Then, a wounderous thing happened. Time stopped, and Zagref was floating. Everything was still. Even Mahjor. Lot came to Zagref, and touched him. Zagref instantly came to. &#34;Zagref, are you okay?&#34; Zagref looked confused. &#34;Huh, what happened?&#34; Lot chuckled. &#34;I stopped time. To help you, you don&#39;t know it yet, but I will need you in the future.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Now, get up Zagref,&#34; Lot said, &#34;I will heal you.&#34; Lot healed Zagref. Then he clapped very thunderously. Time was back in line. Hijora was flying, and since Zagref was out of the way, he went a far way before realizing something was wrong. &#34;What the...&#34; But Hijora couldn&#39;t finish before Zagref smashed him with his sword. <BR> <BR>When Hijora stood up, he said, &#34;Hm, you are powerful, I will be back.&#34; Then Hijora disappeared in a black mist. Zagref was about to slam him in the face when Hijora disappered. &#34;AAAAAHHH!!! HIJORA, come BACK!!!&#34; Then, Zagref felt he was deaf, because he couldn&#39;t hear anything. He saw Lot had a massive ball of white energy obove him, and he shot it a Mahjor. Mahjor was instantly killed...... <BR> <BR>Zagref couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. Mahjor was defeated..... <BR> <BR>He couldn&#39;t resist it..... He started to cry, happily. He saw Solon and Soluv doing the same. What they had been chasing for decades, was dead...... <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, our mission in life.... is completed.&#34; The three saw Lot fading away..... He was talking in their minds. &#34;Rangers, I have completed my mission. You have helped me in this mission. And for that, I thank you. You will all recieve a gift. Solon, you have recieved a seat in my gallery of heroes. Soluv, you also have a seat in my gallery of heroes. And Zagref, you are the most important. You have recieved the seat to my right hand. But I will need you to do one more thing. You must destroy Hijora, if you don&#39;t, the devil bloodline will continue. You have recieved your mission, now. Good bye.&#34; Every one of Mahjor&#39;s minions were relieved of their curses, but surprisingly, didn&#39;t die. <BR> <BR>Songi came to the rangers. &#34;Rangers, thank you for helping IMa destroy Mahjor. Now FIMBA and AGIMA can return to normal. What the....&#34; The ranger&#39;s clothing turned to gold and silver. Their antlers was turned to the Seal of Lot. It was a &#34;U&#34; with a floating orb in the middle. It was gold. Shoes out of platnum, and arm braces out of gold. They all had scarfs with the Seal of Lot. <BR> <BR>Now the Ranger&#39;s mission was to eliminate Hijora. He was probably the next in line of the devil gene. &#34;I don&#39;t know where Hijora is, but we have to find him.&#34; Zagref said. I think I might know where he is&#34;, Soluv said, &#34;But it is going to be tough......&#34; <BR> <BR>to be continued.....

 Very nice Sturnum. I missed your story. Love the whole godly power Lot used. Mahjor was cool, and you let him die!! Just kidding, I think it added to it. Nice cliffhanger ending. If you&#39;ve got time, I&#39;d like you to read my story. Can&#39;t say  <BR>I blame you for taking a break though, I did the same thing. Can&#39;t wait for 7.
