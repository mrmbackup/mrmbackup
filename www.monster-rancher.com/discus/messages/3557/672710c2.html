<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>GARLANT</B> on <B>Saturday, December 8, 2001 - 11:45 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 Jells are very strange monsters, in someways the most human like.  They have a very human like society.  There are those who are week, and those who are strong.  There are those who are Christian, and there are those who worship Satan.  There are those who are communist and those who are diplomatic.  It were these differences that caused so many wars between the jells. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok troups we got trouble coming!&#34; A voice rang out over the sound of explosions and burst of light. <BR> <BR>Flience lay down holding a jellied arm.  There was a deep purple dripping from it slightly, darker than the hue of Flience&#39;s body.  It had clotted and was slowly healing.  Flience tried to get up.  He failed and fell onto his stomach.  His head was swimming. <BR> <BR>&#34;Stay down buddy, we got a bit of trouble.&#34;  He heard the voice of his best friend Vein say. <BR> <BR>Vein was a pink jam, a pink colored sticky jell type.  Flience could see Vein smiling at him from above but he looked worried.  To his other side was another jells, a normal main breed one.  It dawned on Flience that he was being stretcher carried.  He felt warm and dizzy.  Slowly he trusted his eyes to close and woke up to a soft soothing tone.  He opened his eyes peacefully and looked to his left, a jell was playing the harmonica.  Flience suddenly realized he was able to move without pain.  He looked down to his arm to find a bandage round the deep wound.   <BR> <BR>The door of wherever he was opened and a chloro jell wearing a white cloak entered.  He was carrying a clipboard and seemed very worried.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Flience?&#34;  Hew said with a slightly prepare accent. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, where am I?&#34; <BR> <BR>The doctor ignored this question and stared at Fliences face. <BR> <BR>&#34;How are you feeling?&#34; His voice soothingly asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m fine, but where am I?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Your not experiencing any loss of memory are you? No blindness?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Listen, I&#39;m fine but I need to know where I am.&#34; <BR> <BR>The doctor continued to ignore him and Flience gave up, he propped himself up and tried to slither out of bed onto his base. <BR> <BR>&#34;Please do not move Flience, it could…..&#34; <BR> <BR>The doctor gave up as Flience slowly but easily made his way through the door that the doctor had come from.  Flience happily recognized the interior of the camp.  Vein and several other jells of different types were sitting on the floor and all turned to face him.  They erupted into loud cheers and a drink was forced into hid hand from afar.  He slowly was told what had happened.  The enemy jell army had turrets set up.  They had camouflaged them and so the jell spies had no idea they existed.  With one hit they had destroyed half the jell base.  Flience had been hit worse then any other in that one attack and was knocked out.  The whole army had retreated to the nearest town and the enemies had not seemed to follow.    Flience slept well that night, a hospital bed was surprisingly comfy when you were as tired as he felt.  In the mourning his bandage was removed and he was free to leave the camp as he wished.  He was in the town center when a mustardy came running through the town.  Jells everywhere plus many other monster types ran to the creature. <BR> <BR>&#34;Attack coming, enemys coming from 113 east.&#34;  He spat the words out quickly then leapt over the jells and ran onto the next set of people. <BR> <BR>Flience heard the low bellow of the trumpet.  It meant that enemies were on their way.  Jells everywhere ran for the wall of the town.  They armed themselves with gatling guns, and cannons and waited.  Flience found himself next to Vein.   <BR> <BR>&#34;There coming buddy!&#34; Vein shouted above the background noise of worried jell cries.   <BR> <BR>Vein passed him a pair of binoculars and sure enough a huge cloud of liquid bodies were making there way down the desert.  Flience stared down at his hand as he morphed it between a gatling gun and a cannon.  He finally stuck with a cannon.  The first shot was fired from quite along way down the wall.  Due to their higher position the town jells had a better chance to hit earlier.  A frozen jell fired a cannon shot to start the battle and it hit perfectly.  Black clay blood flew in all directions and with that the entire army began to fire.  Blood flew in all directions.  Slowly the wall of ascending jells came closer and closer to the city gates, firing upwards.  Flience changed one hand to a whip and started slapping the closest jells back.  Others took on this idea and soon the advancing jells numbers dwindled to very little.  Then none.  The jells had survived easily.  Not a single friendly jell had even been properly hit let alone injured. Cheers arose from every jell until there was a deep noise.  A dark growling, but it was strange, high pitched and scream like. Darkness fell over the battlefield.  Hundreds of dragons flew from the horizon forward.  They had strange carriers on their backs.  Full of jells.  They flew over the walls, dropped their riders and then attacked the wall themselves.  Flience and Vein looked to each other.  They ran down the wall steps towards the towns.  Just in front of them a dragon fell dead from the sky.  It ripped apart the stairs but the jells jumped the distance and arose unhurt.  The town was swarming with jells.  But they were week, not the real soldiers.  Without really trying Vein and Flience were able to dispose of them fairly easily.  More were falling but the dragons seemed as if they were loosing.   <BR> <BR>A ragnaroks was about to attack from the horizon, he could just see the falling bodies of his companions.  He was a quick flier and a powerful fighter and due to this it was his job to carry the general.  General Steelix was wearing a head gear, a jell helmet, covered in feathers and gems. The dragon stopped as he realized they could not win, he tried to turn.   <BR> <BR>&#34;What are you doing creature?  Fly onwards or I will gatling you myself.&#34; The general shouted over the noise of battle.   <BR> <BR>His hand slowly changed shape and he aimed it downwards at the dragon.  The ragnaroks thought fast and vied into a tailspin.  The general tried to aim his arm at the black serpent but the power of the wind was too much.  The dragon pulled up suddenly and all three of the jells he was carrying were crushed against the floor. The dragon turned from battle and ran, he flew to the mountains.  He was no longer a hero but a traitor, he could never show his face again.  He was an outsider. <BR> <BR>Back in the city Flience was desperately disposing of the last jell soldiers.  The floor was thick with jell blood of many colors.  The oily blood did not mix properly.  Flience turned tiredly, his arm wound had long ago opened up again and he was drowsy.  He could not focus.  His brain began to play tricks on him.  A jell rose up infront of him. <BR> <BR>&#34;Die jell!&#34; He screamed and let loose a barrage of gatling bullets.  The jell keeled over, bleeding in multiple wounds.   <BR> <BR>Vein sunk to the floor clutching his stomach and dispersed into a puddle.  Flience felt a stab in his back and woke up in hospital again.  He tried to move but could not.  The same doctor returned.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Traitor, I should not have saved you!&#34; The chloro jell spat out. <BR> <BR>Flience realized what had happened.  He had to escape and right his wrongs.  He spent an hour trying to explain to the doctor but he just wouldn&#39;t listen.  He had to kill the doctor aswell, he really hated him but he had to do it.  Flience was now an outsider too.
