 Hey my few readers. This might be the last one for a bit, because Basketball is starting and i have practice Mon-Fri. You never know, though. <BR> <BR> <BR>The road to Hyander was a long and hard one. It was fifty miles from the town I was at. We started off early in the morning. I bought supplies for the journey, tried to figure out a way to pay the innkeeper only to find that it was paid for, and turned to the road heading west towards Hyander. The trip was a lot easier for Devlin and Stefioni than me, for they float. So, we hitched a ride with a passing merchant. He suddenly stopped at the edge of a forest. <BR> <BR>“That’s a far as I’ll take ya,” he said in a very quite and timid tone. <BR> <BR>“Why?” I didn’t understand the merchant’s fear. After all, it was only a forest. What could be in there except for small animals and the occasional wild monster? <BR> <BR>“Don’t know exactly, ‘cause no one’s ever made it out alive. Some say that there are monsters living in the forest that can do moves together. They are said to be controlled by an evil sorcerer. He kills people and their monsters just for the heck of it.”  <BR> <BR>“Yeah right. If you refuse to go any further, then I guess my stop is here. Thank you for the lift.” <BR> <BR>“No, son, don’t go in there!  I can take you the long waysround. Just don’t go into the forest, whatever you do!” <BR> <BR>“I don’t believe that superstitious crap. I need to get to Hyander as soon as possible, and that forest is the only way. Goodbye now.” I walked off into the forest, hearing “it’s suicide, it’s madness, stupid lad!” fade off into nothing. That sort of irked me. <BR> <BR>As I walked, or rather stumbled, through the forest, I noticed how close and dense it was. The air had a humidity that was just below unbearable. All types of trees, and shrubs, and many other plants were growing there. Everything was tightly packed. It was hard to get through the foliage. Devlin and Stefioni breezed through it though, thanks to their hovering. I envied that, especially now. Various animals were admitting their voice, birds being the most prominent.  <BR> <BR>A rabbit flew by, terrified, being followed a fox running just as fast. Dinner was my first thought, but something, something big changed my mind. Pushing trees down as it came lumbering towards me was the biggest Baku I had ever seen in my life! It stopped right in front of me, and just stood there, panting. Then, a Suzurin, one of the smallest I have ever seen, came ringing from behind it and under its belly. I had no idea what to do. I didn’t know whether or not to attack or to walk by. I tried to walk by, for attacking wouldn’t have been the most honorable thing to do, but whichever way I went, they blocked my path. Well, it was really the Baku that blocked my path. The little Suzurin just followed him.  <BR> <BR>I heard something rustling through the trees, something very fast. This made the Baku and the Suzurin joyful. Now I was really worried; for myself, and my monsters. Out of nowhere, a man materialized. He had shaggy clothes and was unkempt, which suggested that he had been living this forest for a very long time, maybe most of his life. He was as about as tall as I was. The way he wore his clothes and his hair gave him the look of a crazed wizard. He was seemed crazy, indeed, but certainly no wizard. From what the merchant said of his monsters being able to work together, I guessed that he might be one of the Soul Masters. I don’t think he knew that, though. A lost Soul Master excited me. I tried to confront him, but that was definitely a bad idea. <BR> <BR>“Get away, maggot! Your kind is not welcome here. I see you have met Belle and Tony.” He pointed at the Suzurin, then at the Baku. “Belle, make the maggots dizzy, and Tony, flatten them! Flatten them real good!” He said this with such a maliciousness and hatred in his voice that I knew instantly I had to be on my toes. Belle’s attack hit Stefioni, but Devlin dodged it. In dodging, he it a tree and fell unconscious. This did not look good. <BR> <BR>The Suzurin picked up Stefioni -who was so out of it she could barely float- and lifted her with, surprisingly, ease and threw her against the same tree which Devlin had so clumsily bashed into and became unconscious herself. The Baku then took a running start, jumped, and slammed down upon them. I had no clue what to do. It was the hardest thing in the world to do, to watch my monsters get repetitively pulverized by this enormous Baku. All I could do was to beg.  <BR> <BR>“Please, whoever you are, stop! We mean you no harm. Spare my monsters. We are only traveling to Hyander.” My pleads did not budge the cruel face of this torturer who just laughed maniacally. <BR> <BR>“What, and stop all of this fun? Never! The world and everyone in it is the enemy. You are going to somewhere in the world to someone in the world, so must you be the enemy as well. It’s logic, really. Ok, Tony, that’s enough. Belle, get into Tony’s mouth. Get ready, maggot! BWAHAAAA!” This was it. My monsters, my journey, my mission to free Thomas and the others, it was all to end here.  <BR> <BR>The Suzurin shot out of Tony’s mouth like a bullet from a gun.. “NOOOOOOOO!” I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then, something that I didn’t expect happened. Some sort of shield stopped belle. That same shield then electrified her. She instantly fell to the ground, singed. I was shocked. No pun intended. A giant electrified water bubble surrounded Devlin and Stefioni. Yes, you heard me right. It was a giant electrified water bubble. <BR> <BR>“What? A Soul Attack!? That can’t be!” and with that, he sped off into the far reaches of the forest. With the Baku lumbering behind him and the knocked out Suzurin on its back. <BR> <BR>I ran over to the duo, which were wide-awake. It seemed that my screams of distress awakened them. The rest of the journey through the forest, which I later named The Crazy Forest, &#40;not very good with names, am I?&#41; was a quite easy one. We had to take a rest many times on account of the many and various wounds that Devlin and Stefioni had received with that guy. It was then I realized that I never even found out his name. I came out of the forest with many things running through my mind. What to call my new Soul Attack was on the top of the list.

 I really like how you&#39;ve come up with a whole new way to look at monsters! Soul attacks are a very original thing! Are you thinking of making every monster have a partner? That would be really cool!

 Thanks. The Soul Attack thing isn&#39;t very original. I got them from the whole &#34;two monsters <BR>powering up the third monster&#34; thing in MR4. Yeah, in the story, every monster has a partner. Well, the regular ones anyway. &#40;not the one hit wonders, although, most of them ROCKED&#41; I am glad to see that someone is reading my story. I don&#39;t know how much I will be able to write in the next month or so because I&#39;ll have Basketball practice Mon-Fri, and will use the weekends to layze around. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll see what I can do.

 Really? Well, still, I like the idea:P And I do that all the time when I&#39;m writing, then when I proofread I find myself nearly rewriting the entire thing because it&#39;s mostly repeats!
