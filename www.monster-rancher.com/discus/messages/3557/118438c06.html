 There were two places set at the dinner table that night instead of the normal one. A Mocchi came into the antechamber and motioned that dinner was ready. The host and his guest came into the dining room and sat down to eat. <BR> <BR>“Oh! This turkey is fabulous! What’s the name of your chef?” asked the guest. <BR> <BR>“If you can believe it, it’s a Garu. They are surprisingly good chefs,” replied the host. By the way things were going, you would never know that one was a prisoner and one was his capturer, that is, until one had to make a choice. <BR> <BR>Suddenly, a mail Kato came running into the room and handed a letter to the host. “Eh, what’s this?” The Kato made a motion of urgency and spend out of the room just as fast as he came.   <BR> <BR>“What’s it say?” <BR> <BR>“Let me see…hm… it’s a note from my employer.” <BR> <BR>“You mean the one you don’t even know?” the prisoner said with obvious hatred in his voice. <BR> <BR>“Hey, money is money, Gavin. Anywho, it says: <BR> <BR>Jacques, <BR> <BR>You incompetent fool! Hannah has escaped, while you are sitting as cozy was a Mocchi in a soft pile of hay in your castle! You are fired, and to make sure that you don’t let loose about my plans, you have about ten minutes to run. I am sending a battalion of Phoenixes to melt you with your precious crystal castle. BWAHAHAA! <BR> <BR>Yours truly, <BR>Duwanee” <BR> <BR>“Woah, he’s odd,” said Gavin full of sarcasm in his voice. <BR> <BR>“CRAP!!! I’ve got to get out of here! Although, his thugs’ll just hunt me down, what’s the use?” Jacques fell down in despair. <BR> <BR>“I know,” A plan was forming in Gavin’s head. “Why don’t you come with me? You no longer have this guy governing your morals with his money. Help me get what he wants and one up him!” Gavin knew how much his old friend loved revenge. <BR> <BR>“Yeah…that might work…” a smile was now forming on his face. “Let’s do it! Do you know where it is?” <BR> <BR>“Uh...sorta…but I know one who does, and so do you.” <BR> <BR>“Hannah! Why didn’t I think of it before?” <BR> <BR>“So, are you go?” <BR> <BR>“I’m more that go.” He then stuck out his hand palm down. Gavin did the same thing. Their hands met, baking a spinning motion and then a snap: their hand shake from the academy days. <BR> <BR>“I haven’t done that in a long time. ‘tfelt good. We’d best be off, those Phoenixes will be here any minute.” <BR> <BR>“Yeah, I’ll tell everyone to evacuate and you go get your monsters” <BR> <BR>Lucky for them, Jacques had put an underground tunnel in the castle. <BR> <BR>“I always knew that this would some in handy someday, me being in the mercenaty business and all,” said he. So, tell me a bit more about this Third Soul everyone is raving and ranting one about…”     <BR> <BR>Hey all, sorry ti&#39;s taken so long for the next part. Basketball season got hecktic. Anywho, enjoy!

 Well, a few typos noted throughout, but nothing too serious. It was a little short for my tastes, but that is fine, too. <BR> <BR>Nice chapter though, overall.
