 -Just a revamped version of the original, making it easier to read with a few grammatical changes.- <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I think it may not be able to handle the power,&#34; Jace stared at his fellow scientist, &#34;He may not be able to fully control it.&#34; <BR> <BR>Rodney, another scientist, looked over his shoulder at the new arrival. Jace noticed his glare as he said, &#34;You worry too much. You&#39;ve only been here a month and your irritating me.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I-I&#39;m sorry,&#34; Jace stammered, &#34;But, you really think this can be achieved? Reviving this ancient-&#34; <BR> <BR>Stone walked passed the inquisitive new addition to the team, &#34;Don&#39;t worry so much. You call yourself a scientist. If you are, then anything should seem to be logical.&#34; <BR> <BR>Jace walked up to the huge tube in the middle of the large room where they worked. He looked at the being inside of it. <BR> <BR>&#34;A new breed?&#34; Jace tapped the glass. &#34;Not just a breed, an entirely new genus.&#34; <BR> <BR>Stone appeared by his side. Rodney walked over to his terminal and stared into the computer screen. <BR> <BR>&#34;Stone...&#34; Rodney&#39;s voice rang through the chamber with an eerie tone, &#34;You...need to see this.&#34; <BR> <BR>Stone walked to the other scientist as Jace&#39;s view fell back on the tube. Only a faint shadow could be seen in the tube. As he turned, he saw his two new companions staring into a computer screen. Only the monitor&#39;s glow lit that dark corner of the room. Only Stone and Rodney were allowed over there. Other scientists filled the room yes, but only they were allowed at that station. Jace was always the one to snoop. <BR> <BR>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; He asked as he walked towards the two. <BR> <BR>A load thump came from behind him. He spun to see a giant electrode lowering into the tube, not touching the specimen, but dangerously close. <BR> <BR>&#34;What is that?&#34; Jace stepped back from the tube, &#34;What are you doing?&#34; <BR> <BR>Jace spun to see Stone stand and approach him. As he did, he said coldly, &#34;Our job.&#34; <BR> <BR>The rod shot off and electric bolt into the mass in the tube. The creature began to shake violently, smacking the tube as it began to swim in a circle. The cylinder barely had room for it, much less it swimming circles. <BR> <BR>&#34;What is it doing?!&#34; Rodney&#39;s voice rang out, &#34;Stone?&#34; <BR> <BR>Rodney looked to Stone, who merely sighed and said, &#34;We will not survive this.&#34; <BR> <BR>Jace shot and quick glance at Stone, then back at the glass as a heart wrenching sound came from the tube, a cracking. <BR> <BR>&#34;Good god, what did you two do?&#34; Jace spun and ran to the terminal as scientist ran in every direction. Panic swept the room. Jace grabbed Rodney by his collar and lifted him in the air, &#34;What is it doing? What does it want?&#34; <BR> <BR>Rodney managed to choke out one thing, &#34;...freedom.&#34; <BR> <BR>Rodney found himself flying through the air in the next instant. Rodney slammed into the wall as Stone ran towards Jace. Jace spun in time to catch the flying fist in the side of the mouth. Jace spun and collapsed on the counter of the computer. He looked down at the console he leaned towards, and saw blood, his blood, being lit up by a light. A pulsing, red glow. He gazed up at the monitor to see the word &#39;Error&#39; parading across the screen. Then, he felt a hand land on his back, grasping a handful of his white jacket&#39;s collar as he was lifted into the air. Stone was superior to all of them in the size department. Jace dangled there, waiting to be thrown. Then he was dropped to the floor in the wake of a horrible sound. <BR> <BR>Screaming mixed with the sound of rushing water and breaking glass. A scientist flew over his head, then another. One hit the wall with a crack, then fell to the floor, then laid still. The other smashed into a terminal beside the untouchable computer. His head slammed into the computer monitor, the glass gashing his skull. Jace stared at him, not sure if he was alive or not. The person answered as the limp body rolled off the counter. <BR> <BR>Stone&#39;s grip loosened and Jace fell to the floor. He turned to see Stone being lifted into the air by a massive beast that he couldn&#39;t make out. Stone dangled helplessly in the air in what seemed like a human hand. <BR> <BR>Several shots were then fired. Jace looked to see Rodney with two laser pistols firing nonstop on the beast. He cared not for aim obviously. One shot hit Stone in the arm. A few more hit the creature, but another strayed from its target. Jace watched in horror as a blast went strait through Stone&#39;s skull, splattering its contents on the far wall. <BR> <BR>The creature, still under a hail of fire from multiple directions now, lifted Stone&#39;s body in the air, examined it, and tossed it to the side. The gun-fire didn&#39;t even bother it. At this point, Jace made out what it was. <BR> <BR>It was an odd shape, along the lines of a Golem, but not a Golem. It had a long neck and two large wings. Still, it was not a dragon. It had several markings on it, tattoo symbols of some sort. It was an orange color and yet, was oddly large for a child. Then, it bellowed, &#34;I am Roketh, Lord of the Elements. Who has awakened me?&#34; <BR> <BR>Jace walked over towards Rodney, who had stopped firing at the shock that it could speak. Roketh sharply turned his head at the sight of movement. The others had stopped firing as well. <BR> <BR>&#34;Where did you get him? He is obviously not a child?&#34; <BR> <BR>Rodney sat down in a nearby chair and began, &#34;We found him on Mt. Rovest, named after the great explorer. He said that several trainers had created rare monsters and that his would reside there. When he died, we went up there. We found him, fossilized. Our new technology far surpasses the cryo-chamber we found him in. Their technology was primitive indeed.&#34; <BR> <BR>Jace leaned over Rodney, &#34;And you woke it up?&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Roketh stared down at the two. His gaze switching from one to the other. He settled his gaze on Jace and asked, &#34;What of the others?&#34; <BR> <BR>Jace was stunned at the fact there may yet be more. Jace calmed himself, and walked towards the computer that had been guarded up until this point. <BR> <BR>&#34;No! Jace! Don&#39;t!&#34; Rodney dove at him. Jace turned to be tackled by Rodney. Jace quickly kicked him off. Both regained their balance and Rodney said, &#34;I can&#39;t let you....I WON&#39;T let you. You&#39;ll start something that will be the end us all.&#34; <BR> <BR>Jace stared coldly at the charging scientist. He dodged his wild swing and tripped the good doctor in the process. Rodney hit the floor with a thud. Jace turned and started towards the terminal again. <BR> <BR>&#34;NO!&#34; Rodey stood with a pistol and a newly found clip. He loaded it and pointed it towards the back of the departing man in a white cloak. <BR> <BR>Then, a massive hand wrapped around the scientist as he screamed. Even in the grip of the beast, he unloaded an un-godly amount of ammo at Jace. Jace ducked behind a the counter. With his former target out of the way and his death approaching quickly, Rodney began to take wild shots at the computer that housed the knowledge he wished to remain a secret. Luckily, he was not a good soldier, and failed in his attempt to blast the terminal. <BR> <BR>Jace stayed behind the counter in fear that the mad man had only paused for an instant. Then there was the gut wrenching, crunching sound and the screams from Rodney that greeted Jace as he stood. He dare not look in the direction of the beast, whom he new had just eaten his partner. He slowly walked to the computer and sat down. He noticed the blood he had left on the counter and it reminded him that his lip was still bleeding. Upon realizing this, it began to sting. <BR> <BR> <BR>He decided to ignore this for the moment and began accessing the files. He managed to get in. <BR> <BR>&#34;What did you find, brave one?&#34; Roketh&#39;s voice seemed to shake the chamber. <BR> <BR>Jace began reading the file out load. &#34;Roketh, you are the pivot point of the Eight Lords. Each lord was not a creature like you, they were different. You were meant to find them. Then, upon receiving their power, you can defeat the ultimate evil.&#34; <BR> <BR>Jace squinted his eyes at the screen, then proceeded,  &#34;The evil is unstated. The lords consist of Water, Earth, Air, Fire, Good, Evil, and Combat. You are the lord of the elements. You can receive the powers of the other seven lords to increase your own. Then, you may control all of the elements they do. You can use earth with the Earth lord&#39;s power, water with the Water powers, and so on. Once you control all of these powers, you will evolve. Then, you may fight the ultimate evil.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh stood silently for a bit. Then he looked down at Jace and said, &#34;What is the evil? Where are the others?&#34; Jace tapped at his computer a bit more before saying, &#34;I do not know. It says nothing about either.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh stared at the human, &#34;You will come with me. We will find my brethren and summon them when the evil arrives.&#34; Jace merely nodded, petrified with the fact he would be risking his life soon, if he wasn&#39;t already. However, he dare not go against this beast. <BR> <BR> <BR>Stay tuned for chapter two. Enjoy! CHB

 I&#39;m going to redo some of the early chapters, rereading, there are some changes I&#39;d like to make. <BR> <BR>Nothing to plot line, just grammer and format mainly. <BR> <BR>It is my baby, after all.  O.o

 I&#39;ve only read chapters 1 and 2 so far.  It&#39;s pretty interesting, but there are a lot of mispellings.  What makes you think that &#39;fingers&#39; is spelled &#34;fingures&#34;?  Anyway, so far so good.  I really hope that there&#39;s some kind Henger that kicks butt &#40;stupid censor&#41; in this story.

 I re-wrote this two years ago, but when I first wrote it I was in the 14-15 range. <BR> <BR>Read more of the chapters, and you&#39;ll see my skill progress.
