 The two friends walked on a road that was lined by a meadow on both sides. They were on a path commonly used by merchants and travelers between the cities of Joriol and Yoren. Now and then people crossed their path and gave friendly greetings, which they returned. Lorin looked up at the sun. It was too damn hot for travelling. He stopped and looked at Rys&#39;s back.  <BR>   &#34;Rys, do you have ANY idea where we are going? Or are you letting the road and instinct take you along?&#34;  <BR>   Rys stopped and turned toward Lorin.  <BR>   &#34;I have heard that an oracle of sorts lives to the north and I wanted to ask him or her how we may go about defeating Moo. That&#39;s my destination.&#34;  <BR>   Lorin walked off the path and sat in the shade of a tree.  <BR>   &#34;That&#39;s all good, Rys, but may we take a break? It&#39;s hot and I don&#39;t feel like walking right now.&#34;  <BR>   Rys looked up at the sun and shielded his eyes. A drop of sweat carved its way through the dirt on his face.  <BR>   &#34;Okay. It IS a bit hot, isn&#39;t it?&#34;  <BR>   He sat next to Lorin, took off the animal-skin canteen he had strapped around his chest, un-stopped it, and drank from the water in it. He passed the container to Lorin, who took a long pull of the liquid within and then passed it back to Rys, who put the cork back in and placed it back on.  <BR>   &#34;So, Rys,&#34; Lorin began, &#34;Were you present at the city when it was attacked?&#34;  <BR>   A sad expression passed across Rys&#39;s face.  <BR>   &#34;No. I had been returning from a trip to Anoran, a neihboring town, when I saw smoke rising in the distance, from the general direction of my city, Akairion.&#34; He began. &#34;I ran to the front gate of the city and withheld a horrible scene. Buildings smoldering from fire, and some still burned. The acidic smell of burning wood filled my nostrils as I walked through the town in a total daze. It seemed as if a graveyard of sorts had sprung up overnight. I saw thousands of Leo Lost Disks. But I also saw many Joker disks as well, tipping me off to who had attacked the city. I walked toward Aka Square, the heart of the city. I percieved ten or so Jokers, wearing Moo&#39;s crest, drinking alcoholic beverages from our own stores. They seemed to be celebrating their victory. I overheard their ramblings. They were saying how they had surprised the city and overtook it with only a hundred Jokers. I was filled with such a rage that I took out my sword,&#34; he patted the samurai sword on his waist, &#34;and killed nine easily enough; since they were so drunk from their drinking they were clumsy and weak. But one of them, obviously their leader, did not have the stench of alcohol on his robe like the others did. He obviously had none of the drinks that the others had. We fought for a good while, about two or so hours. He finally fell when he turned invisibe and I was able to spot him with my Holy Sight. He wasn&#39;t facing me and had no idea that I could see him. I fired an Energy Blade at him and it went through his body, killing him. I then swore revenge against Moo and left the smoldering city, ready to repay him for the lost souls of my family and friends.&#34;  <BR>   &#34;What a touching and interesting story.&#34;  <BR>   Rys looked at Lorin, a confused expression on his face.  <BR>   &#34;You said that, right?&#34;  <BR>   Lorin shook his head.  <BR>   Suddenly, a black smoke filled the countryside. Lorin and Rys shielded their eyes and coughed as the smoke burned their lungs. As the smoke cleared, a person dressed in a black ninja costume stood before them. But they could see that he was not a person, for a black tail swayed back and forth behind him. Upon closer inspection of the tail, you could see black spots on it. He wore the crest of Moo on his chest. The ninja spoke up.  <BR>   &#34;Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Shakahn and as you probably know...&#34;  <BR>   He patted the symbol on his chest.  <BR>   &#34;I serve Moo. I hope you don&#39;t think that he doesn&#39;t know of what you two had done. He doesn&#39;t appreciate it when people destroy his followers and armies.&#34;  <BR>   Rys was filled with a rage that seemed to spring from his soul. He looked at the ninja.  <BR>   &#34;And I don&#39;t appreciate it when armies destroy my people!&#34;  <BR>   He jumped up and rushed toward the ninja, samurai sword out and glistening in the light of the sun. Shakahn held out his hand.  <BR>   &#34;Shadow Stop!&#34;  <BR>   Rys suddenly stopped in place, a black glow surrounding him. Lorin stood up, took out both his swords, and started ran toward Shakahn. The ninja pulled out two shuriken, seemingly out of nowhere, and flung them at the Cheetal warrior. They hit each hand and made Lorin drop his swords.  <BR>   &#34;I will be taking your friend the Leo.&#34; Shakahn stated. &#34;If you want to see him again, come to the Shadowkeeper&#39;s Temple in the west. I&#39;ll be waiting.&#34;  <BR>   He threw down several black balls and they exploded with a jet-colored smoke. Lorin hacked and coughed as the acidic smoke stung his eyes and burned his lungs. When the smoke cleared, Rys and Shakahn were gone.
