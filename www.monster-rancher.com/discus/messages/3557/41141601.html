 Epilogue: <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m telling you we should go back! Make sure the jobs done!&#34;Ciera screamed at her leader in a tone she shouldn&#39;t have. Raa-zor merely gave her an evil look and then turned back to the other zyoth. They had been given new orders, and none of them involved his dimension, they were leaving finally... &#34;If it really has gotten more powerful the stasis crystal might not hold it!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That thing is buried under a million tons of metal, it&#39;s going nowhere.&#34;Raa-zor replied... &#34;Besides, you heard the orders. The creature is no longer our concern. We&#39;re needed back home.&#34; <BR> <BR>Ciera made a disgusted sound and crossed her arms...&#34;I say we just use the weapon and blow this realm to pieces.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We can&#39;t do that...&#34;Another zyoth interupted...&#34;New reports suggest that it would damage more then one realm, maybe even our own and the master will not chance it.&#34; <BR> <BR>The female zyoth gave up and stalked off somewhere, muttering under her breath... Meanwhile Raa looked over to the far horizon... <BR> <BR>&#34;If that thing does get loose...Time help them...&#34;With a swirl of his cloak the zyoth turned away, joining his brethren as they departed his realm... <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>It was noon, the azure sky was clear and free from a single cloud. The sun rained the golden rays of it&#39;s warmth upon the land...a land engaged in rebuilding. The war against the Master had been devastating for all involved. The IMA had suffered great losses, and it would be some time before they could get things undercontrol. Until then all tournaments had ceased and the administration office was in turmoil. The monsters loyal to Moo had withdrawn as well, having all their bases crushed, shattered by the ravens cry. An age of rebuilding had begun...and Cid&#39;s old ranch was no exception. <BR> <BR>Stoneclaw, Ganthor, and Celine stood before &#39;something&#39;, gazing at it with a measure of both respect and pride. The ranch around them was milling with hundreds of monsters building new barns and places to sleep. They were the survivors of Justice&#39;s army...monsters who&#39;s trainers were killed in this time of crisis... <BR> <BR>&#34;Good work again Thor...&#34;Claw hissed with a slight nod. &#34;Your buddies did a great job.&#34; <BR> <BR>Celine laughed and fluttered up, landing on the Stronghorns shoulder. &#34;He&#39;s right, you really came through.&#34; She gave him a kiss on the cheek and Ganthor turned a shade of red.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Aw, it was nothin...&#34;He said...&#34;I got connections, no what I&#39;m saying. See when you&#39;ve got connections, ow!&#34; Ganthor stopped as the dryad smacked him on the head.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t ruin it with another story that makes no sense.&#34;She said, the dryad then taking flight. &#34;I&#39;m heading over to the old Harolds ranch now. Anyone coming?&#34; Stoneclaw gave it some thought. That ranch was where Beatdown was buried, right next to her old trainer. Celine flew the skies for hours on end just to find that ranch so that the fairyhare could be laid to rest properly. She kept her promise... <BR> <BR>&#34;We better stick around, still alot of work to do.&#34; Claw replied, glancing over at the construction. &#34;With the IMA trashed we&#39;ve got to look out for ourselves...and for our own kind.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Alright then...see you later.&#34; She flew away, waving goodbye, leaving the Trident and the Stronghorn standing side bye side... <BR> <BR>&#34;Can you believe it&#39;s been three months already?&#34;Stoneclaw asked, rubbing a patch of scarred flesh on his shoulder, his skin never did grow back there. Ganthor answered him with a thoughtful nod...at least his horn had healed properly, it had been badly broken. Both fell silent for a time...before the calls of Belgras the zuum interrupted them. A pair of strong hands was needed to help finish the job.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Works never done is it? ...See you later old man.&#34; He said before he and Ganthor went off to help the others. Claw had spoken to the object that stood before them. It was a statue, marking the place of two graves that rested side by side. The work of stone depicted the image of a Durahan, strong and proud, sword raised to the heavens. Standing beside him was a human in the likeness of Cid, clutching the gem that had been passed down in his family for generations. And here they stood...Trainer and Monster, Victim and Avenger. The mighty warrior stood protectively over his trainer, defending him now even in death as he did in life...now and for the rest of forever. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>~Finally!~ <BR> <BR>It was the thought that ran through Shielka&#39;s mind as she, at long last, managed to find her master within the wreckage of the tower. He remained as he always did, frozen in time within his crystal prison. The daina attacked the stasis hold with all she had...and left not a scratch. This continued...even until night fall. At last...the fiery pixie collapsed, exhausted. She&#39;d given up...nothing could break that seal. But then...she spotted movement, the twitch of an eye...and flick of a claw and to her delight the stasis crystal began to crack and shatter...The Master was rising... <BR> <BR>&#34;Welcome back...&#34;She grinned... <BR> <BR> <BR>The End <BR> <BR>Coming soon: The Reign Of the Master
