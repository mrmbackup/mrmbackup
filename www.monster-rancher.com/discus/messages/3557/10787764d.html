 The next morning, I found that Picott was quite lazy for a monster! However, thus was easily solved, as yesterday&#39;s experience proved that Picott&#39;s favourite food was nuts. I tried some more things, and he liked almost all sweet things offered to him. He liked a few other things, but nuts still remained his favourite. <BR> <BR> We went outside to try training, and he actually did pretty well! The only problem is, while dodging an avalanche, he went too far, so I had to spend the day looking for him. We went inside, and lit a fire. Picott rolled away, and came back with his new favourite pillow. I laughed, as he curled up on his pillow and went to sleep. <BR> <BR> The next day, our neighbour, Kesha, came tearing down the mountain as her suzurin came floating down behind her. She puffed and panted as she arrived at our cabin. <BR> <BR>&#34;Quickly! We need to evacuate! There&#39;s a monster up there, a strong one! Not just strong, colossal! Come on, we need to leave now!&#34; <BR> <BR> I nodded, and turned to Picott, who was rolling back into the cabin. I called for him to stop, but he still went in. <BR> <BR>&#34;Go ahead, we&#39;ll catch up.&#34; <BR> <BR> This time she nodded, and began tearing down the path again. I called out again for Picott, and he burst right out through the door of the cabin... With his pillow. I would have laughed again, but there was a sudden rumble, an earthquake-sized rumble, and we soon found ourselves tearing down the path as fast as Kesha had ran. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>Well, thanks for the comments, peoples! More are greatly appreciated! Now, I shall think of what to write next. Hmm... I&#39;m thinking of introducing a new character, but I need ideas... Any of you want to be in it? Tell me a little about your character, and their monster, if you would. Thankies! ;&#41;
