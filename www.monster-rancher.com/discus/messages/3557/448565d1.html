 Moonshadow found himself flying through the air at a rather uncomfortable speed. He landed with a loud whack and flying dust. He rolled a few feet, landing next to the forest fringe. He struggled to stand, but he had received a rather horrific punch from Kronock. He stood slowly on shaky legs, as his now golden hair grew dim then bright, then dim again. He was weakening, they all were. <BR> <BR>&#34;Roketh…you better hurry…&#34; Moonshadow spoke under his breath before resuming his charge. <BR> <BR>Galin swung feverishly at his rival with his deadly Thermal Claw attack. He had been slowly upgrading the skill since he received it from his father, Kingston. At first, he could turn his fingers into small energy blades. Then, he managed to manifest them off the back of his wrists. Now, he held his hand in a chop position, and now his entire hand was a large, purple blade of pure energy. With four of these, he swung with everything he had. <BR> <BR>Kronock almost seemed amused as he dodged the attacks effortlessly. Then, his left hand shattered, sending flesh across the plain in which they battled. Now, a large crab&#39;s claw was in its place. In an instant, he wrapped it around Galin&#39;s waist, squeezing. Galin gasped once before plunging his bottom two hands into the claw. One bounced off, but the other found a solid strike, yet did not penetrate. The end of the blade pulsed as he pressed on it with all his strength, yet the end would not go through the tough exterior. As he pushed to no avail, Kronock laughed hysterically. Galin raised his top two arms, possibly to slash it off at the wrist. Then, another explosion rang off from Kronock&#39;s back. Flesh flew again as several tentacles flew over Kronock&#39;s head and ensnared Galin&#39;s arms. Galin screamed terribly as the pressure was about to break him in half. <BR> <BR>Being the sound of the day, a third explosion fired off, this time not from Kronock. The junction between the crab-like projection and the powerful arm of Kronock shattered. The extension loosened and fell to the ground as a surprised Kronock glanced to his left. Dadge held up his left arm, off of it was the immensely powerful Wolf-380 cannon. Kronock merely laughed again. He knew he still hand Galin with his tentacles and, just to make sure, more fired off from his back circling around him to reach their purchase, Galin. <BR> <BR>Dadge slowly raised his other arm, and out came the immense Harvenger gattling system. A stream of AP bullets shredded the tentacles in the air. Galin fell free, landing on the ground with a thud and a gasp. Kronock watched the severed appendages squirm on the ground before laying still, then he eyed Dadge in a rage. Dadge had already fired off all his ammunition by this point in the fight, and decided to use his newest upgrades now. He tapped a few buttons on his left wrist. Almost instantly, both the Wolf and the Harvenger fell to the earth. Dadge got in a comfortable stance then activated his new hand-to-hand system. His arms were both pointing down now, and two green light sabers flared from his wrists. Also, off each elbow, another green blade appeared. The ones on his wrists were strait, while these were slightly curved. Dadge prepared to fight as Kronock chuckled to himself. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well now, a human wishes to fight a monster? More so than that…&#34; Kronock spoke as if Dadge was utterly inferior, which he believed, &#34;You wish to fight the king of all monsters?&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge&#39;s response was a battle cry and a charge. Galin was up, and was also charging. Kronock then glanced to his third opponent, Moonshadow, who was charging up his horns. <BR> <BR>Kronock sighed a bit before saying, &#34;A pity. Tisk tisk, you would have made excellent slaves.&#34; <BR> <BR>Meanwhile…In the underworld… <BR> <BR>Roketh pulled on the gigantic door, and it took all his might to open it. As it slowly pulled open, Roketh was horrified. <BR> <BR>&#34;Vyger!?&#34; Roketh screamed. <BR> <BR>Vyger was sitting against the right wall of a square room. Blood trickled from his middle mouth like a stream. One eye on his left head was completely swollen shut; the other was bloodshot with a small cut above it. His right head had a sizeable gash on its chin. His left arm was around his stomach, probably holding a wound. His right lay limply on the floor, palm up. His feet were both sprawled out in the floor. He had obviously given up. <BR> <BR>Then Roketh saw who, or what, had to be Bethemos. Roketh was surprised to see it was in fact a she. A large female demon of unspeakable size and strength. Roketh was roughly up to her knee. She looked like a large, bloated human. Mostly fat, underneath Roketh assumed was considerable muscle. Two, massive horns protruded from her head, pointing left and right. Off each ear, human skeletons were hung as earrings. She had two bottom teeth that came up over her top lip, even when her mouth was shut. A round, golden nose ring was also in place. Upon further inspection, Roketh realized that it was actually a Color Pandora skeleton, all three were woven together with some kind of thread. You could barely see her burning red eyes from under her titanic eyebrows. She wore what seemed to be some kind of demon hide two piece, and Roketh was glad she at least had that. As if this wasn&#39;t bad enough, in her right hand resided a hammer, roughly the size of Roketh. <BR> <BR>&#34;Come on, little man.&#34; The beast taunted Vyger, &#34;Is that all? No wonder you ended up down here.&#34; <BR> <BR>Vyger pulled himself up while asking, &#34;What…did…you say?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I said, no wonder you were-&#34;, She stopped. She sniffed the air slightly and said, &#34;We have a visitor.&#34; <BR> <BR>She spun quickly and eyes Roketh. Roketh readied his scythe as Bethemos spoke again, almost taunting him now, &#34;Wanna play?&#34; <BR> <BR>-Roketh has found his long lost friend, but now he must battle to reclaim him. Can his strength be enough to save Vyger and the others? Will Kronock kill the other monsters?- <BR> <BR>Stay tuned! CHB

 Well, I was a bit rushed. Plus I was trying to set up meetings with my Marine recruiter and my Air Force recruiter. If I&#39;m going to college, I gotta get the money, military seems to be my only way right now.
