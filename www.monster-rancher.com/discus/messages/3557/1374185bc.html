 The Rangers were leaving the baron wasteland of the battlefield. It was a very creepy place, since it was Mahjor&#39;s last stand. Songi came to them.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Zagref, where are you going? There is much rejoicing to be done.&#34; Zagref looked at him. &#34;Songi, we must destroy Hijora. He could be the next in line to the devil gene. It must end, now.&#34; &#34;Then I am coming too.&#34; Songi said. Zagref looked at Songi, surprised. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Songi, but it is only for us. We are the only ones that can kill him.&#34; Soluv looked confused. &#34;Zagref, he could be helpful on our journey. We might need him.&#34; &#34;Come on Zagref, I could be helpful. who knows, you could go up against others more powerful than us.&#34; Zagref looked doubtful, but he allowed it.  <BR> <BR>The four went on. soon they found themselves in unknown territory. &#34;Where are we?&#34; Songi asked. &#34;We are outside the Caves of Tukiyomi. A mysterious place said to contain the most powerful source of anima, the Gaia Stone. If I were Hijora, I would come here to find it. With it, it would enhance your power greatly. He could be more powerful than all of us combined if he gets it. It would be a nightmare.&#34; Zagref said.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Rangers, go back..... Leave this place.... Never come back.....&#34; A mystery voice said. &#34;Who is there! Come out and show yourself!&#34; A figure appeared. It was Huong. &#34;Huong! What are you doing here?&#34; Solon asked. &#34;Never mind that! You must leave!&#34; Songi looked at Huong. &#34;Huong, is that you?! Do you remember me? I am Songi. Your best friend, and General....&#34; Huong looked surprised. &#34;Songi? Is that really you? I haven&#39;t seen you since....&#34; Soluv looked at Songi. &#34;You know each other?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Never mind that now. We must go and find Hijora.&#34; Zagref said. &#34;Please, I beg of you to not go in!&#34; Huong said. &#34;Huong, we must. Hijora might find the Gaia Stone, and become more powerful than Mahjor!&#34; Soluv said. &#34;NOOOOO! Oh well, it seems that I can&#39;t change your minds. Good bye, Rangers.....&#34; Huong left. &#34;Zagref, what if Huong was trying to save us from doom?&#34; Solon said. &#34;I know Huong. He can be pretty superstitious.&#34; Songi said. <BR> <BR>The four-some went in. They confronted many stray and hateful enemies. Every room they entered, it seemed that the atmosphere got thicker. Then they came to a room, and felt themselves holding around 200 lbs. more on their body weight. &#34;Argh, I feel like I&#39;ve been carrying Songi for hours.&#34; Soluv said. &#34;Yea, and the atmosphere feels much heavier. Everything looks much darker.&#34; Songi said. &#34;It feels like something is watching us.&#34; Zagref said. <BR> <BR>All of a sudden, their was a great, black orb in front of them. A black Raiden appeared. &#34;I am the great servant of &#34;Aum&#34;, the Great and Powerful. Who dares enter his domain!?&#34; &#40;Aum, why does this name sound familiar?&#41; Zagref thought. That was when he remembered Huong, back at the Fortress of Mahjor....&#34;I am the ghost of Huong, once a Seuzo, but taken down by &#34;Aum&#34;, the right hand of Mahjor....&#34; Zagref was struck by fear. &#34;Aum! He is the right hand of Mahjor!&#34; The others looked at him and were then lost in their memories. &#34;If you wish to see him, you must complete my task. You must survive me in battle.&#34; The Raiden said. <BR> <BR>&#34;We will defeat you and your pathetic allies, Black Raiden.&#34; Songi said. The Four battled the Raiden, and his minions. Songi ran towards them and slammed on of the Raiden&#39;s minions. It was a Black Tiger. Soluv used vulcan fire, and shot it at the Raiden. Zagref made a meteor, and shot it at a Black Garu. Solon used his soul saber and slashed at a Black Gaboo. The &#34;Black Ones&#34;, as they were called, returned with a union attack. It slammed the four. They were sent flying. &#34;AAAAAARGH!&#34; They all shouted. Zagref managed to get up. &#34;The Black Ones are powerful, but we can use our death formation!&#34; Zagref said. The Rangers made a triangular formation, and blasted a very bright beam at the ceiling of the cave. It formed the Seal of Lot. Then it came down as blue fire upon the Black Ones. They were incinerated instantly. <BR> <BR>&#34;.....WOW!!!!&#34; That was the greatest move I have ever seen, except for the Orb of Lot, which he used on Mahjor to kill him.&#34; Songi said. <BR> <BR>After the battle, the Four saw the Raiden again. &#34;What the... I thought we killed you!?&#34; Soluv said. &#34;I cannot be killed unless Aum is killed, which is highly unlikely.&#34; The Raiden said. &#34;Take us to HIM immiediatly!!&#34; Zagref said. &#34;Very well...&#34; The Raiden led them to a dark room. There was an saucer in the middle. &#34;Is that the saucer for Aum?&#34; Soluv asked. &#34;Yes. You must strike it to awaken him.&#34; Solon went to it. He was about to smack it, when Hijora took it, and incinerated it. &#34;Hahahahaaaa! Aum now is dead. And I stand as the only Devil presently,&#34; then Hijora took out a shining stone, &#34;And with the....Gaia Stone in my possesion, I am undefeatable!!!&#34; The Four were shocked. &#34;NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&#34; Zagref yelled in frustration. <BR> <BR>Then, Hijora raised his fist, and sent thousands of demons and those of Black anima, and sent them throughout the world. Everything turned Black, the plants, the trees, the walls, everything. Hijora was all powerful. &#34;No..... We lost....&#34; <BR> <BR>To be continued.....

 Not bad Sturnum. Not bad. Noticed the reference to anima. I got a little confused though. Was the Huong they met the same as before?

 Yes. It was. He was warning them that Aum was there, but Aum never gets out. By the way, what is up with your bro, Waddafxup? He hasen&#39;t been around for a while.

 My bro, Waddafxup, actually tried to type the next chapter in his story, but something happened. Up until then he had wrote out his chapters on paper before he typed them, as I do. But he decided that it just wasted time and typed it without writing it. After about three hours of typing, the internet cut him off and those hours of typing were lost. He&#39;s been busy writing as many chapters as he can before he types so this doesn&#39;t reoccur. I don&#39;t know how much longer it&#39;ll take, but be patient, hopefully it will be soon. Plus football has kept him busy.
