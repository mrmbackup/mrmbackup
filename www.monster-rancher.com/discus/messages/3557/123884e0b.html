<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
Rick scratched the back of his head, as he watched the news. He sat back in his recliner and sighed as he tried to swallow a knot in his throat. He had lost his job and saw America once again attacking the Middle East for oil. It’s a recurring thing, in George Bush’s two terms of presidency he had been in those countries trying to get oil, secretly. Now it’s a large announcement that they want oil.  <BR> <BR>Rick laughed dryly as he kept his eyes fixated on the television screen. Then the power went out. He wasn’t going to pay ten thousand dollars a month just to keep the electricity. His eyes slowly turned to his air conditioner. The room temperature was still about 75 degrees just because of the heat. Rick continued to sit in his little apartment; he realized what was going to happen. Very few people could even began to fathom the catastrophic events that may happen.   <BR> <BR>He went to slip on some jeans as he tried to slide them over his sweat drenched legs. He reached over for a belt and then proceeded to slide that through the slots designated for a belt. He took a few steps and clawed around in his dresser trying to find a shirt. He found the one he had normally used for work, and then underneath it was a white one with a bit of a tear on the right shoulder.  <BR> <BR>He went over to his door knob and tried to grasp it, but his hands were too sweaty to get a grip. He went to whip off his hands on his pant leg and then reached over to grab the door knob once more. Then the sweat his had hands before prevented him from getting a grip that time. He said a few curse words and whipped off both his hands and his door knob and opened up the door.  <BR> <BR>He took a step outside. To someone not accustom to the scorching heat of the Texas morning would be in a great deal of pain as the afternoon came. Rick had lived here all his life and never had a problem with it being overly hot. He took a few steps down from the apartment. He lived on the first floor which was convenient because there was no elevator and he loathes walking steps.  <BR> <BR>He slid his hand down the weathered handrail as he walked along a few fences towards the local Speedway, his shoes seemed to stick to the ground as he walked, and he could swear he saw water ahead, but he knew better and that it was a mirage. The lady wasn’t kidding when she said gas prices were going to skyrocket; they had already gone near triple digits as he stared in awe at the immense price. A drop of gas would cost nearly 10 cents.  At the Speedway was a lady, she was crying as she punched her small 2012 Ford Mustang. Exclaiming curse words as she hit her car as it may do something useful. He continued to walk down to the gas station. Tears streaked down the woman’s read face as she slid her hand through her hair and sat down. <BR> <BR>He stepped in and the customer bell rang. An Asian man sat down moping over the counter. He was looking at the ground tapping the desk without any beat or rhythm.   <BR> <BR>“If you’ve come to rob me you might as well go away. I have no money.” He said as tears formed at the edge of his eyes. His glasses had been fogged up, due to the heat? Rick wondered.  <BR> <BR>“I’m not here to rob you. I just want something to drink.” Rick said as he walked over to the refrigerated section. He opened it, expecting a cool brisk feeling, but got nothing.  <BR> <BR>“We couldn’t afford anything. I’m going to lose this store by the end of the week if I don’t come up with two million dollars. The Asian man said mournfully as his tears hit the ground, only to evaporate within minutes. Rick felt a sharp pain in his stomach when he heard that. The Asian man continued.  <BR> <BR>“I have kids and a wife at home…” He said as he sniffed up snot and tears fell and streaked his face. “There are almost no jobs open. Not even Johnstone knows what to do. The war in the Middle East is pointless. It will only lower the population, that’s why he’s sending people.”  <BR> <BR>The crying got louder as he continued as he started to speak once more.  <BR> <BR>“Those troops aren’t coming home, he sent them to die.”  <BR> <BR>Rick walked out of the store with the warm soda in had. He took a sip and spat out the grotesquely warm liquid that had no right to be called a ‘soft drink’ and he tossed it aside. Leaving the litter on the ground. The Texas heat took care of the liquid and dried it up. He continued to swagger down throughout the town. Many stores were closing down because they couldn’t afford the cost of the electricity. He thought he’d see looting, but then chuckled at the pure thought.  <BR> <BR>“The looters also couldn’t afford it.”  <BR> <BR>He sat on a bench and thought for a second. There has to be other alternatives for power. A politician had brought up the idea of rebuilding the Hoover dam, which had since been destroyed by terrorist action back in 2013. This also forced the states dependent on it to convert to using oil so they can power up the states once more. This used up a lot of oil which took a lot more oil from other places and raised prices.  <BR> <BR>Rick rubbed his chin with his blistered hands. He didn’t get a chance to shave to his face was unkempt and full of little stubs. He rocked back and forth on the bench causing it to creak. He was trying to think of possible alternatives. He knew hydroelectricity wouldn’t be possible, because it would cost too much for the oil and by the time they got half way done they’d have no more oil to help build the dam.  <BR> <BR>His eyes widened in horror as he remembered the last test on Nuclear Fusion. It was an apocalyptic new announcement as it wiped out the test site and evaporated the buildings and people within 50 miles. It was a modern day Chernobyl as put by some new paper reporters. It was obviously the world couldn’t handle that kind of power and use it correctly without failure. The radioactivity keeps the place, which the location has been kept secret even though the event is still well known, uninhabitable for at least 50 more years.   <BR> <BR>Solar power itself cost more oil then needed. Solar power was labeled inefficient and almost useless by many scientists before the nuclear accident. Then the effort to get solar power to be the main energy source was over shadowed by other sources.   <BR> <BR>Rick closed his stress filled eyes for a moment and then a crazed man ran up and down the streets screaming of the horror, death and how there is no more hope. Rick leaned forward as he wiped sweat from his prickly cheek and watched the man become shunned by the peers around him. The lunatic finally took a break and sat down next to Rick.  <BR> <BR>Agitated Rick firmly asks what was wrong and the man slowly uttered.  <BR> <BR>“Johnstone killed himself.”  <BR> <BR>The president who was supposed to help get these people through the crisis had taken the easy way out. It’s almost shameful that the easy way out was to “X” yourself Rick thought. He began to ponder what would happen. Does the vice president really want this attention? Rick stood up and slowly walked to his apartment parking lot. He was going to visit a friend of his. <BR> <BR>---  <BR> <BR>Oh man, this is getting boring. Almost no motivation. I&#39;m thinking of ending it at Chapter 4.
