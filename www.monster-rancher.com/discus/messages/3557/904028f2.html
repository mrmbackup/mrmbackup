 Hello all, <BR> <BR>This is GARLANT the author of the excellent &#40;in my opinion&#41; Kain Saga.  Well just so everyone knows I am to write again! Prepare for a new saga/epic. <BR> <BR>This story will be a little interesting/confusing.  Whereas in my last story i used monsters, techs and training methods from &#34;monster rancher 2&#34; It will now be set with characters, techs and training methods from a combination of both &#34;Monster Rancher 2&#34; and &#34;Monster Rancher Advanced 2&#34;.  It may get a little confusing but try to bare with me.  Anyway the prolouge: <BR> <BR>The first thing most monsters hear is their own heartbeat.  A steady thump that is the most comforting sound to all monsters.  Humans have the blessing of the scent and sound of their mothers but monsters being created either through written words, disk stones or a combination of their &#34;parents&#34; have no such luck.   <BR> <BR>Thump...Thump....Thump <BR> <BR>The eye of the newly created monster slowly opened.  Light sprung into his eye and a bright red eye lid immediately covered it again.  Slowly another eye opened and this time stayed open as a shape came into focus.  The shape was a teenage boy.  His name was Namis.  Namis was tall, medium build with long black hair.  His face showed a look of happyness and intrigue.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Hello.....hmmm...&#34; Namis stuttered.  He turned to face the lab assistant.  <BR> <BR>&#34;I would like to name him Leo please&#34;.  Namis said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Very well, ill register him with that name.&#34; <BR> <BR>The lab assistant dissapeared behin a pair of double doors and Namis turned to face his monster.  <BR> <BR>Leo was an antlan.  He was not a regular antlan however.  Where the pure breed had dark, sea blue, Leo had a burning and piercing red and instead of golden horns his horns was a deep purple.  He was a Gaurdian, an antlant with the sub breed of a garu.  He slowly stood up on tiny red feet, his eyes still slightly adjusting, and beamed a smile at his owner.   <BR> <BR>To be continued...
