<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>Jello</B> on <B>Tuesday, August 22, 2000 - 05:22 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 I need to get to know my characters.  The story is about a bunch of Jells &#40;4&#41; who have been sent by no one in particular to kill Burner, the Evil Jell that somehow got a Phoenix sub-type. Ayway, here are the characters: <BR> <BR>Minion-a Chloro Jell.  Tough, rough, and a ruthless guy, he shows no kindness to anyone.  He is evan tough with his best friend, Scaler.  He uses his brain and wits to win,  however, in reality he is soft on the inside, too. <BR> <BR>Scaler-a Scaled Jell. Soft, kind, yet smart, he is Minion’s best friend.  Sometimes he can go crazy-called the Bloodlust-and then he is indestructable.  However, after the Bloodlust, you die. &#40;More on that later in the story.&#41; <BR> <BR>Mr.Freeze-a pure Jell. The leader of the group, he is all brains.  However, he doesn’t use it for the right purposes.  He cares about himself and money, and that’s basically it.  He won’t last long, I assure you. <BR> <BR>Baxter-a Worm Jell. The kid of the group, at a young age forced into battle. A brave fighter, if it looks like he’s gonna die, he will keep fightin until he can no longer fight. Minion hates him due to some family problems ages before either of them was born. <BR> <BR>Gengen-a Wall Mimic. Not a bad Jell as far as they go, he has one drawback though. He trusts people easily.  It might lead him to a nasty end. <BR> <BR>Deed-a Mono Eyed.  Minion hates his guts.  He is an annoying little runt, but Scaler got him for his second birthday.  He is very cocky and, well, I can’t call him brave, more like stupid. <BR> <BR> <BR>These brave young Jells-and Mono Eyed- go on a journey to kill evil...they have many sad things happen, yet the friends they make make it all worthwile.  Friends they will make that I know so far: <BR> <BR>Big Bob, a Gobi, Zimbo, an Omega, Hanger, a Henger, and much, much more!  Story coming soon. <BR> <BR> <BR>		Chapter 1:The Jell&#39;s first battle <BR> <BR>		“Ya think the War Council will find us? Do ya? Do ya? Huh? Do ya?” <BR>	Deed was being annoying as usual.  The pesky little Mono Eyed’s specialty was being annoying.  But Scaler answered him nicely, as usual. <BR>	“Yes, Deed. But they will-” <BR>He was interrupted by his best friend, Minion.  “They’ll rip out your throat and tear you to pieces, then eat you for lunch, or maybe supper.”  Minion was annoyed at all this B.S. that Deed was giving him. <BR>	Scaler just laughed. “They’ll just let us go.  Remember, they want Burner killed.  They sent out hundreds of warriors just to kill him .  So what if we snuck out to get rid of him?  They think it will be a bunch of casualties unpaid for.  But we’ll get him,” Scaler told him. <BR>	Mr.Freeze grunted. “As long as they pay us,” he said.  “A lot.” <BR>	They were walking up their first mountain, a bare, ugly place with the smell of death in the air.  No one liked it.  Baxter was on full alert, looking everywhere, jumping at every sound. Gengen was wondering what joke to say next. Mr. Freeze was thinking about how much money they HAD to get for their troubles.  Minion was trying to figure out how to somehow leave Deed behind on this mountain.  Deed was trying his best to be annoying, and Scaler was turning into a helicopter to try to scope out the land ahead.  <BR>	“Three scruffy-looking monsters, a Gordish, a Kato, and a Blue Kato ahead.  They have cutlasses and look like trouble.  I don’t think they are from Burner’s troops though,” Scaler called down from the sky. <BR>	Mr.Freeze groaned.  He didn’t want this fight. “Stop!” a voice called. “Who dares pass the territory of the Katos From Hell?” <BR>	Minion snorted.  “They look like my two-year old nephew’s tricycle gang, Heck’s Angels, as they call themselves,” he whispered to his friends. <BR>	The Gordish overheard him.  “Die!” he screamed, running straight at Minion.   <BR>	For some reason, Minion wasn’t afraid of him.  Mr.Freeze was.  Mr.Freeze turned his arm into a sword himself and started fighting.  The Blue Kato was approaching Baxter.  Mr.Freeze panicked. He ran away from the battle.  Minion and Scaler tut-tutted. Gengen made a wall around Baxter and took the hits.  Minion just molded his hand into a machine gun and shot all three Katos.  Gengen and Scaler were looking at him in awe.  <BR>	“Now why didn’t I think of that?” Gengen and Scaler were thinking. <BR>	Baxter was pretty shaken up.  <BR>	“Come on. Let’s go find the wimp,” Minion said like nothing happened.  “We cannot do that once we reach the other side of the mountain.  Magic enforces that no weapons can be molded by our hands.” <BR>	Deed, being Deed, was  asleep.  He had slept through the whole battle!  And that is how the Journey of the Jells started. <BR> <BR> <BR>THE JOURNEY OF THE JELLS <BR> <BR>	Chapter 2:The Lowest Battle <BR> <BR>	“Mr.Freeze? Where are you? The battle is over!”  The Jells were calling for their so-called leader who had run away from a battle. <BR>	Mr.Freeze came out shamefully  from behind a tree.  The blue Jell was now reddish. “I, uh, you know,thought I saw a Ninja Kato, so, you know, I went after him.  But he got away.  Damn, I  almost had him too!” <BR>	Minion was looking at him shaking his head.  Scaler couldn’t belive it.  Gengen was looking at him, feeling sorry for him.  Baxter was wondering why he was the leader of the group.  Deed was asleep.  They reached the other side of the mountain, the ParePare forest to their right, open territory to their left.  Straight ahead was  their path.  Suddenly, Scaler shoved everyone into the bushes.  “WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT FOR???” bellowed Mr.Freeze. <BR>	“Shut up,” Scaler tried to quiet him.   <BR>	Mr.Freeze jumped out of the bush angrily.  BOOOMMMM! A huge explosion, and Jell blood sprayed everywhere.  “They know were we are!” Minion yelled.  “Battle!” <BR>	It was a long and drawn out fight between the Jells and the attacking troops, with uniforms that had a patch of Burner on and words that said: 10TH TROOP.  OUTSKIRTS OF PAREPARE.  It was the lowest troop in the lowest patrol with the lowest captain of all of Burner’s army.  A couple of Jokers fell dead.  This was a land without Lost Disks. A Nyankaro body tripped up Gengen, who was looking up at the sword of a Joker.  Suddenly, lasers were everywhere.  Burner’s troops were looking confused for a second then fell dead.  Three Hengers, an Omega, a pure Henger, and a Black Henger were fighting alongside the Jells.  Only one of the army was remaining after half an hour of battling.  It was the captain, a Wracky.  It smiled. <BR>	“Do you think you will ever defeat me?  I may be the lowest captain, but I will soon rise, and you are powerless against me,” it said, eyes shining red.     <BR>	It leaped toward the Omega, knocking the Henger down, and raised the knife it carried.  “Say goodbye to your friend!” It screamed, plunging the blade toward the poor Omega.  But the Black Henger stretched over its friend, so the Wracky buried the knife deep in it’s heart.  Then Scaler saw Deed, who had been awakened from all the screaming.  He whispered to Deed, “Kill him from behind. He doesn’t know about you. You are our only hope!” Suddenly, the Wracky screamed, and fell to the ground, dead.  The Jells had paid back the Wracky, and Deed bit its neck, breaking it and killing the evil Wracky.  It didn’t know about Deed, as it was sleeping when they were attacked.  Minion immediately went to the side of the Black Henger, and saw that its eyes were closed in peace.  The Henger and Omega were crying for their brother.   <BR>“I’m sorry,” Minion said softly.  Then he had an idea. “But you can avenge his death by joining forces with us and killing Burner, whose troops killed your brother.  May I ask what your names are?”  <BR>	“I’m Hanger,” the Henger said. “This is Zimbo.  What are your names?” <BR>	Minion introduced himself and his buddies.  “We each lost our own,” Minion said softly. “But I can’t exactly say I’m sorry Mr.Freeze is dead.  He actually is the one who killed your brother.  The troop would have passed us by with no notice if he had not jumped out.  Who will be our new leader?” he glanced around. <BR>	Scaler laughed.  “I think it is a unquestioned decision that you are our new leader.” <BR>	Minion nodded.  “Then we continue our journey north.” <BR>And so our Mr.Freeze-less Jells and new friends continue their journey to kill the evil Burner.  Little did they know that the road would have more problems to solve, and much more casualties.  What will happen next?
