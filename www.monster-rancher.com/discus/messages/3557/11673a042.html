 Part XIV The Moment Arrives <BR> <BR>Hannah sat in her cell miles beneath the Mandy Desert, staring blankly at the walls. She was waiting, waiting for the right time. The minutes passed, the hours passed, the days passed, and then something averted her attention from the wall to hallway beyond her cell door. Some sort of great commotion was going on. She felt a terrible rumbling. Her monsters sensed it too. The rumbling got stronger. She heard men and monsters scurrying outside the door. The rumbling got stronger. Someone was unlocking the door to her cell. The rumbling got stronger. It got too much for the cave ceiling of her cell. One of the stalactites broke loose, and shot towards her Gaboo. Much to Hannah’s gratefulness, her Marble Guy blocked the falling rock with a swipe of his arm, breaking the chains attached to it. “Great job, Cat’s Eye! Now, quickly break Cookie-Dough’s chains and then come and free me.” The Golem obeyed without hesitation. He had just finished undoing Hannah’s bonds when the guard came through the door, panting, looking very relieved. The two monsters lied still, pretending to still be imprisoned.  <BR>	 <BR>“&#42;pant, pant&#42; I’m glad &#42;pant, pant&#42; to see that &#42;pant, pant&#42; you have not been harmed. &#42;pant, pant&#42; You will come with me. &#42;pant&#42; I have been ordered to relocate you to a less, uh, now what was it the boss said? Oh, never mind. Anyways, you will come with me. Well? Hurry up!” Hannah, and her monsters, stood up slowly, the chains slipping off them. <BR> <BR>“Your right. I do have to leave, but not with you! Actually, I don’t believe that you will be leaving at all. Get him, boys.” At a signal from Hannah, the Gaboo and Marble Guy grabbed the guard and tied him up, putting him in her cell. “Let’s see how you like it. Although, I’m afraid you wont have to be in there long…” She could see the panic on the guard’s face. She was playing him just right. <BR> <BR>“No! No! Please! I’ll do anything you want!” He was crying, which was quite a funny sight. He had just said the exact words that she had wanted to hear. This moment, the one she had been planning and waiting for had finally come. She had to hurry. The rumblings had increased in power and frequency two-fold.  <BR> <BR>“Alright, just stop the blubberin’. You know the way out of this place, a quick way, correct?” <BR> <BR>“Yes.” The guard was quivering with terror. Both the Gaboo and Marble Guy were hovering over him with a stare that could stop a Zilla on a rampage. <BR> <BR>“You will get us out of here, and the quickest way possible, mind you.” She had him. <BR> <BR>“Of course! Thank you! Thank you, kind soul!” He bent down and kissed her feet. “I, Julius, am forever your servant.” <BR> <BR>“Ugh! Your welcome, just stop kissing my feet. We must hurry now. This whole underground fortress is about to cave in, killing us all.” Hannah and Julius sped down the hallway, dodging stalactites as they went, and the occasional guard. They were never given any trouble. All Julius had to do was explain that he was getting the prisoners out. They came to a bridge, and were about to cross it, when a huge boulder came crashing down, totally wiping out the bridge. Hannah despaired. “How the heck are we supposed the cross this, now?” <BR> <BR>“Not to worry, Miss, uh, what’s your last name?” <BR> <BR>“It’s Wagonblast.” <BR> <BR>“Ok, then, not to worry Miss Wajonto—Witano—uh Miss,” he looked quite embarrassed, “we can get across and up on my Beaklon, Angelo. He’s much faster than any Dragon, can carry a heavy load, and looks a lot cooler to boot!” Hannah’s glare quickly stopped his ramblings. “Oh,  right.” He put his fingers to his mouth, and gave a shrill whistle. A loud buzzing was heard overhead, and Angelo—a great giant black beetle—appeared. “Everybody board! Quickly!” Hannah and Julius got on its back while the humongous Beaklon grabbed both Cookie-Dough and Cat’s Eye and shot into the air, all in one great movement. They were just in time, too, for a boulder bigger than Angelo fell on the spot that they were standing on. Hannah was in for the ride of her life. <BR> <BR>The Beaklon sped through the collapsing cave, barely missing many a falling debris. This weaving in and out gave Hannah a feeling she had never experienced before. It was a feeling that had exhilaration, fear, and air sickness all jumbled into one. Suddenly, she felt a sharp and burning pain in the back of her head. Darkness clouded her eyes.  “Miss! Miss! That’s just perfect! She’s been knocked out with a rock” The Beaklon too a steep dive, and then a sharp left. “Good work, Angelo!” Julius looked up. “Crap! The way is blocked by a mass of sand. Do you think that you can make it?” Angelo made a rumble of agreement. “Good. Now, everybody hold oooooon!” <BR> <BR> <BR>Hey All. Well, that&#39;s part XIV of the story. I hope you enjoyed it. Comments and criticism, both good and bad, are always appreciated!

 Thanks for the comment. I wasn&#39;t exactly going for the reader to have compassion towards Julius, but it&#39;s good to at least have a reader!
