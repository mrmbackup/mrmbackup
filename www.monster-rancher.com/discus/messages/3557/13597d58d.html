 The rangers were standing outside of the Dark Fortress. They looked around. Blood, bodies, poison. A green mist was looming around. It smelt like waste. The quietness of their surroundings was eerie... Suddenly, a gaboo jumped out. It&#39;s eyes were red, it&#39;s body was black, and it had a symbol on it&#39;s fore head. It looked like a skull with a star in the middle. It attacked the rangers with a fist of fury. The rangers dodged. They attacked back. &#34;Ranger Vulcan Force!!!&#34; The rangers shot at the gaboo with fire. But the gaboo was not the easiest gaboo. It took the Vulcan fire, but remained digilante. It did a special dance, the dance of Mahjor. This special dance took control of monsters, and put them under his control. But before he could finish the dance, the rangers quickly finished the gaboo with a Meteor attack. &#34;If Mahjor has more monsters like this guy, we&#39;ll end up being controlled by him. That gaboo almost finished the Mahjor Minuet.&#34; Solon said. Zagref looked a little concerned. &#34;Did you see that symbol on it&#39;s fore head? That symbol looks familiar.&#34; The rangers were stumped by this question. &#34;That symbol must have something to do with Mahjor. The gaboo was not fighting on it&#39;s own. It looked like it had no expression. It was not angry, or sad. It just looked straight ahead.&#34; Soluv said. Hijora was a little impatient. &#34;It was nothing. Now lets go. Every second we haven&#39;t defeated Mahjor, he gets more powerful.&#34; The rangers went along. But Solon looked suspiciously at Hijora. &#34;Hijora, we don&#39;t have to go just yet. I smell trouble around.&#34; Soluv was looking squimish. &#34;That was me. I ate a Potatoe before we left.&#34; The rangers looked at Soluv. &#34;Arrgh, fine lets go.&#34; Solon said. The rangers went a little farther. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Solon asks: &#34;Hey Hijora, how come you always were that turban. It&#39;s pretty hot in here, why don&#39;t you take it off?&#34; Hijora looks at him with rage. &#34;I don&#39;t need your opinion on what I should and shouldn&#39;t wear, alright!&#34; The rangers decided it was safe in the room that they were in, and decided to go to sleep. The fortress was huge, and it took days to get to the grand hall. They went to sleep. Zagref had a dream that was very mysterious. He dremt that Lot was in front of him. &#34;Zagref, you must listen to me well. You must have great leadership skills. There is one who will betray you. One who is working for Mahjor. His identity, I can&#39;t tell you but he is the great betrayer. He has been written about for centuries. You must know that he will silently find out all of your weaknesses. He is secretly plotting against you. He will silently bring you down. one by one. Know that he has been plotting for quite some time now. You must learn this. So you will not fall into his ploy. I must leave you now, Zagref. I will protect you and the other rangers. But you must do the hard jobs yourself. Goodbye.&#34; Lot left, and Zagref awoke. He told the other rangers about the dream, about the warnings, and about the &#34;Great Betrayer&#34;. The rangers were angry that Mahjor would come to these extremes. They were afraid that the betrayer would destroy them soon. They sat in the room silently. Thinking: &#34;Who could be the betrayer?&#34; <BR> <BR>To be continued...
