 Hm, nothing&#39;s been going on in the library for a while so I&#39;ve decided to parody the song, &#34;Like a Bat Out of Hell&#34; by Meatloaf. It&#39;s kinda strange because its supposed to be a rancher talking to his last monster, a hare. Well, here it is. Enjoy! <BR> <BR>Like a Pair Out of Hell! to the tune of &#34;Like a Bat Out of Hell copyright Meatloaf. <BR> <BR>The crowd is screaming and the monsters are howling, <BR>Way down in the coliseum tonight. <BR>There&#39;s a Dragon in the shadows with a gleam in his eye, <BR>And fangs shining oh so bright. <BR>There&#39;s evil in the air and there&#39;s thunder in sky, <BR>And a Naga’s on the bloodshot streets. <BR>Oh and down in Takrama where the dead are rising, <BR>Oh I swear I saw a monster down in the desert, <BR>He was starting to foam in the heat. <BR> <BR>Oh Hare you&#39;re the only thing in this whole ranch, <BR>That&#39;s pure and ready to fight. <BR>And wherever you are and wherever you go, <BR>We&#39;re always gonna win in the night. <BR>But you gotta get out there, <BR>you gotta break it out now, <BR>Before the final ring of the bell. <BR>So we gotta make the most of our fight together. <BR>When it&#39;s over you know, <BR>We&#39;ll both be so well known. <BR> <BR>Like a pair out of hell <BR>We&#39;ll be champions when the morning comes. <BR>When the monster fight is over <BR>Like a pair out of hell <BR>We&#39;ll have won won won. <BR>Like a pair out of hell <BR>We&#39;ll be champions when the morning comes. <BR>But when the day is done and the sun goes down, <BR>And the moonlights shining through, <BR>Then like a psycho before the gates of hell, <BR>We&#39;ll come crashing into you. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re gonna hit the monsters like a battering ram, <BR>On a silver phantom bike. <BR>When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry, <BR>And we&#39;re all about to start the fight. <BR>Nothing ever grows in this rotting old ranch. <BR>The other monsters are stunted and lost. <BR>And nothing really rocks <BR>And nothing really rolls <BR>And nothing&#39;s ever worth the cost. <BR>And I know that I&#39;m damned if I don’t win now, <BR>And maybe I&#39;m damned if I do, <BR>But with every other beat I&#39;ve got left in my heart, <BR>You know I&#39;d rather be damned with you. <BR>If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned, <BR>Rolling through the fight with you. <BR>If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned. <BR>Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned. <BR>If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned, <BR>Rolling through the night <BR>Winning through the night <BR>Crashing through the night with you. <BR> <BR>Oh Hare you&#39;re the only thing in this whole ranch, <BR>That&#39;s pure and ready to fight. <BR>And wherever you are and wherever you go, <BR>We&#39;re always gonna win in the night. <BR>But you gotta get out there, <BR>You gotta break it out now, <BR>Before the final ring of the bell. <BR>So we gotta make the most of our one fight together. <BR>When it&#39;s over you know, <BR>We&#39;ll both be so well known. <BR> <BR>Like a pair out of hell <BR>We&#39;ll be champions when the morning comes. <BR>When the monster fight is over <BR>Like a pair out of hell <BR>We&#39;ll have won won won. <BR>Like a pair out of hell <BR>We&#39;ll be champions when the morning comes. <BR>But when the day is done and the sun goes down, <BR>and the moonlights shining through, <BR>Then like a psycho before the gates of hell, <BR>We&#39;ll come crashing into you. <BR> <BR>I can see us now tearing up the others, <BR>Faster than any other rancher has ever gone. <BR>And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe. <BR>No one&#39;s gonna stop us now, <BR>I gotta earn my claim to fame. <BR>But I can&#39;t stop thinking of you, <BR>and I never see the sudden attack until it&#39;s way too late. <BR>I never see the sudden attack &#39;till it&#39;s way too late. <BR> <BR>Then I&#39;m dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun of Takrama. <BR>Torn and twisted at the foot of a dying dream. <BR>And I think somebody somewhere must be taking my place at the top. <BR>And the last thing I see is our cause, <BR>Still yearning, <BR>Breaking out of my mind, <BR>And drifting away, <BR>Like a pair out of hell. <BR>Then I&#39;m dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun of Takrama. <BR>Torn and twisted at the foot of a dying dream. <BR>And I think somebody somewhere must be taking my place at the top. <BR>And the last thing I see is our cause. <BR>Still yearning, still yearning, <BR>Breaking out of my mind  <BR>Drifting and drifting away, <BR>Like a pair out of hell. <BR>Like a pair out of hell. <BR>Like a pair out of hell. <BR>Oh like a pair out of hell! <BR>Oh like a pair out of hell! <BR>Like a pair out of hell!!! <BR> <BR>Hope you liked it! -Icelord13

 Very good work here! Longer songs are always harder to work on, and you did a great job with making it interesting.
