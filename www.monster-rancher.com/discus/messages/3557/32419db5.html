<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF='mailto:seliah@guildworld.com'>Seliah du'Kasi Shr'Lan</A></B> on <B>Sunday, February 18, 2001 - 10:19 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 Chapter Two <BR> <BR>Midnight saw to it that the faery was comfortable, and safe, inside the room, and then on instinct, decided to take up a guard position outside her door. The child was exhausted…anyone could see that. She’d obviously had a rough journey, and he was not about to see her captured and collared because of the need for sleep. <BR>As he took up his position outside her door, he saw a flurry of activity in a room across the hallway. Narrowing his eyes, and moving a hand to one of the blades on his belt, he took a step away from the doorway, watching the suspected room closely. This place did not cater to slavers, that was why he’d chosen it for them. <BR>As soon as he moved from the door his suspicions were confirmed as he heard the hiss of a dart, and felt something sting the side of his neck. Grumbling, he slapped the dart away, shaking his head. Zaret had apparently followed them up here, even. He unsheathed his favorite knife, the double-edged one, and shook his head again, feeling slightly dizzy as he moved towards the other room, which had the door open.  <BR> <BR>Another hiss, a split second before he felt something else sting his neck, told him that somebody was shooting darts at him. Dizzy, and realizing quickly that he won’t be able to fight shortly, he moved back to the faery’s room, slamming the door shut loud enough to wake her up. He wiped away the trickle of blood from his neck where the darts had stung him, and looked to the now awake, and instantly alert Seliah. <BR> <BR>“M’lady, you need to get downstairs. Do not concern yourself with your things. You haven’t the time. Get downstairs, and go to the tender at the bar. Tell him Midnight sent you, and he will hide you. I haven’t much longer, before the darts take effect…I cannot protect you at the moment…” <BR> <BR>He shook his head as his eyes started rolling up, and looked at the faery. She nodded once, in understanding, but grabbed her bag and staff anyway, and bolted from the room. Midnight moved out of the room as well, just in time to hear another hiss. Apparently the faery’s hearing was keener than his own, for she ducked, and the dart tacked itself to the wall instead as she jumped down the stairs, her wings fluttering open just enough to prevent her jump from being a fall, and the white hair flying behind her. He watched her disappear around the corner of the stairway, and then turned to the room. <BR> <BR>A third dart stung him in the neck, and he only had time to recognize Zaret’s features as the man ran downstairs after Seliah before passing out from the tranquilizer inside the darts. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Seliah ducked around the corner of the stairs, her white hair flying behind her and made for the bar. The tender looked up, seeing her haste, and lifted a brow as she moved towards him quickly, but silently. <BR> <BR>“Midnight sent me.” Was all she said to him. <BR>The tender nodded, and waved an arm for her to come behind the bar. She started to move that way, but felt a dart sting her neck. Cursing softly, she pulled it out, and turned around, to see Zaret come down the stairs. The low noise of the patrons within the tavern’s main room served well enough to hide the sound of the hiss when the dart had been shot. Singing softly for a moment, she sent a medium fireball his way, watching as it landed squarely in the man’s chest.  <BR> <BR>“Milady, come…now, before I can no longer help.” The tender insisted. Without further delay, Seliah moved behind the bar, watching the tender open a compartment in the floor. He lifted a door, and looked up at her. “There’s a room down there, with all that you will need for a week. Do not come out unless myself or Midnight announce ourselves.” <BR> <BR>Seliah nods once, and starts to bend down, already feeling lightheaded. She was much smaller than Midnight, no doubt the tranquilizer would take effect sooner for her. She shakes her head suddenly, feeling a second dart slap into her back and looks at the floor, unable to distinguish which opening was the right one. <BR> <BR>She looked up to the tender, to ask which one she needed to go into, but saw the man fall over, unconscious. On closer look, he had a blade stuck in his chest. Muttering under her breath again, Seliah stood up fully, and unleashed a large fireball at the slaver. <BR> <BR>By now, they had gained the attention of the other patrons inside the tavern, and three men were already at the bar, approaching the now flaming Zaret. The slaver simply smiled, and looked at Seliah, waiting for the darts to take effect as he swatted out the flames on his shirt.  <BR>Seliah started to sing again, but felt her tongue falter. No…I canna allow this…she thought, desperately trying to fend off the blackness that was already at the edges of her vision. Zaret smiled sickeningly at her, seemingly ignoring the three men behind him, and Seliah saw the ground move up to her as she sank into the depths of unconsciousness, her bag and staff sliding behind her. The staff stopping against the bar, the bag falling into the trap door that was a mere three feet away from her… <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Zaret smiled thinly as the winged angel finally passed out on the floor. She was going to bring in a lot of gold, and Orion paid very well for his slaves. Especially for his pleasure slaves. And this one was a beauty. Motioning silently at the three men behind him, he stood back, glaring down at his ruined shirt, and burnt skin. She was going to be sorry she’d done that. <BR> <BR>With a nod, one of the men reached down, and matter-of-factly lifted the faery up from the floor with ease. She was small, really. Only five feet tall, and maybe a hundred pounds, waterlogged. The man straightened up, slinging her unconscious form over his shoulder, and looked to Zaret. <BR> <BR>Zaret indicated the door, and the four of them walked out of the tavern. Not a single patron rose to stop them, or prevent them from kidnapping the angel. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Midnight slowly came back to the land of the living. Opening his eyes, he found himself looking up at a ceiling, and lying in a bed. He sat up, ignoring the dizziness from the darts, and turned his head, looking around him. <BR> <BR>“Well, your awake. That child that you had with you is gone.” <BR> <BR>Blinking away the last of the darts’ effects at the statement, Midnight bolted upright in the bed. “What?” <BR> <BR>He turned to look in the direction of the voice, seeing only the tavern’s owner, Jericho, looking at him worriedly with his dark brown eyes and brown hair. “I said, that child that you were with is gone. Some of the patrons said the slaver, Zaret, kidnapped her.” <BR> <BR>“<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>!” Midnight spat out, throwing his legs over the side of the bed. He eyed Jericho angrily. “How long was I out? And what happened to Jonah? She was supposed to tell him I sent her…he knows what to do.”  <BR> <BR>Jericho simply shrugged. “You were unconscious for three hours. Jonah is in bed, resting. Yes, he knows what to do, but that cursed Zaret also knows how to prevent people from helping his targets. You know that, Midnight. Jonah did his best. He got a dagger in the chest for his efforts.” <BR> <BR>“Dammit!” Midnight cursed forcefully. “He could be anywhere with her by now.” Without another word, the big hunter stood up, ignoring the woozy leftovers of the darts, and threw his weapons’ belt on, then his armor and cape. He studied Jericho for a moment. “Is Jonah alright?” <BR>Jericho nodded. “Aye. He’s fine. Pissed, but fine. You know Jonah.” The man shrugged, eyeing Midnight calmly. “And where do you think your going?” <BR> <BR>“To find her.” Midnight growled in return, moving to the door. <BR> <BR>“Alone?” <BR> <BR>“I don’t see you offering to help.” <BR> <BR>“I’m offering.” <BR> <BR>“Alright, then. Let’s move. I know a few of the usual places he brings his girls to right after acquisition. I don’t want that child enslaved. She deserves far better than that…and with her looks, and her wings…” Midnight let his sentence trail off, not finishing the unspoken thought that both men knew. Pleasure slave. She was petite, fragile, young, alone, inexperienced, and winged. Those factors, put together, both men knew she’d bring a lot of gold on the slave market. <BR> <BR>Jericho nodded once more, and hefted his broadsword, then checked his crossbow, and various other weapons. Apparently he’d been ready to go for a while. Both men headed downstairs, and out of the tavern, intent upon finding the faery, hopefully before the slaver had sold her. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Zaret ordered his men to halt some miles into the woods, away from the tavern. He waved at the blankets set on the ground, indicating the man carrying the angel should put her down. The man dropped her, none too gently, to the bedrolls, and stepped back, his eyes roaming over the angel’s form hungrily. <BR> <BR>Zaret glared at him, seeing the look. “You’ll get your chance, Nimbus. Don’t worry. Right now, though…she’s mine.” The burly thug that had carried her from the tavern simply nodded, and went off his own way so he didn’t have to watch what happened next. <BR> <BR>Zaret smiled thinly, looking down at the unconscious angel. With a smirk, he tore the clothing off of her, and snapped a collar into place around her neck. Then he tilted his head to the side a little, looking at her. She was indeed tiny. Very small boned, definitely worth a lot on the slave market. He ran a hand through her snow white hair, and caressed her cheek softly, smiling. <BR> <BR>Looking up, he saw the other two men still standing there. With a tight smile he shook his head at the other man, and looked to the smallest one again.  “Well, what are you two idiots standing there for? You’ve got a camp to get set up. Get it set up!” <BR> <BR>The man just shrugged, but shifted his weight uncomfortably on his feet, flushing a little as he looked down at the naked form of the faery.  <BR> <BR>“Yeah, yeah, alright…” He just smirked, and let his eyes roam over the faery again, then back to Zaret’s face before turning on his heel and stalking off into the woods to gather firewood for the night.  <BR> <BR>Zaret grinned, and knelt down next to the faery… <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>She woke up within the hour. <BR> <BR>Enraged, and in pain, Seliah threw up a massive wall of fire separating her from the men in front of her. She immediately ran out of the cave, and spread her wings, taking flight. She didn’t get far. Within minutes, she felt the sting of more darts and tumbled from the air, to land hard on the ground after crashing through the branches of a tree, unconscious again from a concussion, one wing broken. <BR> <BR>Zaret and his men scrambled over her, quickly binding her limbs. Zaret himself slapped a binding on her wings, to prevent another aerial escape. They’d been lucky this time. Next time, she might succeed. There was nothing to be done about her spitting fire, however. They’d have to take their chances with that. <BR> <BR>&#40;&#40;And once again, carrying over the rest over to another post.&#41;&#41;

 Without further ado, the slaver motioned for one of his men to lift the angel from the ground, and they moved off through the forest, back to their camp, the faery unconscious now…as Zaret would keep her from this point on until Orion came to claim her. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Midnight and Jericho stalked through the forest, each in silent fury. Jericho was a good man, Midnight knew…and the two of them had paired up for raiding missions before. They usually made a lethal team. This time was different, though. For some reason, Midnight had taken this personally. <BR>Glancing over at the smaller man, Midnight shook his head and muttered another in a long line of particularly foul Elven curses. Jericho turned his head, his grey eyes taking in the hunter’s big frame, the features that at this moment seemed carved out of solid rock. Black eyes that were inscrutable with a quiet, stony rage. The kind that you don’t know exists until it strikes out at you. <BR> <BR>In a quiet, calm voice, as he always spoke, Jericho said, “You’ve fallen for her, haven’t you, Midnight?” <BR> <BR>“Fallen? I don’t follow you.” <BR> <BR>The wiry, agile, man just smiled with a soft chuckle. “Of course you have. I see it in your eyes. This is personal, to you.” <BR> <BR>“Of course it is!” the Hunter bellowed angrily.  <BR> <BR>“She was under my protection! I failed. Of course it’s personal now!” <BR> <BR>“Midnight…” <BR> <BR>“Ah…shut yer trap, Jericho!” <BR> <BR>With a laugh, Jericho did so, knowing better than to push the hunter too far. Midnight was an honorable man…but he possessed an explosive temper. More than one man had been forced into a healer’s care after angering the hunter. Even friends. Jericho himself had suffered broken bones at the hands of Midnight. <BR> <BR>They walked the rest of the way in silence; Jericho amused, Midnight enraged. Midnight raised one massive hand in a silent call to halt as they neared what looked like a temporary camp set up in the middle of the forest.  <BR> <BR>Nodding, the tavern owner ducked behind some brush, and watched as the hunter did the same. He might own the tavern…but out here was the hunter’s territory, and Midnight was boss when they were hunting. Like they were now. <BR> <BR>From their respective perches behind the brush, they could see four men, and a winged girl, naked, obviously beaten, sitting around the fire. Jericho saw the hunter’s jaw clench, and knew the beaten and battered form to be the child he’d been with earlier in the day.  <BR> <BR>The white-haired faery was bound, hand and foot. Even her wings were pinned together with a metal clasp, and she wore no clothing. An iron collar was around her neck, and a gag in her mouth. They could both see the bruising on her, and the dried blood, and the cuts. Her silver wings were coated in red, especially around the clasp, and her hair was matted with blood, and dirt and leaves. She’d obviously been beaten, and severely. <BR> <BR>At the moment, though…the four men at the fire were eating. Jericho recognized one of them as being Zaret, and saw the man remove her gag, trying to force her to eat. The child, however, clamped her jaw shut, and refused to open it for him, earning herself a viscious backhand across the face, that caused her nose to bleed. <BR> <BR>At Midnight’s start, Jericho just put a hand on the hunter’s arm. “Not now. Not yet. If you want to get her back safely, wait until they’ve bedded down for the night.” He whispered quickly, then moved his hand from the other man’s arm. <BR> <BR>To his relief, Midnight nodded once, his black eyes blazing now with barely contained fury. He intended to get Seliah away from the slavers. But he also intended to kill Zaret. If for no other reason, than for the beatings he’d obviously given the faery. The girl deserved better than slavery…and he was going to see to it that she got it. Or die trying. <BR> <BR>Jericho meanwhile, just watched, and waited for a good opportunity. Darkness fell. Silently, he pulled his heavy crossbow, and loaded it. Then he glanced to Midnight. <BR> <BR>“I know I can take out at least two of them before we go charging in. Make the odds nice and even.” He whispered. <BR> <BR>Midnight smirked, and nodded an affirmative, but didn’t speak. Taking that nod as permission, Jericho leveled the crossbow for one of the thug’s heads. The biggest of the four men. Without hesitation, he fired. <BR> <BR>The bolt smashed into the back of the man’s skull, and both hunters watched as the man’s head literally exploded in a spectacular show of blood and brains shooting out, coating his peers. Then the body itself collapsed forward, into the flames, and erupted. The man never knew what hit him. <BR> <BR>Instantly, Jericho reloaded, and both hunters moved to a different hiding position, as the three remaining slavers would know what direction the shot came from. Even as they settled into the new places, Zaret and the two thugs both jumped up, grabbing their weapons. The slaver motioned for the two thugs to spread out, and find them, and dragged Seliah into the cave behind them. <BR>Jericho pumped off two more shots with the crossbow, taking out one of the thugs, in a similar show as the first one. The remaining thug whirled in the direction of the shot, and whipped a dagger at them, which buzzed right by Jericho’s ear.  <BR> <BR>“To close for comfort, swine…” Jericho muttered, and got off one more shot, the large crossbow slamming the bolt right into the man’s heart. He then slapped the weapon to his back again, and drew his sword, even as Midnight drew his knives and rushed the cave from hiding. <BR> <BR>Jericho came in behind him, just in time to see Midnight grab Zaret by the throat, and hold him up to the cave wall, pinning him there.  <BR> <BR>“The girl. Get the girl!” Midnight snapped, and thrust his knife to the slaver’s throat, drawing a little bit of blood. Zaret simply smiled behind the blade, and raised an arm. A large ball of black flame erupted, and slammed into Midnight’s chest at point blank range, sending the big hunter flying backwards, into the wall across from the slaver. <BR> <BR>Jericho nodded at the words, and ducking Midnight’s airborne form, he reached down and got a hold of the child’s unconscious form. Zaret growled, and charged Jericho, but the smaller hunter already had his broadsword out, and the man impaled himself on the point of the sword. <BR>Midnight, taking advantage of the temporary pause as Zaret attempted to pull himself off of Jericho’s blade, grabbed the gasping slaver once more by the throat, and cursing fiercely, snapped his neck in one, quick motion with a sickening sound of breaking bone. The slaver went limp on Jericho’s blade. <BR> <BR>&#40;&#40;And  carried over again...this chapter seemed to be longer than the first one&#41;&#41;

 Midnight growled a not-so-nice euphamism about Zaret&#39;s parentage, releasing the body from his grip. Then he turned to face Seliah. “Is she even alive, Jericho?” <BR> <BR>Dropping his blade and the body impaled on it to the ground, Jericho nodded. “Yes…though just barely. My own healing abilities are somewhat limited, Midnight…she needs to see a healer. We have to get her back to Jonah. I’ll do what I can for her, though, so she can be well enough to travel.” <BR> <BR>Without another word exchanged, Midnight nodded, and knelt down beside the faery, pulling one of his throwing knives out, to cut her bonds. He looked at the collar on her and growled softly. Nothing he could do about that at the moment.  She was covered with injuries. Stab wounds, cuts, bruises, broken bones…she’d been beaten severely…to within an inch of her life.  <BR> <BR>Jericho worked silently, bandaging what wounds he could, healing what injuries he could. After several hours, he rocked back on his heels, and collapsed into a heap on the ground beside the faery, unconscious from the drain on his mind and body. Midnight pursed his lips into a thin, tight line, and sighed softly.  <BR> <BR>He glanced at Jericho, and recognized the reason for the man’s unconscious state.  The wiry hunter would recover soon enough. Turning back to the faery, Midnight was hard pressed not to explode with rage at her condition. <BR> <BR> <BR>After the sun had risen, Jericho came around slowly. By the time he had fully regained consciousness, the faery was awake as well, and shivering. She blinked, and looked around her, those eyes of hers going from solid black to blazing red then settling on green as she recognized Midnight. Shivering slightly in the early morning chill from lack of clothing, she started to bring her wings around her, then winced, and stopped, when she couldn’t. With a small sigh, she gave it up, and just settled on shivering. <BR> <BR>Midnight’s black eyes softened visibly at the sight of the child’s shivering. Without asking, he simply reached out to her, and gently scooped her up with large hands, holding her close to him as he transferred some of his own body heat to her. The sight the collar, and the clasp on her wings enraged him, but his face didn’t show it one bit. <BR> <BR>“…Midnight? That be ye…?” <BR> <BR>“Yes, M’lady. It is. Relax, your safe.” <BR> <BR>“Th’ slaver…I…I tried tae fight…after he killed th’ tender…but…” her soft voice trailed off, her cheeks turning a bright red with anger. <BR> <BR>“Shh. Relax, Seliah. He won’t hurt you again. You have my word on it.” <BR> <BR>“Nae…he be alive, Midnight…he…hit me wi’ two o’ those darts o’ his…I…I tried tae fight…couldn’t fight…tried to run…he caught me…bound m’wings so I couldna escape again…he…he…they…” <BR> <BR>Midnight sighs softly, and once more examines her injuries, noticing a few bite marks here and there, but again…nothing convincing. He sighed once more, and looked back into her eyes, seeing the green. She wasn’t making any sense, more rambling than anything else. <BR> <BR>“M’lady…what are you trying to tell me? Slow down, and try again. Your safe. Your with me and a friend.” <BR> <BR>“I…he…they…” she sighed once, and closed her eyes, cheeks burning red with anger. Very softly, she whispered it to him.  <BR>“They…I couldna fight, Midnight…I tried…too little…” her words trailed off again, as her eyes rolled up and she went limp in his arms. <BR> <BR>When Jericho turned to look at the two,  Midnight’s face was stone cold in fury. The hunter stood up, holding the faery protectively, and wrapped his cape over her to afford her some modesty, then looked to Jericho. “Let’s move.” <BR> <BR>Jericho nodded and headed for the opening of the cave. As they moved out, he took note of where things were, and confiscated a few weapons as well, some knives, a sword or two here and there. <BR> <BR>In total silence, they made their way back to Jericho’s Inn, and marched right through the door, Midnight having dropped his cape over top of the faery so as to afford the child some modesty as they stalked through the Inn, and straight upstairs, to the third floor. <BR> <BR>&#40;&#40;Carried over again...hopefully last post.&#41;&#41;

 Jericho grabbed Jonah, who was now healed and tending bar again, and the two men followed Midnight upstairs grimly. Jonah and Jericho moved into Midnight’s room in time to see the massive man lay the child down on his bed with a gentleness that belied his size. <BR> <BR>“Son of a—!“ Jonah muttered as Midnight removed the cape from the girl’s top. “Let me at her. Now!” <BR>The hunter nodded once, and moved out of the healer/bartender’s way, watching him closely. The man stood next to the bed, and gingerly ran his hands over the faery, checking for internal injuries, finding numerous ones, numerous broken bones. He turned the child over onto her side to examine her back, and shook his head as more injuries were revealed in the action. <BR> <BR>Setting her down on her back again, Jonah grabbed a stool that sat nearby, shoving the items on it to the floor and taking a seat as he muttered an ongoing monologue, cataloguing each and every injury, mark, cut, scrape, or bruise on her. <BR> <BR>His hands glowing a light green as he started chanting, he laid them on the child, the glow encompassing both Seliah and Jonah, enveloping them in a bright white light, staying that way for nearly an hour’s time. By the time Jonah removed his hands, the healer-tender was extremely pale, and drawn.  <BR> <BR>“Jonah?” Jericho stood up, ready to catch the other man if he should lose consciousness.  <BR> <BR>“I’m…alright, Jericho. Just worn out, and drained. The girl will live…” he said quietly, his speech slurring. Looking at the faery, he sighed softly, and turned back to face Midnight. “She will live…I could not heal all of her injuries, but she will survive. The kind of beating she took…by all rights…she should be dead.” <BR> <BR>“Dead? What happened to her?” Midnight demanded. <BR> <BR>Jonah just shook his head. “Broken ribs, broken arm, busted leg, internal bleeding, hemorrhaging…at least ten or twelve stab wounds, she had hot irons placed on her at some point, took a severe whipping…” he trailed his words off, suddenly gripping the side of the bed with shaking hands, and closed his eyes a moment. <BR> <BR>“And? What else?” the hunter demanded again, distinctly sensing an “and” in that statement somewhere… <BR> <BR>Jonah just sighs. “…and…” he trailed off, then snapped irritably, “Midnight., what the hell do you think happened? You been dealing with Zaret’s ilk long enough. I don’t need to tell you.” <BR> <BR>Midnight’s jaw clenched tightly shut, as Jonah pushed off from the girl’s bed and turned to face the two hunters. He took a single step, pale beyond measure, and then his eyes rolled up into the back of his head as he collapsed to the floor. <BR> <BR>Jericho quickly caught the healer, and dragged him over to the other bed in the room, lying him down on that.  <BR> <BR>Looking to Midnight, he just shook his head. “There’s no use getting angry. Every one of them is dead. We killed them. She will survive, and you kept her from going into slavery. You did what you vowed to yourself you would.” <BR> <BR>“N’uum amin.” ::No, I didn’t:: Midnight snapped in Elven, black eyes watching the faery’s sleeping form. <BR> <BR>“Uma lle uum, Midnight.” ::Yes, you did, Midnight:: Jericho replied in kind. The hunter’s eyes widened slightly at the owner’s use of the Elven words, and Jericho grinned. “Come now, my friend. Do you not think that after five years of listening to you rant and rave, and curse in Elven, I would not have learned a little of it?” <BR> <BR>Midnight chuckled, and shook his head, a rueful grin on his face. “Aye…I suppose you would’ve, Jericho.” He turned back to the faery, his dark eyes still worried as he watched her. <BR> <BR>“Re’na jentui.” ::She’ll be fine.:: Jericho says simply, with a smile, and takes one more look at the healer, and shrugs. “Well…seeing how my tender is out of commission for the moment, I have a bar to tend to.” <BR> <BR>“Aye…you do that.” Midnight replied with a grin, and sat down on the end of the girl’s bed, just watching her silently.  <BR> <BR>Jericho started for the hallway, but paused in the doorframe to turn back and look at the hunter. “Oh, and Midnight…?” <BR> <BR>“Aye, Jericho?” Midnight replied, amusedly, a smirk on his face. <BR> <BR>“Next time you go hunting, we bring in backup, alright?” <BR> <BR>Midnight laughed softly, then nodded. “Aye…next time we go, we’ll have backup.” He replied with another grin and no intention of doing so. <BR> <BR>“Good.” The Inn’s owner chuckled once, lightly, and left the room. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;	&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Seliah woke up three days after the healer’s attentions. Opening her eyes, the first thing she saw was the massive form of Midnight, bulky as ever, and still, sitting at her bedside. The next thing she noticed was that she was in a room, clothed, and in a bed, her collar still in place, however. The third thing she noticed was that it was  quiet, with no one but them in the room, and the door was closed. <BR> <BR>“Midnight?” <BR> <BR>“Aye, M’lady. Your safe, no need to worry. Back in the Inn.” <BR> <BR>“I…” <BR> <BR>“Shh.” Midnight opened his bottomless black eyes to look down on the small form of the faery-human, and sighed softly. She’d more or less healed at this point, all that was left of the brutal treatment by Zaret and his men were a few bruises and that particularly nasty knife wound that went from temple to jawbone down her face. <BR> <BR>Seliah sits up, though, and looks at him. “I’m thirsty.” <BR> <BR>Midnight nods, and stands. “Then stay where you are. I’ll be right back with something for you to drink.” <BR> <BR>She started to protest, but the look on Midnights face stopped her and she remained seated in the bed. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;	&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;		&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Some months later, however, things would go wrong yet again. Seliah having more or less taken up an unofficial position in Jericho’s Inn as a bartender and cook, she had even received wages from the owner. Nothing official, just that Jericho made it a point to pay her as well when he did Jonah and his other employees. <BR> <BR>There was a dark night, one of those thunder and lightening storms that cause one’s hair to stand on end. Midnight and Jericho were out hunting again. Seliah by now had been well-versed in what to do if Midnight or Jericho sent someone to them, and had helped prevent at least twenty girls, and young boys from being enslaved. <BR> <BR>The door to the tavern opened, and Seliah, who at the time was cleaning off the bar top, looked up, seeing a man and two girls, obviously slaves, enter. Clenching her jaw, she forced her tone to a polite neutral as she asked the huge man what she could do for him. <BR> <BR>The man, about seven feet tall, and almost four hundred pounds simply smiled. “I’d like an ale, and two waters for my pets, please.” <BR> <BR>Seliah looked the man over, from his meticulously groomed hair, to the finely adorned red cloak, with various emblems and symbols sewn onto it. Definitely a mage of some sort…she’d have to be careful around this one. She glanced at the two slaves. Both wearing a simple slave’s dress, and both also in collars with chains attached, that the man was using to guide them. They glanced up with their eyes only, then averted their gaze again before their master saw the movement. <BR> <BR>Strengthening her mental barriers for all they were worth, she handed the mage his ale and waters. “Thank you, child.” The mage said, automatically referring to her as he would his own slaves. Seliah gritted her teeth, the importance of the comment not lost on her, but avoided making a comment. This was not someone she wanted to take on with Midnight and Jericho off hunting, and Jonah upstairs sleeping. <BR> <BR>“O’ course, M’lord.” She says quietly instead, and goes back to cleaning the bar top off. The Inn was quiet, only a few nightowls, or insomniacs up and downstairs drinking or reading at the tables and hearth. <BR> <BR>The mage smiled charmingly, his voice a smooth baritone, and moves to a table, leading the two slaves by the collar. He sits down, and gives Seliah another long look, his eyes lighting on her wings, then sets about drinking his ale, keeping a watchful eye on the girl without letting on that he was. <BR> <BR>At the end of her shift, just after Jonah came down to relieve her, the mage made his move. He’d been eyeing her all night long. As Seliah moved from behind the bar and headed towards the stairs, he spoke a few words and the next thing the faery knew she was bound in some sort of vine that had suddenly sprouted from the floor. <BR> <BR>Instantly struggling, she tried her Fires; no use. The vines were resistant. The mage approached her silently, smiling. She hissed, and sang softly, barely able to get her hands in the proper position for the fireball. She sent a large fireball at the mage, but it dissipated prematurely. Then she couldn’t cast anymore after that. He’d nullified her Fires somehow.  <BR> <BR>Jonah stopped dead at the bar as he heard Seliah singing. He looked over, and quickly hopped the bar, placing a hand on the mage’s arm. “I’d strongly suggest you leave her alone, and go elsewhere for the day, sir.” <BR> <BR>The mage turned to face Jonah, and a small smile spread across his face. “No thank you. I am Nova and I have come to claim what is rightfully the property of my brother, Orion…and he gets what he pays for. You see…he paid for this girl some months back, when his buyer turned up dead under suspicious circumstances. Orion does not pay for nothing.” <BR> <BR>Without further ado, the mage, and his two slaves closed the distance between Seliah’s bound form, and then disappeared in a puff of black smoke before Jonah could do more than unsheathe his blade.
