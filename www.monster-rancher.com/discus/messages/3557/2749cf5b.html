<FONT COLOR="ff0000">I don&#39;t know how to indent paragraphs. So I&#39;ll use black and blue to show where there is a change of paragraphs. I hope that this will make my story more readable. I&#39;ll also use other colors in a manner to show that there is a different person speaking.</FONT> <BR> <BR> Fog has been sitting thick and heavy since morning. Only the heavy footsteps of the tyrant in the distance gave asign of life in the forest town of Hollow Oaks. Life? As it&#39;s form broke though the swirling mists, one could see by it&#39;s dull eyes and discolored scales, that it is no longer among the living. It was now being followed by sounds of the covered wagon that it is pulling. Holding the reins, the draco doll sitting alone at the front of the wagon was darting it&#39;s gaze in all directions. Giggling maniacally, it was overjoyed that it&#39;s task of driving the wagon would soon be over. Even though it&#39;s master expects the little fiend to guard the wagon while he&#39;s engaged in other matters, the doll had already picked out a concealed spot in the wagon that&#39;ll be perfect for napping.<FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">It&#39;s been two months since the spring tournement was held at the arena. The only yearly event that fills the streets in this dwindling town of around 200 living souls. Other than the too few fishermen and monster ranchers, the real economic mainstay are the pirates who make this their home port. Right now, they&#39;re out to sea. Plundering foreign merchant ships and poaching monsters from other continents.</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR>The wagon ended it&#39;s trek in front of a large building that reeks of old blood and rotten entrails. Over the door, a wooden plaque hangs from a beam jutting out from the wall. On it is a painted releif of a butcher knife set across a stretched hide.<FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">The doll pulled hard on the reins, set the brake, and went into the wagon.</FONT><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#34;Master! Master! We&#39;re here, we&#39;re here. That&#39;s right, that&#39;s right.&#34;</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR>Out from a bed roll of dodongo hide and a furred wall zombie, a shaggy grizzled head stirred. The unkempt necromancer opened one eye to the sight of the draco doll standing on the corner of the cage, looking down at him. There was a time that the old man thought that Hot Foot&#39;s incessant head shaking and repititious &#34;That&#39;s right, that&#39;s right.&#34;, was cute. Now it&#39;s just irritating. <FONT COLOR="119911">&#34;That&#39;s right, that&#39;s right.&#34;</FONT>, he bitterly mocked. The stupid little beast was happy, thinking that it&#39;s master graciously spoke to it on the same level.<FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Climbing down out of the wagon, the necromancer was greeted by a huge woman, wearing a canvas apron stained by the great deal of blood that she had shed in her craft.</FONT><FONT COLOR="aabb00">&#34;Good day Carl.&#34;</FONT><FONT COLOR="0000ff">,she beamed.</FONT><FONT COLOR="aabb00">&#34;What have you brought me?&#34;</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR>The old man returned the smile, then turn to remove the blanket that had covered the cage. Inside, a sleepy mocchi sat up and asked,<FONT COLOR="ff6000">&#34;Training?&#34;</FONT>. The pink ball of fat widened it&#39;s eyes in horror, as it&#39;s master and the butcher broke out in hysterical laughter. The sudden realization of it&#39;s fate quickly led to a flood of tears, screaming, and begging.<FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">This prompted Hot Foot to tease the doomed mocchi.</FONT><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#34;Space Waste dead meat, Space Waste dead meat. That&#39;s right, that&#39;s r..guhhh..&#34;</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR>The dolls words were cut short, by the old man grabbing it by the throat, and being handed over to the woman.<FONT COLOR="119911">&#34;Pose this one as a bookend. But skin the mocchi.&#34;</FONT>, he managed to speak out between laughs. If it weren&#39;t for the anti-magic rings that the humans are wearing, Hot Foot might have considered putting up a fight. But, all it could do was cry.<FONT COLOR="ffffff">.............</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">After taking care of that business, still laughing about the suprised looks on his monsters&#39; faces, he strolled over to the Silky Claw for lunch. Wanting to place his order as soon as he sits down, he considered the usual fare.</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR><B>Appetizers ;</B> <FONT COLOR="0000ff">Sweet and Sour Mocchi, or the Blue and Gold Salad?</FONT> <B>Main Course;</B> <FONT COLOR="0000ff">Corone Casserole, Prince Hare Stew, Skewered Skipper, or Salamander Roast glazed with Jelly Hound?</FONT> And <B>Dessert;</B> <FONT COLOR="0000ff">Ice Candy, or Icy Jell wrapped in Manna?</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.............</FONT> <BR> <BR>Closing the heavy door behind him, Carl headed towards his favorite booth. Although there&#39;s no other customers here, the added seclusion and privacy increased his comfort. A very young kitten that he&#39;d never seen before, came up to take his order.<FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff6000">&#34;Purrr. Good afternoon sir. Would you like something to drink?&#34;</FONT> <FONT COLOR="0000ff">Her face scrunched up in concentration as she began to recite,</FONT><FONT COLOR="ff6000">&#34;We have: A jack of Giga Pint; calms your nerves, but too much will put you to sleep. Purrr. Red Eye Sake; creates a unique tingly sensation first in the mouth, then the rest of the body. Energizing, but not too strong. Purrr. Silky Sweet Stout, the tavern&#39;s specialty. Good body, great head. The sweet creamy aftertaste is from adding kitten milk in..purrr.. the final stage of the fermentation process. Purrr.&#34;</FONT> <FONT COLOR="0000ff">The kitten&#39;s entire face and body change from tense to completely relaxed. This amused the old man. So,he asked her to repeat the choices again. Several times.</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR> Having had his fun, he became curious.<FONT COLOR="119911">&#34;So, what happened to that saucy little pixie, Hot Lips? Does she still serve drinks?&#34;</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff"> In wide -eyed response, she purred,</FONT><FONT COLOR="ff6000">&#34;I don&#39;t know. Purrr. I&#39;m new here.&#34;</FONT><FONT COLOR="0000ff"> After a moment of silence between them, she offered,</FONT><FONT COLOR="ff6000">&#34;Would you like to know today&#39;s specials?&#34;</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">&#34;Sure&#34;</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT><FONT COLOR="ff6000">&#34;We have Daina Tacos.

Purrr.&#34;</FONT><FONT COLOR="ffffff">.....</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#34;FLUFFY!&#34;</FONT>came the angry roar from the kitchen door. The wave of rage that came from the ivory skinned red head, sent the terrified pixie cringing onto the floor. The infuriated tavern owner stormed over, picked up Fluffy by the throat, and growled<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#34;I&#39;ve got another recipe to try!&#34;</FONT> Just then, from the strain of picking up and holding the pixie, the woman let a very loud one rip.<FONT COLOR="ffffff">........</FONT> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">The old man began laughing so hard that tears began streaming out of his eyes.

 an interesting and different take on the monster rancher cast of characters.  not for weak stomachs&#91;!&#93;   <BR> <BR>hit enter twice when posting, then you dont have to worry about indenting - it will at least be a distinct block of text.  and when using different colors, yellow just doesnt work - virtually unreadable.

 Yay!  <BR> <BR>Torey. You give a monster a fish, you feed it for a month. You teach a monster how to fish, you feed it for life. Thanks for teaching this old dog a new trick. <BR> <BR>Lisa. You&#39;ve made me very happy. I was so bummed out at how I posted my story &#40;especially the near unreadable yellow&#41;. When I returned to this page, and begun to see how you&#39;ve organized it, I started cheering! I even told my family about it before I checked at the bottom to see if there was a response. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. <BR> <BR>Black Razor. Darkness knows darkness. Now that I&#39;m totally psyched, there will be more of the necromancer to come.

 Oh yeah. I was so excited, that I forgot to ask. <BR> <BR> Lisa? What are the chances of having an art page?

 Well, an art page kind of scares me in terms of costs. If a size limit could be agreed upon, it might be possible.  <BR> <BR>The other option would be to find some free webspace &#40;there&#39;s a chance that the currently unused message space in the Delphi area we use as alternate chat would be a possibility&#41; which I could link to. This software does allow for opening other sites within the right-hand frame. &#40;That&#39;s what happens when you enter the chatrooms.&#41; My only concern with free webspace is that it might &#34;expire&#34; the posts, deleting the pictures after a while. <BR> <BR>The other option is to just have a series of posts linking to individual&#39;s art sites. &#40;Check out the formatting section on links.&#41; I personally use AuctionWatch.com for image hosting. It&#39;s supposed to be a tool for online auctions, but I put all sorts of photos there. &#40;They expire all pictures 90 days after the last viewing, so if a picture keeps getting hits, it stays.&#41;
