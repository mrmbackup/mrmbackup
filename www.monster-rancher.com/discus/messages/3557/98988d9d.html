 Again I was thanking the various stars that shone over my life.  The trek in the jungle was hard, vines and creepers as well as insects and the odd heavy rain impeded our travel.  If it were not for Durahan&#39;s great sword and nearly tireless strength, we would have had a much rougher time of things. <BR> <BR>Over the next month or so, the jungle gave way to less tropical forests.  The weather had also started to change as well.  The nights were getting cooler, the humid jungle were now forests covered in almost unnatural fog.  The once warm and intense rains were shorter, cooler showers. <BR> <BR>The change was welcome at first.  Sarah, Angel and even Durahan seemed tired of the endless humid jungle with nothing but tripping roots and incessantly buzzing insects.  I too was tired of the jungle, breaking the monotony of it by trying to look for things to hunt.  A few times I was successful in bringing down a small rabbit or two, after Durahan had startled them with his tireless trailblazing.  One of these rabbits became a new pair of shoes for Angel, who had worn hers out with all the walking.  She wouldn&#39;t eat meat, but she seemed to like fur.  And it cheered her up a little as well.  With my almost fanatical determination, Angel was looking at me with more and more of those depressed looks. <BR> <BR>We knew though, that we couldn&#39;t keep this pace without finding a place to gather supplies again.  Every night we huddled closer together in the big tent, and warmer clothes would soon be needed as well.  So we kept watch for anything that resembled a trail.  On the third day of looking for one, Sarah literally stumbled over it.  It was a hunting trail, noticeable only due to the slight indent into the ground, and after looking around, a couple of small stone markers too. <BR> <BR>I used the limited tracking skills I had been taught, and managed, on my first try, to get us pointed in the right direction.  It was still another day&#39;s walk, but we were all looking forward to the rest, as well as clothes more suited to the climate. <BR> <BR>Several surprises awaited us when we got there.  The first came in the form of a weathered man in his middle years, carrying a bow and arrow and dressed in forest greens for camouflage.  The surprise, was when I had an arrow bury itself at my feet. <BR> <BR>After some hasty calming of Durahan, and explaining ourselves, the man emerged and explained the sudden hostility.  Apparently, there was a very strong monster roaming around.  Several hunters had been wounded or killed already, and the local game was scarce as well.  We told him all we needed was supplies for a trip north, and he agreed to lead us back to the village. <BR> <BR>The next surprise was from the village itself.  It looked like it was only a couple steps from becoming deserted.  &#39;Because of the monster&#39; was the hunter&#39;s reply when I asked.  It was too cold to grow food, and the monster was scaring or killing the local game, and hurting the hunters when it had the chance.  If any help was to be had here, the four of us knew it would be after we helped them first. <BR> <BR>More delays, I thought.  But that was at first.  My righteous fury towards my father&#39;s betrayer faded as my father&#39;s words echoed from the back of my mind.  &#39;You don&#39;t need a reason to be helpful.&#39;  These people needed help, badly, and I saw no monsters here, aside from Durahan and Angel. <BR> <BR>The third surprise, was that at first, we were refused on our offer to help.  The small band of hunters that were still fit to actually hunt gave us one good look, and laughed in our faces. &#39;Too young&#39; or &#39;with a monster like that?&#39;  Were the first comments.  Durahan answered my thoughts by proving his strength to them.  With a simple flick of his wrist, his great sword sheared the top off a boulder, without separating the two pieces.  The hunter who had greeted us, looked at the boulder carefully, and then slid the top piece off. <BR> <BR>A few grudging compliments later, and we had a deal.  We would get the supplies we needed, if we brought down the monster that was tormenting the village.  The next step, was, what exactly where we hunting? <BR> <BR>That was our next surprise.  We went to the small shack that held the wounded hunters.  Two of the three that were there, managed to get away while their partner was killed.  The third, apparently, had been found after getting beaten by the monster.  He was in the worst shape by far. <BR> <BR>Sarah and I were surprised he was still alive.  It looked like he was crushed by a couple of trees.  Broken arms broken, one leg as well.  Ribs bound, one eye and his entire head bandaged.  His breathing was labored and he seemed to be suffering from a fever.  He kept mumbling too, &#39;pink monster&#39; were his words. <BR> <BR>The first hunter, who was in the best of shape, agreed with him.  It was a large pink monster.  &#39;Never seen anything like it&#39;, he said, &#39;crashed out of the trees, took hold of my partner, and dragged him back into the forest.&#39; <BR> <BR>Large pink monster?  I&#39;d never seen anything like that before.  But that wouldn&#39;t stop us. <BR> <BR>&#39;So Miki, what are we going to do?&#39;  Sarah asked me that night, after we were given a cabin for the night. <BR> <BR>Durahan looked up from his spot on the floor, in front of the door, and I answered, &#39;What else can we do?  We need supplies, they need help.  Fair trade, right?&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;But...  What if Durahan can&#39;t handle this monster?  He is not even a year old yet, and has no real combat experience.&#39;  Sarah replied. <BR> <BR>&#39;I know.  But he will have me, and that hunter as backup.  This isn&#39;t an arena, we don&#39;t have to make this an even match.&#39;  I looked back to Durahan to cut off his protest, &#39;Sarah is right.  You are still young.  You have great strength, but that might not be enough.&#39; <BR> <BR>Durahan caught the undertone I gave him.  You can&#39;t help people if you are dead.  I knew he didn&#39;t like the idea of being unfair in combat, but we had few other options.  Angel also looked worried.  She however, made no comments, the little pad of paper in front of her remained blank, her hands fidgeting with the pencil. <BR> <BR>I gave her a worried look myself, as did Sarah, but I shook my head and yawned.  &#39;We will be no good if we are half asleep tomorrow.  Lets turn in.&#39;  We all nodded and made ready for bed. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>I pause my writing, and look out the window.  &#39;Almost dawn...&#39;  I say quietly, getting a whisper quiet noise from Zan.  I glance over to him, and wave a hand at him to settle down.  &#39;I&#39;ve been writing for hours...  And my eyes are heavy.&#39;  Zan nodded, then resumed his &#39;sleep&#39;. <BR> <BR>I look through my pack by the small desk I am writing on, and come up with a small square of something.  It&#39;s a root that Sarah discovered recently.  After tasting a little of it, and finding it edible and tasty as well, we took some with us.  I did notice, that after she had some, she had become very hyper.  She denied it of coarse, but I asked her not to put too much into the tea that night. <BR> <BR>I take the small cube of the chewy brown root, and pop it into my mouth. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>The next morning we left the village in search of the &#39;pink monster.&#39;  Geoff, the hunter who first greeted us, guided us to the last spot where the monster had attacked.  Sarah and Angel also came with us, despite the warnings of Geoff and myself. <BR> <BR>It wasn&#39;t very hard to miss...  The site where the worst wounded man had been attacked looked more like a small tornado had come and gone, than a monster attack.  It had happened near the edge of the forest, just past the tree line.  Several trees were splintered stumps, or uprooted completely.  Bits of cloth were laying about too, remnants of the wounded man&#39;s partner, no doubt.  Only one monster came to mind when I saw this kind of damage. <BR> <BR>&#39;This is defiantly a golem type monster.  Nothing else fits the way the trees were just...  Broken like this.&#39; I had commented, examining what looked like a knuckle print of a huge fist, made into the dirt. <BR> <BR>Geoff nodded, &#39;Aye.  A dragon would use fire, instead of tossing things around.  Nothing else comes close, does it?&#39;  He sounded worried, and I didn&#39;t blame him.  I&#39;d seen golem type monsters go berserk before.  One of my father&#39;s monsters was killed by one. <BR> <BR>&#39;Some thing that big must have left tracks...  Right?&#39;  Sarah asked, sticking close to Durahan and Angel. <BR> <BR>Geoff and I exchanged looks, and we both nodded.  &#39;Lets look for them.&#39; <BR> <BR>It didn&#39;t take us long to find the tracks, and follow them.  Something bothered me though, and Geoff too.  To hunters like Geoff and myself, the tracks were fairly easy to spot.  Had neither of us been experienced however, we would have lost the trail several times.  A crude yet serviceable attempt had been made by the monster to cover its tracks and leave false trails.  Some times we would actually lose the footprints, but other signs would give it away.  A broken branch, or the odd drop of blood from what we assumed was the dead hunter, lead us back to the footprints.  Eventually, as the day wore on, and the partially obscured sun started to set, we found the end of the trail.  A small cave, the opening forcibly made large enough for something golem sized. <BR> <BR>We paused outside the cave, and looked at each other.  Using hand signals, Geoff organized us quickly.  Sarah and Angel stayed back in the tree line around the cave.  Durahan took point, while Geoff and I stood ready with our bows on either side of Durahan&#39;s rear flanks. <BR> <BR>Geoff lit a torch, took careful aim, making sure the flaming brand was lit well, and tossed it into the mouth of the cave.  Durahan made loud &#39;HM!&#39; Noises, while banging the pommel of his great sword against a rock.  With all the noise and the fire we had tossed into the cave, we were bound to draw the monster out. <BR> <BR>And we did.  With a loud bellowing roar to answer Durahan&#39;s challenge, the monster walked out of the cave.  With big heavy foot steps that rattled the very ground, it stepped into the light.  Durahan, Sarah, Angel and myself then got the last surprise of our stay in the village. <BR> <BR>It was a &#39;Dean&#39;.  Golem and Pixie cross.  Big boulder like skin, but with softer edges and the odd ruff of pink fur on it&#39;s body.  Usually more nimble than the average golem, they were also gentle monsters for the most part. <BR> <BR>But that wasn&#39;t our surprise.  The description clicked into place in my mind once I put the clues together.  Pink monster that had uprooted trees.  No, that wasn&#39;t the surprise.  It was the face of the &#39;Dean&#39;. <BR> <BR>It was human. <BR> <BR> <BR>------------------------ <BR> <BR>Okay.  Many many many many appologies for the delay.  Real life stepped in and dropped a huge blessing onto my perverbial lap.  I met a wonderful lady and I&#39;ve once again lost my single status, after almost 2 1/2 years. <BR> <BR>BUT, don&#39;t worry.  I&#39;ve not forgotten you.  Just had to find time to write.  =^_^=

 Great stuff Daeore. I like how well you portray the monsters emotions and such without verbal speech. Very nice.

 Well, I sorta took it on a &#39;by the game not the show&#39; thing.  I mean...  The monsters in the MR games make various happy/sad/angry/etc grunts chirps grumbles and gestures.  I figured I&#39;d do the same. <BR> <BR>Anyhow...  Next chapter may be delayed a little...  My girlfriend is sick, so is her mom, and I might end up sick too, SO, well, not all smiles over here.
