 Launching himself determinedly, Kuin flew towards the battling monsters screaming &#34;Do not harm anyone!&#34; The leading Naga turned to observe this nuisance, he slithered back to evade Kuin&#39;s strike he belly punched Kuin, he doubled over in pain from the blow, recovering swiftly Kuin spun in a grand arc, slashing at the Naga he saw an odd marking on the Nagas cheek, pondering on this he did not realise his attack had such a powerful effect on the Naga, its blood was pouring out of the wound Kuin inflicted, the Naga let out an eerie wail the Naga&#39;s immediately turned toward their leader, being held in a trance-like state, they slithered hypnotisingly toward the band leader seeing a threat to their leader they hissed angrily at Kuin, anticipating something big, Kuin watched the Nagas warily when Vauna screamed in terror and launched a giga flame at the Nagas burning three to a crisp following this example the companions attacked the rest of the Nagas and Kuin turned back to the Naga band leader he smiled menacingly and the Naga backed away a second and Kuin stabbed at the Naga piercing it directly in the heart, pulling his sword from the lifeless body, Kuin turned to tell the companions they could hide out at their owners ranch, where they could rest and plan their next move. After telling them this Kuin looked around wearily seeing no potential enemies, Kuin and the companions streaked to the road leading out of the town, they sprinted down the road, passing farms and windmills they finally reached Kuin&#39;s home. he was worried as to whether his friends would react badly to the other monsters in his ranch he finally came to the decision, he would tell them about his housemates. <BR> <BR> <BR>They didnt react as badly as he thought they would to him having a beaclon and a dragon as a housemates Juan, having digested the Galis, suggested bringing them along they would be an asset to their attack force Kuin reluctantly agreed well knowing that Juan might not like them after seeing their eating manners, but they reacted O.K at seeing a dragon and a beaclon scoffing into a tub full of trout, at least on the outside they didnt react Vauna thought oh my god how could Kuin put up with this Juan thought oh not too bad though id prefer better Trana thought what is with these monsters? Lirna thought remind me never to set foot in a big stable like this again.
