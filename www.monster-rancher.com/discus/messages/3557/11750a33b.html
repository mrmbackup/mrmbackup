 Alright, I&#39;m sorry for the delay in my epics, but I&#39;ve had a lot of homework and chores. I just finished this chap, and hope to get chap 4 of Open Wounds up soon, though I can&#39;t make any gaurantees. Oh well, here it comes! <BR> <BR>The MDA Chap 7: Infiltration <BR> <BR>The wind roared as Kala glided atop the clouds. She had seen the Joker, but did not wish to approach too quickly. Her vision was slightly blurred as the wisps of cloud splashed her face gently. She climbed, and then was flying in clear skies under the harvest moon. She looked up at the stars and took a moment to truly capture their beauty. Then, remembering her colleague’s plight, dashed back into the fluffy nimbus cloud. She appeared atop the canopy right behind the Jokers. One doubled back to greet her. <BR> <BR>“About time you showed up,” the Joker spoke in a heavy British accent, “We were wondering if you’d show at all. But, I guess you’d come to save your friend.” <BR> <BR>He extended a hand, “My name is Sirus, what’s yours?” <BR> <BR>“I am Kala,” the Allure extended her dark purple hand and shook the Joker’s black hand. <BR> <BR>With that, Kala increased her speed. There were five other Jokers besides Sirus. The four right in front of Sirus were Kale, Balish, Cuma, and Sprite. They were all very polite. However, the one in front kept silent. There was something different about him. She moved back to Sirus and asked him. <BR> <BR>“Who is the one in front?” she whispered. <BR> <BR>“That’s Diablo, the leader of the Elite Con Carne. Sear, the Joker who was killed, was third in command of us. Sear was a good friend of his, and he willingly took this infiltration mission. He’d also like to meet the Metal Jell, who tried to avenge Sear’s death,” Sirus responded. <BR> <BR>The castle was getting ominously closer now. The old Japanese palace had a large outer wall made of bamboo. Diablo immediately shot into the forest next to the outer wall. The Jokers and Allure quickly ducked in with him.  <BR> <BR>“Why did we stop, Diablo?” asked Cuma, the second in command now that Sear was gone.  <BR> <BR>“Look up there,” Diablo responded in a voice very deep for that of a Joker’s. He was very intimidating, and Kala made it a point to stay away from him.  <BR> <BR>Right where the Joker pointed, there was a lone ninja in a watchtower. <BR> <BR>“Allure, what is your name?” Diablo asked. <BR> <BR>“My name,” the Allure responded, “Is Kala.” <BR> <BR>“I’ve read the reports on you. Supposedly you are practically invisible at night. Is this true?” <BR> <BR>“Yes, I’ve caught many criminals off-guard at night,” Kala was afraid of Diablo. He was much more serious than the other Jokers. <BR> <BR>“Well then,” Diablo sounded amused, “Convince me.” <BR> <BR>“Of what?” <BR> <BR>“That you can really fly untraced throughout the sky. The ninja up there is the only thing stopping us from marching right in. If you can fly up there and kill him before he rings the alarm, we’re in,” Diablo sounded serious again. <BR> <BR>With that, Kala backed up, hopped into the canopy of the forest, spread her purple wings, and took flight. As soon as she had gained altitude, Kala darted into a nimbus cloud, and swiftly made her way silently towards the lone ninja. She crept onto the stalks that held up the small tower, and quietly approached the ninja.  <BR> <BR>The ninja was humming an odd tune, obviously bored. Kala crept up behind him. She whipped up her sharp claws in a single motion and slit the ninja’s throat. She held his mouth so he wouldn’t cry out, and she didn’t let go until the stream of blood pouring from the wound ceased. She waved for Diablo, and he motioned for her to enter the base. <BR> <BR>She was in… <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>Keemo followed Writhe through the halls of the Black Hand’s cavern. Keemo didn’t understand what was happening when that strange when the Darkcell slipped into the room and whispered something into Writhe’s ear. He immediately stood up, and asked Keemo to follow him. The Raiden finally stopped Writhe and questioned him. <BR> <BR>“What’s going on here, why are we suddenly leaving?” <BR> <BR>“Well,” he said, “You’re friend Jango has been captured.” <BR> <BR>Keemo froze and pondered this statement. Jango was captured? How? Why? Who would want to capture Jango? Either way, Keemo was determined to save his friend no matter what. <BR> <BR>“Let’s go,” Keemo whispered, too enraged to call upon his vocal chords for assistance. <BR> <BR>Keemo and Writhe stepped inside a wagon, and a pair of Dragon strapped onto it and heaved it up into the atmosphere. <BR> <BR>“How much longer is it until we arrive at our destination?” Keemo asked Writhe, anxious to save his friend. <BR> <BR>“About ten minutes,” replied Writhe, “Your friend is being held at the base of the Kawrea volcano. There we will find the assailants.” <BR> <BR>“Have you any word of who the perpetrators are?”  <BR> <BR>“I have my intelligence reports, and I hate to say it, but there’s a rumor going around that the Sasuke Army is back in business,” the Beerock said. <BR> <BR>Keemo froze. The Sasuke Army? But he had put them away years ago. How could they be back?  <BR> <BR>As Writhe took a right turn around a stalagmite, he and Keemo reached a slab in the cave. Using his super strength, Writhe pulled the door open with a loud creek. He walked into the moonlight, spread his large wings. <BR> <BR>“Get on,” he gestured to Keemo. <BR> <BR>Keemo placed himself atop the rough skin of various minerals, braced himself. <BR> <BR>“Hold on tight, and don’t let go!” yelled Writhe over the loud humming of his huge wings. With that announcement, Writhe ran a few steps, jumped up into a large palm tree, and managed to break off a few coconuts as he soared into the night air. <BR> <BR>Keemo looked back, and noticed a squad of Lilim, Joker, and Niezheg following them. <BR> <BR>“Why are all those monsters coming with us?” asked Keemo. <BR> <BR>“Do you think me mad?!” replied Writhe, “I’m not going to march against an entire army all by myself. That’s suicide!” <BR> <BR>With that, Writhe, Keemo, and the various monsters took to the air and soon came into view of the Kawrea volcano. <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>Kala passed various armors and weapons of Japanese origin as she silently passed through the halls of the Sasuke Army’s grand temple. As she waked through the torch lit hallways, she noticed the thin bamboo strips that formed the walls. <BR> <BR>“That’s odd,” she thought to herself, “Why would they make the wall so thin? It’s a perfect getaway.” <BR> <BR>She skimmed past various banzai plants and other agriculture as she climbed the temple. She checked every possible room on every possible floor. She was worried, however, because she had not passed by any guards. When she finally reached the top floor, she found herself in a dark room dimly lit. At the end of the hall, lied her fallen comrade, Jango. <BR> <BR>“Jango!” she yelled to him. <BR> <BR>Just then, ten ninja jumped out and knocked her to the ground. She fought with claws and teeth, and managed to bloody up a few guards, but one came with a syringe. He jabbed the needle into her dark purple skin, and she fell silent. Her limp body was dragged across the floor into a small holding cell. <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>“There it is!” <BR> <BR>Writhe pointed forward and rested the tip of his large claw on a small lump resting on the horizon. <BR> <BR>“That’s the Kawrea region’s volcano,” the Beerock explained, “It’s our final destination. That’s where they’re holding that slimy friend of yours.” <BR> <BR>“Alright,” Keemo yelled over the roaring wings, “Let’s go!” <BR> <BR>After about twenty minutes of cruising through the canopy, the fleet made it into a patch of vegetation outside the temple walls. Keemo noticed movement in the bushes. He immediately sent the tip of his wing thrashing through the thick green leaf.  <BR> <BR>“Ouch!” exclaimed a voice with a thick British accent, “Careful where you whip those thing!” <BR> <BR>A Joker came forth from the brush. Keemo took his fighting stance, but Writhe held him back. <BR> <BR>“Don’t worry,” Writhe tried to placate Keemo’s rage, “He’s a friend. He’s been sent for the same purpose as us; to rescue the Metal Jell.” <BR> <BR>Keemo stopped his flailing and took a good look at the Joker. He actually didn’t seem so bad. He introduced himself to Keemo as Sirus. Then, more movement in the bushes came. Keemo braced himself, but then let down his guard as five more Jokers stepped forward. The first four came and greeted Keemo. They were Sprite, Balish, Cuma, and Kale. The other one didn’t even look at Keemo, but went straight to Writhe. <BR> <BR>“It’s good to see you, my friend,” the Joker spoke in a deep voice. <BR> <BR>“Ah, Diablo, what a pleasure it is. Have you met the Raiden Keemo?” Writhe pointed at Keemo, and Diablo nodded to him. <BR> <BR>“Hello, Keemo of the MDA,” spoke Diablo, “I have heard many things about you and your two friends,” <BR> <BR>Keemo extended a hand to greet him, but Diablo stood back. <BR> <BR>“I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” warned Diablo, “Normal monsters can’t touch us Jokers. We’ll suck the life right out of you.” <BR> <BR>Keemo realized how stupid he just had been. He had attended many coliseum matches with Jokers, and saw what they could do with just a touch of their hand. He remembered a battle where a Joker shot his hand out at a tiger, and after about a minute, the tiger fell limp to the ground. <BR> <BR>“I’m sorry,” said Keemo. <BR> <BR>“Now,” Diablo was serious again, “We’ve already sent the Allure in.” <BR> <BR>“You mean Kala!” exclaimed Keemo. <BR> <BR>“Yes, I think that was her name,” said Diablo, “Anyway, we sent her in and she hasn’t returned. Some of us are getting worried, so some of us must investigate.” <BR> <BR>“I’ll do it!” Keemo was determined to help his colleagues.  <BR> <BR>“I’ll go too.” <BR> <BR>Keemo looked up in awe to see that the Joker Sirus had stepped forward. <BR> <BR>“Okay, now remember you two,” Diablo said, “Even with the Black Hand’s elite aerial combat force here, there’s no way we can defeat the samurai. They outnumber us a hundred to one. Their crossbows will pierce even the Niezhegs’ skin. Our mission is search and rescue, not seek and destroy. If you’re seen, you’re done for.”  <BR> <BR>Keemo gulped. All he needed was for one slacker to catch a glimpse of him. He had no idea how he was going to pull this off. With that, Sirus helped him up the wall and they snuck into the door to the temple. <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>Kala awoke from her slumber after the fight. She didn’t remember anything. When she looked down at the tiny incision in her arm, she remembered the fight, and how the samurai had put her to sleep. It was a week drug, though. It only lasted about 15 minutes.  <BR> <BR>However, Kala felt queasy. She had to stumble to her feet. Her mind was a blur, and she couldn’t concentrate.  <BR> <BR>“They must’ve drugged me while I was asleep,” she mumbled. <BR> <BR>She staggered over to the window as a drunk would stagger out of a bar and she looked across the night sky. It was beautiful, but her mind was not the only blurry picture. She saw about ten moons and ten canopies flying across her mind’s eye. She felt nauseous, and bent down and vomited. She was not reacting well to the drug overdose. With that, she stumbled onto the dusty cot, and closed her eyes. <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>“This way,” Keemo whispered and gestured for Sirus to follow. The Joker quickly flew over to Keemo, and they scanned the hallways. There were beautiful banzai gardens across every path, and the torches provided enough lighting to maneuver through and not be seen. <BR> <BR>They flew across the halls, ducking and weaving as various ninja and samurai walked through the halls. It was very difficult not to be seen, but Keemo and Sirus were managing. They began to sprint down a hallway, when a samurai came through a door way. <BR> <BR>“Halt! What’s the password?” the guard slurred his words, obviously drunk. <BR> <BR>“Dammit!” Keemo slapped the guard with his right wing and sent him careening into a nearby plate of armor. However, it was not enough. The guard stumbled to his feet and screamed, “ALIENS!!!” <BR> <BR>A bell started tolling and there was a pounding coming from the upstairs. They had been spotted, and now their presence was known throughout the building. <BR> <BR>Just then, a team of Garu with katana sprang from the door and put several gashes through Keemo upper body. Sirus whirled into the brawl and opened up two necks and cut off various body parts. The once beautiful halls were now covered in red blood. Sirus aided Keemo through the halls, and they were ambushed again and again. Both Sirus and Keemo had accumulated various cuts, bruises, and gashes. Although none were fatal, the blood loss was extreme.  <BR> <BR>“I’m…,” Keemo stuttered, “Done for…” <BR> <BR>He fell to the ground, and his world turned black…   <BR> <BR>Chap 8 of The MDA and Chap 4 of Open Wounds will be out probably by the weekend. Hope you liked it! -Icelord13

 Two things bugged me in this one... <BR> <BR>1&#41; You say Ninja and Samurai, and I picture a human. Then I remember, that Mews and Hares can be either one in this story, which labels a Ninja or a Samurai, as a creature of my choosing. You also got them mixed up. <BR> <BR>&#34;Just then, ten ninja jumped out and knocked her to the ground.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;When she looked down at the tiny incision in her arm, she remembered the fight, and how the samurai had put her to sleep.&#34; <BR> <BR>Minor, but noticeable... <BR> <BR>2&#41; THE BIG ONE!!! <BR> <BR>&#34;The four right in front of Sirus were -&#91;&#40;&#42;Kale&#42;&#41;&#93;-, Balish, Cuma, and Sprite.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#62;,&#60; Spelling and all! <BR> <BR>Look in: <BR> <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Library: Fan Fiction, Poetry, Birthday List, Links &amp; Non-Fiction Archive: Epics In Progress: A Warrior&#39;s Trek series <BR> <BR> <BR>Marked improvement, however, as your descriptive capabilities and use of adjectives is growing, and I like it!

 As stated, you were a little off with some minor things, week/weak, for example. You seem to have rushed this when you had a hour or two off or something...You have been doing a great job, so keep it up.
