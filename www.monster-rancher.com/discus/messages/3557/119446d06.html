 Crowds of people from all over the world had packed into an arena that could hold 2 million people. The view was horrible for those in the back row so many just watched the big screen projecting the action onto a huge screen that was 50X50. People who spoke many different languages had also arrived and the announcer translated what he said into many different languages. It was time and all the monsters had been unfrozen, broght to life to fight for what they had used to, pride, honor and shear enjoyment.  <BR> <BR>Round 1 had begun a dong had been rung and the monsters had walked out and caught sight of the sunlight that they haven&#39;t seen in years. they had been told what they were there to do and they prepared. Zeke and Fleck had gotten a meal and rested up and when time came they had walked out. An announcer announced them and their accomplishments throughout their career.  <BR> <BR>Zeke stood tall and his shadow cast above that of the much shorter hopper. Zeke&#39;s red eyes glared evily at Fleck. Fleck was calm and showed no fear towards Zeke, Zeke&#39;s vains buldged and his muscles tensed.  <BR> <BR>&#34;BEGIN!!&#34; The universal exclamation of the announcer started the match.  <BR> <BR>Zeke soared high in the sky, he started the match by jumping up as high as he could. He was looking down at the hopper who stood on the ground looking upwards concentrated at the sky. Zeke seemed to float up in the air, he spread out his arms and breathed a sigh of relief. He then looked down at the ground and with the speed of light dashed downwards towards Fleck. Zeke hit the ground gracefully, holding up his body with one of his claws outstrecthed from his body. He was upside down. Fleck had jumped out of the way. Fleck reached out his hand and a blast of fire came ferciously out. Zeke jumped of his claw and over the blast of fire which seemed as a distraction as Fleck smashed him with one of his limp body parts that he flung out. Spit flew from Zeke&#39;s mouth as he grabbed ahold of Fleck&#39;s arm pulling him towards himself. Zeke stabbed at Fleck but, with great control of his body, Fleck flew upwards with his short wing flapping furiously. He let on more blast of fire down on Zeke.  <BR> <BR>As the smoke cleared Zeke was gone. Had he been burnt to death, to ashes? There was no proof of his demise, nothing. Then above Fleck appeared a flash, it was Zeke. He landed a quick elbow down on Fleck&#39;s head. Fleck slammed down onto the cold hard ground. his face bounced off the floor and he skidded a few feet and didn&#39;t move. It seemed like he was out cold but, he bounced to his feet. His nose drew little blood. Zeke, against the nature of his breed drew a smile. He grinned at the thought of having a competative enemy.  <BR> <BR>Fleck hopped back a few feet and reared back both his fists. With all his fury his let out thousands of lashes with his strecthy arms one by one smacking Zeke in the face, body and whatever he could make contact with. zeke was being pummeled but, wasn&#39;t showing any emotion, definatly not pain, atleast. Fleck begun sweating as his attack didn&#39;t do a thing. He tensed his muscle in his right arm and strecthed his out furiously at Zeke. This blow was backed up with alot more power and speed than the first assualt.  <BR> <BR>BOOM!  <BR> <BR>Boom. That was the only sound heard after contact. Zeke hasn&#39;t been challenged in his career. He was just now smashed with a blow with power beyond any thought. Zeke skidded back and was smashed into the side of the arena. Thousands of pounds of debris and rocks from the stadium flew ontop of him. The crowd was silent. Fleck wiped off his forehead and then got back in his stance. The referee went up to raise his hand the winner but, Fleck knocked his hand away, fixed on the spot the Zan was blown into.  <BR> <BR>Fleck then looked down in horror as he could feel something under him. The referee ran off the stage and Zeke shot up from under the ground. Fleck jump out of the way and he threw two flicks at zeke. Knocking him off balance. the he pointed his finger and shot a Lightning bolt at Zeke. A horrible scream jolted out of Zeke&#39;s mouth as he fell to the ground having convulsions. Drool seeped out of Zeke&#39;s mouth as he laid motionless on the ground. Fleck flew into the air and came dashing from the air and slammed into Zeke. smashing him through the ground. Fleck got up from the hole he had smashed his opponent in and let out a flame. Zeke blocked the flames with his claws and hopped out of the hole. He dusted off his body and sped right by Fleck. Then seconds later Fleck flew backwards and hit the ground. he laid there for a second and Zeke lashed with his claws fleck rolled over and Zeke slashed his claws through the ground. Fleck jumped up and was kicked hard in his stomach and he hit the side of the arena. Zeke ran up to finish the match. Fleck flew out his arm and grabbed Zeke&#39;s neck and threw him into the crowd. Zeke hit at about the middle and he shot out from the crowd and Fleck got in his stance and flew towards Zeke. the slammed together and went fist for fist and claw for claw.  <BR> <BR>When the clash was over they both stood hunched over and got back into their stances. They were too tired for fancy moves the both got in close and brutally went swing for swing at each other. They slashed, clawed, spat, bit each other for half an hour. They both gave up no ground. Neither wanted to lose, that meant no championship, no honor and they were soon to be frozen. Zeke grabbed Fleck&#39;s head and began to slam it against his own. The savage ways of Zeke was slowly paying off as Fleck became weaker. fleck went for one uppercut, which proved effective and it knocked Zeke off his feet. Zeke tripped Fleck from his weak stance. Fleck stood up and tensed his muscles once more getting ready for one more blow, he reached back and smashed the Zan. Dust flew up and Fleck had fall unconcious. The pit that had Zeke in it was promptly checked after Fleck was found unconcious and zeke slowly crawled out of it and the referee raised his arm the victor.  <BR> <BR>Zeke had then collasped and had to be carried off the stage. The announcer then commented on how these monsters were willing to give it all to win and would never ever give up, even if it meant dying.

 Try to use Descriptive words, instead of just &#39;Zeke, zeke,zeke&#34; CIP:Zeke stood tall and his shadow cast above that of the much shorter hopper. Zeke&#39;s red eyes glared evily at Fleck. Fleck was calm and showed no fear towards Zeke, Zeke&#39;s vains buldged and his muscles tensed. <BR> <BR>If you reword it, it could go like this: <BR> <BR>Zeke stood tall, his shadow cast above that of the much shorter hopper. His red eyes glared evily at Fleck. The Hopper was calm and showed no fear towards the black, silent sentinel. Zeke&#39;s vains bulged and his muscles tensed at the though of fighting the Fleck. <BR> <BR>See how much more , colorful that was?

 A cool breeze in the warm summer afternoon blew. The roar of the crowd great louder and more uncontrolled as Elizkee stepped out to face off against the lumbering Vox. People cheered for both monsters who were powerhouses in their time stepped out in the middle of the arena. Vox roared in the air. It created a tornado that whirled violently around him. Elizkee wasn&#39;t even baffled by this display. He point his sword at Vox and coldly remarked, &#34;I&#39;ve been enslaved in the horrible freezer after slaughtering my opponents. You will be my next victum. I will kill you.&#34; The referee stepped back two steps and stared in horror at Elizkee.  <BR> <BR>The match had begun. Fire encirlced Elizkee, he raised his sword and let out a scream. Vox moved his arms into of himself. 2 seconds later. Vox laid on the ground.. 3 pieces of the lumbering giant laid lifeless on the ground. He was killed. Elizkee glanced over to the referee and remarked, &#34;There wasn&#39;t any &#34;no killing&#34; rule installed. Thank you.&#34; He chuckled and walked off.  <BR> <BR>It took many men to pick up the pieces of the giant and carry them off. Vox would take 8th place by default. Ruth and Mo Mo had been called out to fight earlier than expected and they got out on the arena and warm-up.  <BR> <BR>The match begun, Mo Mo ran towards Ruth. Ruth quickly shot her arms towards. Mo Mo, smacking himj in the face repeatly. Mo Mo tried to put up a defense but, Ruth wasn&#39;t even getting worn-out. He was sending out blow for blow with a safe 5 foot distance away from his body. Each blow got strong and hurt more. Mo Mo bit one of Ruth&#39;s arms and it sent an electrical surge through his body. Mo Mo flew further back. He stared at Ruth, tears formed in his eyes. Mo Mo&#39;s size triples as he breathed in air and with a shriek of energy a giantatic beam flew towards Ruth. Ruth covered her body and the beam bounced off the armor of the robot and was saftley defected away.  <BR> <BR>Mo Mo, lifted his arms and thousands of petals began to appearing in the air and suddenly they all violently flew down to the ground and slashed at Ruth. They didn&#39;t have an effect either. Ruth&#39;s armor was invincible. Mo Mo rolled into a ball and charged furiously at Ruth. Ruth caught the ball and bounced it a few times on the ground and threw it as high as she could. The ball smashed into the ground and mo Mo was unconcious. Ruth had won effortlessly.  <BR> <BR>2 hours passed after the match and Bree and Stellar had prepared to battle. It was evening and it became signicantly colder. Bree spun his scythe around in his hands Stellar glared at him with unblinking eyes. <BR> <BR>The match had been started and Stellar ran at Bree with unreal speeds. Bree blocked Stellar&#39;s charge with his scythe. Stellar&#39;s horn had punctured the scythe. Bree laughed menacingly and spun the scythe around. Stellar became dizzy and began to vomit. Bree lost his grip on the scythe due to the vomit and it fell to the ground. Stellar unhooked himself and bit Bree on his coat. Bree grabbed him with on of his arms and used the other to pound him in the stomach. The dog was grunting with each blow tom the stomach. The Joker then laughed as he shot s horrible flame at Stellar. Stellar countered it with his own flame. The flames collided and they were at a stalemate. Then Bree put all of his energy towards the flame and the flame had scorched Stellar with the burning of a thousand suns. Stellar had survived the flames. Skin on his front two legs and some of his face were melted and disgustingly seeping off. The roar of the crowd had died down as the watched intently.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Stellar.. Stellar!&#34; Spoke a soft voice..  <BR>&#34;Huh? Wha.. What was that?&#34; Stellar said confused..  <BR>&#34;It&#39;s me! Carson.. Don&#39;t you remember? I found you when you were a puppy.. Abandoned on the street?&#34;  <BR> <BR>Stellar was a street dog when he was growing up. He dwelled in a small surburban town. He was met by a young trainer who was wanting to start a ranch.  <BR> <BR>&#34;But.. I thought you died.. Died... After my last world championshp...&#34; Stellar spoke confused.. The voice never answered.. Stellar had woken up from his day dream with the roar of millions cheering him on. Bree laughed as he waved his hand in the air.  <BR> <BR>&#34;You <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> mutt!&#34; Spoke his old trainers voice.  <BR>&#34;What?!&#34;  <BR>&#34;You&#39;re a disgrace! You don&#39;t deserve to be alive!&#34;  <BR> <BR>Stellar had become engulfed with a horrible sadness as Bree&#39;s laughter became louder. The voice of his old trainer had continued to bash him. Taunting, cursing! It was Bree! It was a mind game and Stellar awoke from it as soon as the scythe of the Joker smashed into the ground. Stellar growled angrily.  <BR>&#34;You.. You must die.&#34; Stellar spoke.  <BR> <BR>The temperature had dropped greatly. It became a winter like atmosphere. Bree stood confused as Stellar growled with anger. A whirl of air surround his Bree sent a flame towards Stellar and the flames froze and shattered on the ground. It began snowing, although it was summer. it began to snow! The snow came down hard the more it fell. Then the snow collectively surrounded Bree. With a shriek of agony from Stellar he shot an ice bomb that was the size of a school bus at Bree. It ran through Bree and smashed into the crowd. It ripped a hole through the bottom portion of the stand. People fled from that area and then continued to watched froma safe distance away as Stellar was advance.  <BR> <BR>The fan had left and the monsters were to be getting ready for the matches tommorrow.  <BR> <BR>The matchup will be..  <BR>In the Championship bracket: <BR>Zeke vs. Stellar  <BR>Elizkee vs. Ruth   <BR> <BR>The Consolation bracket:  <BR>Fleck vs. Bree  <BR>Mo Mo vs. Vox &#40;deceased&#41;  <BR> <BR>Meh.. Kinda rushed but,  made a new topic for chapter 2!
