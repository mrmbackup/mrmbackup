 A young man wearing a uniform that signified that he was staff for the tournament dashed down the hall of the monsters rest rooms. He checked all of the remaining 6&#39;s rooms and continued to curse random things as he dashed from room to room. He stopped his sprint at Elizkee&#39;s room. He glance uncertainly in it and noticed that it was empty. Zeke on the other hand rested comfortly on his sofa.   <BR> <BR>An older man who looked to be in his fifties who wore a neatly trimmed moustache and a horribly worn toupee stopped the young man asking him what all the commotion was. He was shown all of the monsters who were in the consolation round&#39;s room. They were all smeared with blood with a monster collectively dislimbed. The man stared with disbelief he walked slowly in Stellar&#39;s room, which was a personal favorite of his when he was growing up, and ran his finger over the blood that stained the hard wood floor. Tears formed his eyes as he stared blankly at it not knowing what to think.  <BR> <BR>Elizkee&#39;s room was examined through and through but, not was found. No blood, no trace of resistance. The durahan had always been a criminal in his battling career. He was notorious for his violent attacks and relentless style. The man knew who did it and he knew why, it was simple really. Elizkee didn&#39;t want to sit through 4 more matches and he knew if he killed the consolation bracket competitors then he wouldn&#39;t have to sit through any more matches.  <BR> <BR>Fleck&#39;s room was perhaps the most disturbing room of them all. Glass was shattered on the floor and his cot that he slept on was sliced in half. The closet had several holes stabbed in it. The dresser that was placed in his room was chopped in 2. Then laid the rodent&#39;s body. Laid against the wall with a gash that trailed deep into the side of his head.  <BR> <BR>This would be the best kept secret of the tournament. They told the people that the others were frozen due to them &#34;dying&#34;. Zeke knew this would happen but, didn&#39;t care to stop it. He was as anxious as the durahan as well. He laughed to himself on his bed as people rushed through the rooms. He crossed his legs and folded his arms and went to sleep. The finals would be the next day.   <BR> <BR>It was time; this would be the deciding match of the tournament. Everything had now come to this. Elizkee stood straight up holding his sword in his left hand. A light crimson red tint covered the sword and Zeke spotted this and smiled. Zeke stood in a crouched position and unsheathed his claws. A cold glare came from his mouth as he scowled at the slayer. Time seemed to stop as the dong was going to be rung. The man seemed to freeze as he swung the hammer. Everyone had become nervous and the stadium was filled his quick heart beats.  <BR> <BR>DUUUUUUUUUNG!!  <BR> <BR>The sounds signified the match had begun. Zeke tilted to the side and charged full speed. It was too fast for the human eye to see but, it was spotted out with ease by Elizkee. Zeke leaped in the air and let out a fury of swipes with his razor-like claws. Each slash was countered with a swipe from the sword of the humanoid armor. Ear busting clings and clangs echoed throughout the stadium as no one gave ground. Each cling was countered with a clang. The monsters seemed to be standing still as the let out an onslaught of murderous moves. Many cringed under the sound and a few people even placed ear plugs deep in their ear. Elizkee ducked from one slash and Zeke was caught of guard. A precise stab was delivered towards Zeke’s gut. It was caught inches away from the Zan’s stomach and was held there for a few seconds. Then with a quick burst of energy Zeke flung the sword outward and the durahan followed. Elizkee got control of his body and straighten himself out in mid-air and when charging downwards leading with his sword. Zeke knew it was coming but, he wasn’t moving. He stood staring at the sky and then Elizkee landed his sword was lodged deep in the ground and Elizkee was in mid-air outstretched holding onto his sword. Then he turned around. It was too late for him to give a positive counter to Zeke. He was slashed with hundred of ferocious slashed that came one after another. He spun his blade around his body and it stopped Zeke from attacking further. The chopped at Zeke it was blocked with Zeke’s steel claws. A gut wrenching cling was echoing from the last blow. Even Zeke and Elizkee cringed from the noise.   <BR> <BR>Zeke tilted his head from side to side cracking his neck and rotated his arm warm up a little. The durahan ran at Zeke once more, the agile Zan jumped up and placed on hand on Elizkee’s head and did a flip right off of his head. Elizkee turned just to be impaled by Zeke. The sword hit the ground and Zeke stood next to him grinning. Elizkee was shaking as he looked down to see that Zeke’s arm had passed through his stomach plate. Zeke tore his arm out and had noticed many scratches on his arm, which must have been from the durhan’s shredded armor on the sides of the wound. Blood trickled down from Elizkee’s sides as he stared in disbelief at Zeke. He had been punctured. This isn’t supposed to happen to him! Never! Elizkee threw his blade like a javelin at Zeke. Zeke caught in and threw it back. Elizkee ran and grabbed Zeke at unreal speeds for a durahan. He lifted Zeke up from the ground and squeezed tightly on his shoulders. He then moved his grip to Zeke’s neck and squeezed tightly once more. He slammed Zeke into the ground and he smashed through rocks and layers of dirt. Elizkee then jumped into the air and flopped gracelessly in to the hole. An earth shattering boom followed. Screams and slashed could be heard from the whole. It was becoming a real power struggle as Zeke tossed the heavy durahan out of the pit. Zeke jumped out also and they both stood without showing any signs of injury. Zeke had many gashes and Elizkee had an abnormally sized hole in his stomach plate.   <BR> <BR>Zeke tensed his muscles and steam begun to rise as the Zan had no longer been a swift slender looking creature but, a giant with bulging muscles and a huge frame. He let out a scream and the stadium shook violently. A section of the stadium collapsed and people fled. The floor of the arena fell through the ground. Elizkee picked up his sword and watched as Zeke powered up to compete with the durahan’s strength.  A vain ran down Zeke’s head as his muscle mass had tripled. He was becoming a lot stronger and he was alos building stamina. Elizkee watched willingly, this would be his last match and he was certainly going to be put to death for many counts of murder and he wanted his last match to be his most exciting. He thrusted his sword up in the air and let out a bellow as he stared into the sky. It become dark, it almost seemed like night time and then a surge of lightning struck his sword as he screamed at the sky. A flash of lightning had surrounded him and his sword seemed to change. It was no longer just anything like a normal person would own but, it became refined. It was in a shape of a dragon and it’s blade seemed to grow out on one side so it didn’t seem like a decoration.  <BR> <BR>“It’s not only for looks” Elizkee beckoned as he charged at Zeke who had became unbelieved large in muscle mass. <BR> <BR> <BR>I hope this is better overall.
