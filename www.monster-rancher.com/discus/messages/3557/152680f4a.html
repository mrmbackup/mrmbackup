<I>Here&#39;s just a little snippet of an idea of mine. I hope you guys like it. Feed back would be appreciated. If I actually get a reader to respond, I&#39;ll actually work on the Epic I&#39;ve got in mind for it. I&#39;ve read alot of the epics here, but one thing startled me. Few of them have actually been finished! So, I hope to make an enjoyable story and finish it for everyone. Just so you know, html is not my strong suit, so don&#39;t expect anything too fancy.</I> <BR> <BR><U>Ranching Rosie</U> <BR> <BR><I>The sun beat down upon the scrap of land that had been waiting for me these past three years; when my parents had sent me off to a ranching academy, my uncle, a successful rancher known around the world, had bought out a rival rancher to join him as an assistant. Lo and behold, the rancher-turned-assistant&#39;s plot of land, which happened to be on an entirely seperate continent, was given to me as a present.</I> <BR> <BR>Joy. <BR> <BR><I>It was an acre of land, maybe even less, with a pair of small, dilapidated buildings on the grounds, that looked more like compost piles than a cabin and a barn.</I> <BR> <BR><I>&#34;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me...&#34; I muttered as I turned to look at the man who had dumped me in this hole. Uncle Berton simply laughed. &#34;Seriously Uncle B, those things aren&#39;t even good for scrap wood.&#34;: I muttered, kicking up some dirt as I went to inspect the larger of the two which I hoped was the cabin. With little ceremony, I gave the sloping side of it a kick with my boot and a section of the rotting wood fell from the wall, which triggered an even more disturbing site; a mushroom hopped out and ran off to wards the woods that bordered the ranch&#39;s rickety wooden fencing.</I> <BR>  <BR><I>&#34;It&#39;s just a fixer upper. I&#39;ve already hired some of the local townspeople to come out here around noon, and I&#39;d say we&#39;ll get the house and barn liveable by dusk.&#34; Uncle Berton gave a hearty chuckle as the odd creature ran off and added to his ramblings, &#34; I haven&#39;t seen a Mushtan in years!&#34;</I> <BR> <BR><I>I looked at him and sighed before returning to the wagon. Patting the Zuum that had pulled it all the way from the port, I reached into one of my rucksacks and produced a leather bound book. A checklist greeted my eyes as I flipped it open to the first page, and with a fountain pen that I kept in my pocket, I began checking off things from the list I&#39;d made earlier that week. &#34;Let&#39;s see, I&#39;ve got a ranch, so that&#39;s a check. Do I have a house and barn?&#34; I paused and glanced over at the wreckage, &#34; How about I wait till sunset for that?&#34; A laugh broke through my lips as I checked off the few other ranching staples I&#39;d bought back in town, things like straw, potatoes, and meat.</I>  <BR> <BR><I>Uncle Berton was booting in the barn&#39;s decaying walls, so I set down the book and went to help. After all, I couldn&#39;t really let other people do all the work, it was my ranch. My mind wandered back to the rucksacks as I began to haul rotting pieces of wood to a spot in the center of the ranch, where a bon fire would purge the old and make room for the new. At least the basic frames were still good on the barn, though the cabin&#39;s loft was a lost cause by the time noon rolled around and several able bodied men, young and old, showed up with a pair of Zuum drawn carts of their own.</I>  <BR> <BR><I>&#34;Hello Mr. Berton, Miss. I&#39;m Mayor Raynerd, and these are some of the townsfolk who agreed to help. You sure have been busy, eh Mr. Berton?&#34; The leader, an older guy with salt and pepper hair and a pair of grey eyes spoke.</I> <BR> <BR><I>&#34;Ah, it wasn&#39;t much of a problem Mayor. Me and my niece Rosie can do our share too, right Rosie?&#34; He asked me, tousling my sweat dampened red curls. They were my only vanity, each strand a loose coil of copper fire the fell down to my lower back.</I> <BR> <BR><I>&#34;Sure Unc.&#34; I muttered, blushing at the public embarassment. A younger man, maybe a little older than my own 16 years, stepped forward. He was thin, and wore a pair of overalls and boots in a bland tan color; actually, bland was really all he was, from his out fit to his face. Easily forgotten, or so I thought, until he opened his mouth.</I> <BR> <BR><I>&#34;So, where exactly is the rancher at?&#34; said Mr. Gaunt</I> <BR> <BR><B>&#34;Excuse me?&#34;</B> <I>I asked, irritation rising as I narrowed my blue eyes at him.</I> <BR> <BR><I>&#34;Well, Miss Rosie, I was just asking where your partner was. My assistant&#39;s a slip of a girl her self, but where&#39;s your guy, to do the lifting and dangerous stuff?&#34;</I> <BR> <BR><I>&#34;I&#39;m the rancher, thank you very much. I don&#39;t need a guy. If you couldn&#39;t te <BR>ll, I did help my uncle tear down a pair of buildings for the past four hours.&#34;</I> <BR> <BR><I>Mr. Gaunt just shook his head and laughed before the men went to work. He mentioned he was a rancher, so I reasoned that I&#39;d just have to show him how tough I was when I was ready for tournaments.</I>

 Yay! I haven&#39;t checked the board in a while due to computer difficulties, so I just got back online today. Not to mention I finally got my copy of MR4 back; my last one got sold off to a store before I could even finish my file so I could buy a mother&#39;s day present. As such, I&#39;ve spent a good week doing the story line and some extra adventuring. Took a breather before heading to Kawrea, and here we are. Rosie&#39;s adventure will be continued!
