<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>Black Razor</B> on <B>Thursday, April 27, 2000 - 09:02 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 Note:To anyone who&#39;s read these chapters already I&#39;m altering the story slightly. I&#39;ve added a new chapter 7, which means the old one is now chapter 8 and so on. I hope you like the new chapter.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter 7:Prelude to Ascension <BR> <BR>&#34;Then it&#39;s decided,&#34;Said Justice as he stared into a black tunnel.&#34;We&#39;re going down.&#34; They were standing in the house of white birch, half an hour had passed since the old mock had drawn his final breaths. Celine had yet to regain consciousness, now she lay pale and sickly like a wilting flower. Her injuries were much more serious then justice had thought. Finding bandages in the still burning city they had dressed her wounds, but still her health continued to falter. With no one to treat the dryad, justice was out of options. There was one hope of saving celine&#39;s life however. Before his death, white birch told of a secret passage that lay within his own house. The old mock seemed to hint too something that might save her, alas he died before saying exactly what lay inside. Now they stood before it, a dark, earthen tunnel heading underground. <BR> <BR>Wasting no more time justice led his two companions into darkness, carrying celine with them. They traveled down a flight of stairs which were horribly uneven and crumbling after years of disrepair. It was difficult and tedious work, each had to be careful for a single misstep could spell disaster. The jagged steps worked well for Stone claw however, they kept him from sliding down uncontrolably. Finally they reached the bottom and were surrounded by a thick blackness. There was no light whatsoever, the darkness so heavy that none could see through it. Justice could no longer even find the stairs they had just come off. <BR> <BR>&#34;This is crazy, we can&#39;t see anything!&#34;Claw complained&#34;Lets wait till morning. Maybe some light makes it&#39;s way down here.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;She might not make it till morning!&#34;Beatdown said&#34;We can&#39;t let celine die, we promised white birch.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Justice promised white birch,&#34;Claw hissed&#34;Thanks alot old man. Once again your poking around were you don&#39;t belong. We should be chasing our enemies, not messin around here. We should just leave her.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Would you really just leave her to die claw?&#34;Justice said&#34;If so i&#39;m begining to understand why they locked you up in the first place. Beatdown and I will keep going, with or without yo-&#34; He stopped, the ground seemed to tremble slightly. Suddenly it gave way and the floor beneth them collasped, hurlting them into darkness. Justice fell for what seemed an eternity before crashing face first into what felt like solid rock. He pulled himself off the ground, noticing a dent in his armor. He now stood in an underground cavern. It was dark, but still some light illuminated the cave just enough to see, though justice had no idea where it originated from.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Claw! Beatdown!&#34;He called out to them and claw emerged from the shadows, still carrying celine. Beatdown then appeared, she had managed to grab hold of an outcroping of rock during the fall and now climbed down to join them. Both were fine but celine looked much worse from the harsh desent. What was it that white birch wanted them to find in this place? <BR> <BR>Justice decided to continue a bit further, perhaps they may find something yet in this forsaken place. The cavern was huge, the narrow tunnel walked in becoming wider every yard. The walls seemed to resonate a strange energy. Ocean blue jemstones were encrusted in the very stone and appeared to give off a feint light, creating an errie glow all around them. The sound of running water could be heard in the distance. As they desended further it began to drip from overhead. Aside from the annoying sound, the water was also very acidic and burned even the steel armor of justice. Deeper still they went, a light up ahead growing brighter, finally they came to it&#39;s source. <BR> <BR>The tunnel opened wide before them revealing a tremendous cave. To their left, far below them was a large lake filled with a flouresent blue liquid. Before them a long path desended in a spiral before coming to the lakes edge. Sparkling skalagtites hung from the ceiling, which was at least a hundred feet over them. Strangest of all were the gaping holes, each measuring nearly two meters across, lining the stone walls. Approaching one, justice saw claw marks around the sides which suggested that these holes were dug by something other then nature. <BR> <BR>&#34;Whats wrong with the water?&#34;Beatdown asked, holding justice&#39;s shield over her to ward off the drops.&#34;Where do these holes lead? I&#39;m gonna checkem out!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Wait!&#34;Justice grabed her,&#34;It&#39;s pitch black in those tunnels, what if you get lost? Forget them for now...i&#39;m wondering if that liquid is what white birch wanted us to find...&#34; Justice looked at celine, who&#39;s health continued to deteriorate. <BR> <BR>Before he could investigate further however, anouther problem barred the way. Out of one of the holes crawled a large monster the likes of which none had ever seen. It stood nearly seven feet tall, it&#39;s ebony body was bulky and it moved on four insectiod legs. The monster had a small head with no eyes, six black spikes judded out of it&#39;s back and wraped around it&#39;s form, pointing them at it&#39;s prey. Most visible of all were it&#39;s long arms which held talons that seemed composed of some sort of metal. It did not attack and merely stood on the path, blocking their way. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey! Who are you! Let us pass!&#34;Claw yelled but the creature didn&#39;t move an inch. At last it spoke, but none could understand it&#39;s words. Only one coherent word escaped the beasts fanged mouth, &#39;dryad&#39;. As though summoned by the word itself, several more rushed out of their holes and surrounded them. Justice looked for an escape route, the only alternative was to jump over the cliff. That plan was scratched quickly enough, as he glanced over the edge only to find many more creatures waiting around the lakeside.  <BR> <BR>Then, without warning they attacked and were swiftly upon the party. The creatures moved with a speed that seemed impossible for anything of that size. Before he could raise his sword, justice was taken. Two creatures grasped him, he struggled but failed to free himself. Beatdown was also quickly captured but Stone claw was not so easily caught. The trident dropped celine and hurled himself at one of the strange monsters, knocking it to the ground. Justice and beatdown were carried away into the dark tunnels as Celine was scooped up by yet anouther of these foul creatures. The durahan again fought to free himself but the grip of his captors only tightened. The last thing he saw before being pulled into shadow was Stone claw, surrounded by six of the hulking brutes. <BR> <BR>For some time they were dragged into the murky depths. At last they came to what looked like a throne room, probably where the creatures leader resided.  It was an unusual place, the arched ceiling was covered with the blue stones they&#39;ed encountered earliar, filling the entire area with their light. At the summit of a stair was indeed a throne fit for a king. Upon that great seat was a durahan breed. It was black with shining silver on the legs and forearms. Cruel spikes stuck out from it&#39;s shoulders and knees, some even forming a circle around his helm to resemble a crown. At his side was a wicked looking ebon sword, it&#39;s blade sharp and jagged. The shield ladened with metalic shards and could be used as a weapon itself. The throne was made of some kind of stone and covered with intricite designs carved into it. They were very detailed, justice couldn&#39;t imagine one of his captors creating such art.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, look at this. Visitors....&#34;He said towering above them.&#34;It&#39;s been along time since anyone has come from the overworld. I am Edgegar, lord of all you see before you and much that you will never have the pleasure of seeing. I hope your trip was...pleasent.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Shut up! Where is Celine!?&#34;Justice raged and struggled but still couldn&#39;t get free. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes the dryad,&#34;Edgegar shrugged&#34;She&#39;ll live, our medicines are quite effective. Of course she&#39;ll need to be in good health for the merger....&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Why would you do such a thing?&#34;Justice said&#34;Whats going on here! Who are you?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I just told you who I am,&#34;Edgegar said, seeming alittle annoyed&#34;I am lord of this place, ruler of the Zozar. Have you ever seen a pixie/Zozar? I haven&#39;t, and I&#39;m curious to see what happens. You too will have the honor of being combined. Alas, I must extingish your souls in the process but hey, sacrifices must be made.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You can&#39;t do that!&#34;Beatdown said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh course I can,&#34;Edgegar motioned toward his servents&#34;Take them away until i&#39;m finished with the dryad.&#34; The Zozar&#39;s dragged justice and beatdown into anouther black tunnel, desending even deeper into the earth. Soon enough they came to some sort of prision. The two were casually tossed inside and the metal gate shut behind them. There was no light, except for the feint glow of a blue stone on the wall. The three Zozars remained outside as guards, then one said something to the others and the trio left in a hurry. <BR>A few minutes passed, a large form moved toward them from the shadows. It was Stone claw, he used a key to open the lock. <BR> <BR>&#34;Thanks claw,&#34;Justice said&#34;I thought you&#39;d been captured.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;By these idiots?&#34;Claw laughed, before handing justice his sword and shield.&#34;A few things I picked up. Come on, if you wanna escape we&#39;d better move fast. This place is crawling with those freaks.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;But what about celine?&#34;Beatdown said&#34;We can&#39;t leave her behind!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sure we can, if we want to live.&#34;Claw hissed&#34;Now lets get out of here. When they find the mess I made upstairs every one of those things are gonna come looking for us. If you want to survive, this is our chance.&#34; <BR>  <BR>&#34;We&#39;re not leaving without her claw.&#34;The durahan said&#34;She&#39;s still alive somewhere in this cursed place. Now are you coming or not?&#34; <BR> <BR>After a moments hesitation, the trident agreed at last and they set off. Taking the same tunnel that brought them here seemed the best thing to do. What none realized was that the tunnel branched off, and when they emerged from shadow justice realized they had gone the wrong way. They stood now before anouther huge, cavernous area. Peering down from where they were shocked by what they found. Zozar&#39;s were assembling in the pit, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands and more still poured from the tunnels to join their kin. One exceptionally large Zozar stood upon a rock and addressed the crowd in their strange tongue. Justice had no idea so many dwelled beneth the earth, but now, watching them grow into a frenzy, he feared what might happen if they ever attacked the world above.... <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;What?....Where am I?&#34;Celine awoke in a steel cryo chamber. To her left was anouther, a frozen Zozar within. A durahan type monster strode toward her, stroking his blade like a pet cat. <BR> <BR>&#34;Awake?&#34;He said&#34;Your alright I see. Had a pleasent nap?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Edgegar!&#34;Celine realized who her captor was and banged her fist against the glass.&#34;Let me go now!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You remember me, i&#39;m honored, been along time my dear.&#34;Edgegar laughed&#34;I have always admired you dryads, no pixie type lives longer. I&#39;m most curious to see the result of this combination....&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You can&#39;t, what about the deal you made with white birch?&#34;Celine said&#34;You swore to stop your twisted games and remain here. What do you think will happen if you break the agreement?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You surprize me celine,&#34;He said&#34;I never thought of you as a liar. I already know the mock lord is dead and your little city ruined. Therefore...&#34; Edgegar brought out a long paper document and tore it in half.&#34;All agreements are hereby void. I&#39;ll do whatever I want with you. But I don&#39;t want to kill you my lovely, in fact, I&#39;ll let you keep your soul after the merger. You need only to remain here afterward, by my side. It&#39;ll be like old times, Ah, sweet nostalgia.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Never,&#34;Celine said defiently&#34;Not a chance in hell.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Huh? I&#39;m sorry, did I say you had a choice? Forgive me,&#34;Edgegar walked over to a control panal.&#34;But your going to be combined anyway. You will remain here with me and bear witness to our ascension. But enough talk, it&#39;s time.&#34; <BR>Edgegar reached for the button that would begin the entire combining process. Suddenly he was hit with a blast of energy and fell to the ground. Celine turned and saw Justice, beatdown and Stone claw. The fairy hare jump kicked the cryo chamber, the glass shattered, freeing celine. Before Edgegar could recover justice attacked the control panel. Meanwhile, claw decided to take advantage of edgegars vulnerable position. But their enemy was far from helpless. Edgegar thrust his palms forward, black energy building between them. <BR> <BR>&#34;Lights Bane!&#34;He cried, a wave of dark energy struck the trident with such power some of his stone chiped off. Claw fell back painfully and looked at his chest, a small crater was visible.&#34;Ouch, that must hurt.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Nice shot Edge,&#34;Claw mocked, hiding his pain&#34;But we&#39;ll have to be going now.&#34; Justice then lead the retreat as several Zozar&#39;s appeared. Never ones to do anything without the lords go ahead, they waited.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Hmmm, Edge...I like that.&#34;He said as the Zozar&#39;s awaited his order.&#34;What are you standing around for!? Bring them back here, in bite sized pieces if you must! No one escapes from...Edge, lord of the Zozar. Has a nice ring to it, hahahahaha.&#34; <BR> <BR>Justice and the others ran through the mazelike tunnels. Celine led the way, saying she knew a way out. Finally they came to a path that went up instead of down. It wasn&#39;t long before they found an opening, the sunlight pouring through, piercing the darkness. They had been down there all night and morning had come. Climbing out of the earths cold clutches, justice was glad to behold the sun again. Even better was what he saw next, half a mile away was a large military camp...with the flag of the IMA rippling in the breeze. <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter 8:Raising The Dark Raven  <BR> <BR>&#34;Please forgive me!&#34;A purebreed dragon begged before the dreaded Master as Vor, Jakira and Liqua watched on. It had been one day since returning from the dryad forest with the masters prize and now Vor waited patiently to give his full report. They stood in an enormous, metal walled chamber deep within the dormant volcano their leader called home. A few very dim lights gave just enough light to see the large dragon plead, but as always the master remained in the shadow, the rest of the room like a great void. As their eyes adjusted to the darkness a huge shape could be seen, writhing and pulsing.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you not the scout sent to patrol sector eight?&#34;The Master replied as a video screen lit up above them showing a map of the entire continent. The dragon nodded &#39;yes&#39;. &#34;Both Moo and the IMA have recently completed bases in that area. Why was I not informed when the first bricks were laided down?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;W-well sir, I-ack!&#34;Several powerful tendrils emerged from the darkness and wraped around the dragons limbs and neck. The mighty beast struggled but couldn&#39;t break their steel grip.  <BR> <BR>&#34;You don&#39;t seem to realize my position,&#34;The Master said.&#34;As things are, I am vulnerable. Until this base has been reactivated, I am in danger. If Moo were to locate this place and attack, all these long, dark years would be for naught. That is why I must moniter my enemies at all fronts at all times.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;I didn&#39;t &#40;ack!&#41; realize master, I am a fool.&#34;The dragon choaked out and the master released him. After a few breaths of hot air and a long sigh of relief he bowed before him.&#34;It will not happen again.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Indeed...&#34;A huge claw, as large as the dragon himself, sprang from the shadows and grasped him. The dragon struggled, attacking the claws natural ebony armor with fire. Nothing was effective. At last, scraping his nails along the steel floor the dragon was dragged into darkness. The flesh tearing sounds that followed disturbed even the carnage hardened warriors as Jakira began to feel sick to her stomach and Vor shifted uneasily where he stood. Liqua simply stared on, the usual blank look on his face. Finally the mutilated body was thrown toward the far wall. Vor noticed the dragon was missing his head, among other body parts. After a brief moment of silence the Master simply said, &#34;Anything else?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, my report.&#34;Vor said&#34;The regenative powercell has been retrieved from the dryads and is being installed as we speak. You need not worry about your vulnerablilty much longer.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;You&#39;ve done well my warriors,&#34;Said the Master as the vid screen changed to a close up of a small island.&#34;I have new assignments for you. Vor, take Flood and Darklon, proceed to this island and secure it. Be sure to clean out any human infestation. Jakira, take grapper and go to the city of Torlormec. There, you will find a stronghorn. Recruit him as my newest warrior, he will make a fine addition. Now go, and serve your Master.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Master...&#34;Vor said&#34;A group of monsters has tried to interfer with us and I fear they will do so again. A durahan, a trident, a fairy hare and a dryad.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;If she&#39;s still alive that is,&#34;Jakira added with a sadistic grin.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Any who would oppose my will,&#34;The master said.&#34;Must be destroyed. Kill them.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;By your will, Master!&#34;Vor and Jakira said in unison and turned to liqua who was staring off into space. &#34;Oh,&#34;He said at last&#34;Yes, by masters will....liqua&#39;s head hurts.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#40;Core power at five percent and rising&#41; <BR> <BR>Shielka stood deep in the underground base not very far below the masters own chambers. She stood now in a large room filled with machines, computers and metal devices, most were powered down. It was almost pitch black, a few very dim overhead lamps provided little against the thick gloom. One computer spoke and stated that the power reserves had been raised to ten percent. A few lights and buttons began to flash off and on. Near her, Talus worked furiously at the controls. He was a Gaia, a mix of Henger and golem. He was also the closest thing she had to a friend in this place.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Once we arrive at 60 percent power,&#34;He said as the power reached 15.&#34;I&#39;ll try the main power and see if we can get some light in here. After working in the dark for years and years it would be a welcome change. In fact, if you hadn&#39;t come along to keep me company once in a while I may have blown a fuse. None of the other warriors come down here and appreciate my hard work. I break my back day after day and they don&#39;t even-&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Um, what about the other systems?&#34;She tried to change the subject knowing Talus would go on for hours.&#34;You know, the lifesupport and things like that?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;You know I converted the life support to run on thermal energy years ago.&#34;Talus replied as he punched in some more commands. Power was now at 30 percent.&#34;Just how do you think we&#39;re able to live down here!? It&#39;s because of my hard work! Well, I can&#39;t take all the credit, you and the others brought back that power cell, as well as the spare parts I needed to fix this pile of scrap!&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;The master always told me,&#34;Shielka said&#34;When I was little, that this place is more then what it seems. He nev-&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Power at 60 percent and still rising. Here we go,&#34;Talus clanked over to the main switch and turned it on. For the first time in centuries the base sputtered to life. The overhead lights shined as brightly as the sun and became brighter still as the power level increased. The light hurt her at first but as the daina&#39;s eyes adjusted she saw the place clearly for the first time. Other then the secondary control panel that spaned the length of the room she saw a row of six conveyer belts. Each one attached to an oval shaped machine. The master had told her about these, they were monster generators, smaller versions of the same devices that created Moo himself in ancient times. They were perhaps the very last in existence. But there was much more she didn&#39;t understand. A computer screen showed a map of a machine that resembled a raven.  <BR> <BR>&#34;What is this??&#34;She wondered aloud and Talus came to her.  <BR> <BR>&#34;The map of this very base, you didn&#39;t know?&#34;He could tell from the confused look on the daina&#39;s face that she had not the slightest idea what was happening.&#34;Allow me to explain. During the ancient wars of long ago, before moo&#39;s temporary imprisionment; a group of humans built this place for one purpose, to destroy him. They did not want to put their faith in anouther monster to save them, after all, moo himself was a monster. So this place was created, but never quite finished. By some miracal it remained buried here unharmed. Don&#39;t ask me how the master discovered it but he did and set me to work repairing it. That was years ago....&#34;  <BR>&#34;You mean,&#34;Shielka said&#34;This place is...&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;A battle ship, a weapon the rivals even moo&#39;s floating fortress....&#34; Talus finished&#34;The Dark Raven.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Attention....&#34;Said the voice of the Master&#34;At long last...after all these years...the Dark Raven lives again! This day marks a new begining, the reign of the master has come. All hengers report to control stations, All warriors stand by...Talus! Ready the primary weapon! We&#39;re going for a test flight...against one of Moo&#39;s bases.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Erupting from the volcano like a tainted phoenix, the Raven thundered across the wastland. It wasn&#39;t long before they had arrived at their destination. One of Moo&#39;s newly built training grounds. Below the monsters did moo&#39;s bidding not knowing that they were mere seconds from death. Approaching the base the IMA army charged forth, they too would feel the Ravens power. <BR> <BR>&#34;Prepare to fire primary weapon at lowest setting.&#34;Said the Master.  <BR> <BR>Talus set the weapon to it&#39;s lowest power, 5 percent.&#34;Fire!&#34;
