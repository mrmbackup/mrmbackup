well, after trashing the latest pixie story, i got to thinking, can i do better? i&#39;m going to give it a try, anyway. a good pixie story, in my opinion, should involve aspects of &#34;beauty and the beast&#34;. traditionally, the beast is male, but i think we can stand a gender switch.  <BR> <BR>Of course, the greatest taboo in IMA is that against trainer/monster sexual relations. And, as some of the posters here have pointed out, the most alluring female monster is the pixie. So, it&#39;s not surprising that a number of stories about forbidden love between pixie and trainers are told to impress upon young trainers the danger involved, and this is probably the most widely told. There was a trainer, a great trainer - handsome, urbane, sophisticated. He was married, happily, or so he thought. He had trained a large number of pixies, and thought himself more or less immune to their physical charms. He was a great trainer, possessed of many legends cup and other great cups, and worked long hours on the job.  <BR> <BR>There came into his stable a new pixie. Now, trainers have a saying about a promising youngster - &#34;she could be any kind.&#34; That was said quite often about this pixie. She had a pixie&#39;s normal high int, but with even greater speed than most, and an unusually high skill attribute. Most unusually, she was willing to work long and hard on life and def, something most pixies tended to ignore. The trainer worked long and hard on this pixie, seeing that his first hall-of-fame monster in a few years might be at hand.  <BR> <BR>This pixie was different, though. Something about her - a look in her eye, a tilt of her head, showed unusual self-awareness and insight. Indeed, she was an exceptional pixie. She was intensely interested in humans, and had pieced together much of how the human world was constructed, and how it worked, from hearing the trainer&#39;s conversations with others. She knew what her role was, and how humans viewed monsters such as herself. She knew that most humans, despite her semi-humanoid appearance, considered her hairy and disgusting.  <BR> <BR>And she loved the trainer. At first, she loved him like monsters love their trainer - showing fondness,which threatened to become doting. As she grew older, she began to love him as she imagined human women loved their men. In fact, she had resigned herself to the fact that the greatest expression of her love would be to keep it to herself - she knew that only disgrace and ruin could come to the trainer because of it, unless he rejected her outright. No, nothing good could come of her feelings - better to supress them. He certainlly showed no signs of being aware of her feelings.  <BR> <BR>A monster&#39;s life is battle, especially one as powerful as the pixie. We trainers can sometimes become desensitized to the reality of monster battle, but, believe me, the monsters never do. Being stabbed by spears, claws, and knives; being struck by walls or fists the size of walls; or being subjected to rays and beams that did all sorts of unnatural things to you - no, one never got used to that Monsters knew that life is short and brutal, and it can end at any moment.  <BR> <BR>IMA had had a string of bad luck in its battles with FIMBA, and there was a lot of pressure to get better results. The pixie and the trainer were already famous, when the word came from Pabs - the pixie was to be IMA&#39;s S level representative. They got on the plane and flew off to FIMBA for the battle.  <BR> <BR>The battle was tied going into the final battle. The pixie had to take on the legendary Akirel. She was nervous at first, and hesitated. Akirel landed some powerful attacks, and only her unusual life and def saved her from going down for good. Now she was thinking, and began chipping away at him with a bang here; a bolt there, staying away from his heavy attacks. Then, a rare moment of foolery from her foe. She rose up and deliverd gigaray, double strength! He fell. She sank to the ground, exhausted - what was this she heard? He was dead! She had killed him!  <BR> <BR>anguish, celebration, sorrow, elation all rolled into one. Later that night, the trainer goes to the stables to see how the pixie is doing. They are alone. He finds she can express herself quite well - she can even talk a little. She&#39;s not the first pixie to pick up a little human speech, but the trainer is surprised by the candor and depth of her expressiveness about the incredible events of the previous day, and what awaits them back in IMA. They spend the night together talking, gesturing, coimmunicating, consoling/congratulating each other.  <BR> <BR>The trainer comes to think of her as an equal, not as a monster. This is where he crosses the line. He is unprepared for the dismay he feels when he climbs aboard the plane, and sees her being loaded into cargo in a cage.  <BR> <BR>They get back to a hero&#39;s welcome. He thinks of her differently, and she notices. But both &#34;know that it&#39;s wrong...but it&#39;s much too strong&#34;. She is an equal, but an equal with pretty breasts. He notices them now, a little too much. she notices him notice, etc.  <BR> <BR>Eventually, they get together again, at night. Except this night is different. They declare their love, and indulge their passion for each other. They make plans to meet again, to keep it all a secret, and hope they can make it last. How naive!  <BR> <BR>Coltia. Forgot about her, didn&#39;t you? Well, so did the lovers. Colt is the 13 year old apprentice. She loves the trainer too. He brushes her off, discourages her - she&#39;s just a kid, after all. She is extrememly ambitious, and channels all her pent-up energy into showing the Trainer that she can be great too. She is there late, mucking the Bakus&#39; stables, and catches the lovers in flagrante delicto.  <BR> <BR>Now, I have come to care about my characters too much, and it hurts me to write the necessary ending. Colt tells. Trainer and pixie are seperated. The trainer refuses to renounce his love for the pixie. He is defrocked, humiliated, and resigns in disgrace. The pixie feels betrayed - she saw this ending, and wanted the trainer to cut her loose and think of his own survival. She is devastated by the turn of events. She becomes withdrawn, and untrainable. Eventually, she is frozen forever, a lesson to all other presumptuous monsters. Colt gets her 15 minutes of fame, but, when she goes back to the ranch, she finds she is no longer welcome as a trainer&#39;s apprentice. She goes from ranch to ranch, but a conspiracy exists, and colt will never be a trainer.  <BR> <BR>even at this length, this is a thumbnail sketch of the real story. all comments, good and bad, are appreciated.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, February 11, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>You need a good picture of a Pixie, i&#39;ll give you one...  <BR>  <BR> <BR>Do you want a pic like this or what?

You just got right to the point, didn&#39;t you?  <BR> <BR>You said that this is only a &#34;thumbnail sketch&#34; of the real story. Are you working on a story/book about humans and pixies?  <BR> <BR>Now we&#39;re going to need an &#34;artistic creations&#34; category so that we can put this thread inside.

Or was there another pixie story on the board that I&#39;m not aware of?  <BR> <BR>By the way, are you a writer?  <BR> <BR>-- RNA &#40;<A HREF="mailto:RNA@Ribosome.nuc">RNA@Ribosome.nuc</A>&#41;, February 15, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>no - i just keep thinking of ways to expand the story and slow it down, much like celious has done so well in his big cat battle saga.  <BR> <BR>i have written and published many things, but all trade publication sort of material - no fiction.  <BR> <BR>-- torey luvullo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:dst10000@compuserve.com">dst10000@compuserve.com</A>&#41;, February 15, 2000.

 I liked it, Torey! But Colt&#39;s desserts weren&#39;t just enough.How about, she gets control of the pixie, goes to combine her, and the Pixie manages to turn the tables. Colt gets combined with a.... ?????. Maybe that should be another poll. <BR> <BR>  Anyway,keep writing.

 I&#39;ve just read this story for the first time. I really felt the pain involved. Please keep this story posted for other late comers to see as well. I couldn&#39;t see the pictures that were mentioned. This story is a very good reason to have an art page. Did you ever complete the story the way that you wanted to? You&#39;ve inspired me to try writing my own. Mybe not. Alot of my ideas of what I&#39;d like to do with pixies might get me banned or locked up.

 thanx, carl, and no.  actually, this story was a response to a real bad &#34;pixies are sexy, hyuk hyuk&#34; post on b campbell&#39;s old board.   if you have an old computer, you never would have seen the pictures - i never saw anything but a red x with my semi-old computer.  as you can see, it is not so much a story as an outline of a longer one - what i would do, if i decided to do it, would be to fill in detail in between.  maybe start with a titanic style flashback from the old pixie, then fill in some of the detail of how a monster-rancher 2 society &#91;with actual crowds of screaming drunks watching monster battles, and actual trainers getting rich on the disposable hides of pixies, arrowheads etc.&#93;, would actually work. <BR> <BR>i would love to read anything you would care to write.  anything too explicit, of course, i would regretfully delete.

<B>?!</B> I didn&#39;t know that you&#39;re a moderator. I had thought that Lisa was the only one. <BR> You mentioned &#39;disposable hides of pixies&#39;. I hadn&#39;t thought of their hides as being disposable. I would at least try to market them to cover inflatables or the Cherry 2000.
