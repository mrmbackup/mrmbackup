 Hey dudes!This is the 1st of 3 Chapters.Check out the Prologue if you wanna understand more!Anyways here goes nothing! <BR> <BR>2 years later....... <BR>&#34;Ok Pyro,Sneezle,Fang!Feeding time!&#34; said X.At that Pyro the Garu,Sneezle the Baku and Fang the Tiger ran towards their breeder,X.The 3 monsters were the monsters of X a young breeder.They were all having a normal and fun life.Nothing seemed to hard or to dangerous for them...... <BR> <BR>But 1 day while they were taking a stroll at Ryuwn.............. <BR>&#34;Tickets Tickets!Tickets to see the Great Zio the Tiger do some tricks!See him and some other amazing monsters do tricks!Just 50 bucks and you&#39;ll have 1 ticket!!!!!&#34; said a Ticket-selling man walking back and forth talking to people.X thought then decided to watch the trick show.&#34;Hey,4 Tickets please!&#34; said X.Soon enough he had the tickets at his hands.He and his monsters then walked along Ryuwn until 7:00PM which was when the show would start.... <BR> <BR>Later that night...... <BR>X along with his monsters walked to the show.Then the play began.First the star of the show Zio who was a Blue Tiger started the show by doing a few tricks like running backflips and swinging on vine-like curtains.Soon the other monsters did their own tricks and on the show went on.Soon enough X fell asleep then Pyro fell asleep on so on and on.But X and Fang are both awoken by a jolt.They see the people screeming and running.&#34;Fang can you sense what&#39;s wrong?&#34; X asked.Fang replied by nodding.Fang ran towards the stage which was now nearly destroyed.X followed Fang all the way to the roof of the stadium.There they saw a monster which they had never seen before.It was crimson red and a bit black,had big straight wings,a short orange tail and big long duck feet.They saw that the monster was breathing fire on the roof but his tail was electrifying the pipes leading to the water system of Ryuwn.His wings on the other hand were making icy winds and freezing the wires above it which connect to the Main Power Plant of Ryuwn!&#34;Fang get ready!&#34; said X.Fang got into his batte position.He growled at the creature.The creature didn&#39;t mind him.Soon Fang got annoyed and tried to charge it but the creature flapped his wings so hard Fang&#39;s feet got frozen!Pyro and Sneezle soon woke up.They got up the roof too and helped out.&#34;Pyro,Sneezle!Perfect now we can wop that monster&#39;s butt!Go!&#34; shouted X since the winds were so strong that it was so hard to hear.When the monster saw the Garu and the Baku he stopped destroying more of the city.Instead he flew high and then said a few words &#34;Foolish monsters!None of you have a chance against me!I am the almighty Gargantus!!!&#34;.After those words Gargantus shot out a huge meteor ball towards the stadium.After the shot he quickly flew away.&#34;Oh no!&#34; said X.&#34;Some people are still in the stadium!We have to stop the meteor before it&#39;s too late!&#34;.Pyro the Garu on the other hand said &#34;No!We can&#39;t stay here!We&#39;re gonna die!&#34;.Sneezle the Baku agreed but Fang who&#39;s feet were no longer frozen agreed with X.&#34;Alright we&#39;ll leave the roof but we&#39;ll make sure all the people get out of the stadium!&#34; said X.All his monsters agreed.So they walked down the stairs and saw that there was chaos....on the east side of the stadium the Emergency Escape Exit was burning and on the west side was filled with thunder because of it&#39;s overcharged wires.&#34;What are we gonna...&#34; but before Pyro could finish his sentence they saw a Mocchi performer stuck under a pile of chairs.&#34;Heeeeeellllpppp!&#34; cried the powerless Mocchi.&#34;Ok guys new plan....get outta here.I&#39;ll follow later!&#34; said X.&#39;Wait but what about you?&#34; asked Sneezle but before X could hear it a huge part of the roof fell right infront of the 3 monsters.&#34;Come on!&#34; said Fang to his friends.Soon the monsters were out of the stadium.But X was still inside and the stadium was burning and there was no way out!But he continued torun to the Mocchi.He finally got to the Mocchi.&#34;Heeeeeelllppppppp!&#34; cried the Mocchi again.X tried lifting the chairs off the Mocchi but the chairs were too heavy.He tried again and was able to push the chairs off the Mocchi.The Mocchi was now unconcius.He got the Mocchi and carried him on his arms.He then said &#34;.....Oh no1I&#39;m locked in!Wait the roof!&#34; he said.He then ran up to the roof.He went to the edge with the Mocchi still in his arms.&#34;Man that&#39;s high...wait!Sneezle!If I jump on Sneezle&#39;s soft skin I&#39;ll be ok...I hope...oh well!&#34; he said to himself.He then walked back a few steps then jumped the roof trying to land on Sneezle.When Pyro saw them he yelled &#34;Sneezle look up catch them!&#34;.Sneezle looked up and saw them.He waited then caught them.&#34;That was wild!&#34; said Fang.&#34;You can say that again!&#34; said X.The 5 then went to a medical hospital.There they left the Mocchi at the hands of a nurse. <BR> <BR>3 days later......... <BR>&#34;Look at this!&#34; said X.He showed his monsters the daily newspaper: <BR> <BR>-----DAILY MONSTERPAPER----- <BR>      CHAOS AT RYUWN <BR>3 days ago the Ryuwn Performance Stadium was nearly completely destroyed.No one got a photograph of anything but people are spreading a rumor that 1 breeder along with his Tiger,Garu and Baku tried to stop a mysterious figure on the rooftop of the Stadium.We had a witness and he gladly accepted this short interview.He is Mr.Morchi the Mocchi. <BR> <BR>Rex Roldan:Hi Mr.Morchi!I am Rex Roldan you can call me Rex even though I am human.Hahahahaha! <BR>Morchi:Hello Rex.What do you want to ask me? <BR>Rex Roldan:Well I heard that you disagree with the fact that the breeder should be called a &#34;hero&#34;.Is this true? <BR>Morchi:Yes Rex.Because why would anyone save a city or a few people and then suddenly run off?!They must have done something wrong. <BR>Rex Roldan:Ah I see...so you think it&#39;s a setup? <BR>Morchi:Precisely.I think the bird thing and the breeder and the monsters are all part of a team.My guess is that they tried to start a plot and then they would try and save it and try to call themselves &#34;heroes&#34;. <BR>Rex Roldan:Ah!Well you heard it folks.Our very own Morchi the perfomer.Well that&#39;s all the time we have see ya folks! <BR> <BR>&#34;I can&#39;t believe it!&#34; said Fang angrily.&#39;Neither can I!&#34; said Pyro and Sneezle.&#34;Yeah!We saved him and that&#39;s how he thanks us?!&#34; complained X.&#34;But wait that&#39;s not all!It says here that the bird-like figure attacked Togle&#39;s Monster Associatiion and is headed for Togle&#39;s Eastern Monster Coliseum.&#34; continued X...... <BR>&#34;Well what are we doing here?&#34; asked Pyro.&#34;Yeah Pyro&#39;s right,let&#39;s prove to them that we&#39;re real heroes!&#34; said Fang standing up.&#34;Yeah!&#34; agreed Sneezle.X took one more gulp of his softdrink and stood up.&#34;Then it&#39;s settled!Let&#39;s GO!!!&#34;. <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter 1 End <BR>To be continued............... <BR> <BR>&#40;Tell me what you think dudes!Is it nice,is it boring,does it need work anything!If you have suggestions tell me so I can make it better.Comments accpeted too&#41;
