 Elizkee clenched his blade tightly as he stared coldly at Zeke. The darkness had cast over the stadium. The crowd had become deathly silent and gazed in awe as the arena had stopped crumbling to bits under the shear force of Zeke’s power transition. Zeke’s muscles tightened as he clenched his fist and ran at the Durahan. Elizkee placed his sword in front of him and in an instant he was gone. Zeke whipped his body around and swung his arm violently backwards. He let out a roar as the fist of the mighty Zan met the blade of the lethal Durahan.  It was locked in a stalemate, Zeke’s upper body was twisted around stopping the surely death slice that Elizkee was about to deliver.   <BR> <BR>Then in the heat of the moment Zeke whipped his legs around smashing the Durahan backwards. He sliced through a layer of the stadium and more people fled. The stadium was becoming bare with people scattering left and right. Zeke leaped in the air and he raised both hands above his head. The darkness made him invisible to Elizkee and then a ball of dark energy came flying down. It crashed down on Elizkee and exploded. The explosion ripped through layers of ground and it tore through the stadium and destroyed many neighboring buildings. Zeke dashed down towards where Elizkee should have bee. He was missing from the spot contact was made. Within seconds many gashes were being sawed into the Zan’s muscular body. Dark purple ooze slowly seeped out of the wounds that the sword had been doing. Then a pillar of dark clouds had come out of the wounds and Elizkee could no longer view Zeke. He searched thoroughly looking at every place in the arena.   <BR> <BR>Lights were turned on, they seemed blinding to those up near them but, they are all that could help see the action. Many people still watched faithful as the monsters searched each other for another chance to land a blow. The pillars of smoke that came from Zeke’s wounds seemed to heal them as well. He showed no sign of pain or even a mark was on the Zan’s body. Zeke jumped quickly into the light smashing many light bulbs and ripping out wires that ran through the large lamp. There were 5 lights and Zeke tried to rip through the second but, was impaled by five quick stabs by the blade of Elizkee. Zeke fell slowly to the grow as the purple ooze was flung out. Elizkee through the sword at Zeke who was falling. It passed right through the Zan and he pounded against the ground and the ooze from his body burned holes in the ground.  <BR> <BR>Elizkee raised his hand outwards and the sword quickly shot up to his hand. Elizkee pointed his sword, tip first, at Zeke who laid, recovering, from the wounds and a large ball of energy appeared. It was surrounded by many streaks of lightning and the crowd that was watching had disappeared. Many cars were on their way out of the city to escape the fight that was getting out of control. The ball of energy grew and grew with each passing second it was shot the second that Zeke stood up. The ball collided with Zeke and he held it out trying to keep it from smashing down on him. The ball was thrusting itself through Zeke but, he was putting up a resistance and keeping himself safe. Lightning surrounded Zeke as he let out a blood curling scream. <BR>  <BR> <BR> <BR>Short and sweet. More coming up.

Gah. Spelling errors, grammar errors. On a note, using spell check only means you fix what isn&#39;t spelled right. some words, Sheer and shear, for example, ain&#39;t picked up. In other words, get a peer editor. Icelord is one, CHB is in the ring, as am I. <A HREF="mailto:Imstucknherehelp@aol.com">Imstucknherehelp@aol.com</A>. It makes all the difference.

 I did this on Word beforehand. How I spelled stuff wrong amazes me. I&#39;ll take your advice and get a peer editor... I guess.

 Spelling errors weren&#39;t as bad as the first few, but still persisted. Some spelling of words is missed by the Word spellcheck &#40;I.e. There and Their&#41;. <BR> <BR>But, like he said, I can proof read if you want, but many of us would.
