 De&#39;spyre jerked his scythe back, his lips had leveled out into an uncertain quivering. Purple haze manifested around the bottom of his cloak, in case this went to the air or perhaps he was planning on running. His eyes winced slightly as he stared at the massive form of Roketh. The scythe Roketh was holding began to surge with black lightning, then poof, was gone. <BR> <BR>&#34;Roketh, is that…you?&#34; Galin asked in disbelief. <BR> <BR>Roketh turned his head slightly and said, &#34;You guys need a little help?&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin chuckled a bit, then coughed up a small stream of blood, which ran slowly off his bottom lip. Roketh knew he needed help, they all did. <BR> <BR>&#34;My…Lord…&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh glanced over his other shoulder to see a Phoenix struggling to stand. He did succeed, didn&#39;t exactly balance, but did stand, &#34;There is not…much time.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I understand.&#34; Roketh said as he walked towards the firebird. <BR> <BR>&#34;NO!&#34; A loud scream was heard as several, purple bolt nailed the Phoenix in the side. Naturally, the giant bird toppled. Roketh turned sharply to see the Joker barreling at him, &#34;I&#39;m tired, that&#39;s all. No one is stronger than me!&#34; <BR> <BR>De&#39;spyre was flying at Roketh sideways, obviously hoping to cut him in half horizontally. Roketh held his left hand up lazily. All of a sudden, a loud boom was heard, and the Joker began spiraling into the air, on the back of some unseen air current. About 20 feet up he fired a blast of violet haze into the stream, and it halted. He got his bearings and gazed down on the Dragon in disbelief. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now, Lord of Lords, before it is too late.&#34; Blazemost spoke slowly as he held out a wing. <BR> <BR>Roketh grasped the end of it with his right hand, and was immediately lost in the ensuing firestorm. A column of fire raged strait upwards. Not just any fire, liquid fire, lava. A swirling tornado of flames engulfed them both. It went up as far as any of them could see, with virtually no end. In a blink, the fire dispersed and faded. De&#39;spyre looked on from his purple perch in dismay. <BR> <BR>Everyone could see Roketh now. The other lords had given him their strength, but not their entire bodies. Blazemost was gone, completely. The ground around Roketh was scorched. The massive Dragon himself was on one knee, his hands clasped together as if in prayer. He stood slowly, and opened his hands. A small glow was inside. Everyone was amazed when it began to move and a baby Phoenix bobbed up with several squeaks. <BR> <BR>Roketh walked over to Dadge, never opening his eyes, &#34;Take care of him, Trainer Dadge.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge was breathless. The baby Phoenix was not on fire, merely glowing. Dadge guessed when it matured that its flames would grow. Now, you could hold it and feel nothing more than slight warmth and the tiny heartbeats of the young monster. Dadge held it to his chest before quietly saying, &#34;With my life.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You all should leave. The Jill constructed some form of underwater craft, they&#39;ll help you now.&#34; Roketh said as he turned to the Joker in the sky, who was panting more than ever. <BR> <BR>As the others started down the edge of the dormant volcano towards some form of a vessel, they all glanced back at Roketh, who had not opened his eyes since merging with Blazemost. He opened them now, and fire licked the top of his brow. He clinched his teeth and fire streamed out in small flickers. The others loaded up and left back to the Jill metropolis, praying that Roketh now had the strength to defeat this foe. <BR> <BR>On the way back, a small medical tended to their wounds. As they did, Galin couldn&#39;t help but ask, &#34;Is he complete now? Was that the last Lord?&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge shook his head. He had already removed his battle gear, and now comforted a rather sleepy baby Blazemost, &#34;He still has Grendel to go.&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin looked at him stupidly, &#34;No he doesn&#39;t.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Dadge asked, slightly confused. <BR> <BR>Galin shook his head now before adding, &#34;You didn&#39;t see that wind attack he pulled over on De&#39;spyre?&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge&#39;s heart sank. He felt empty at the realization that Grendel was the Lord of Air, or Lord of the Winds as he liked to say. He glanced at the Jill sowing up a rather nasty cut on Moonshadow&#39;s side, &#34;Is it true?&#34; <BR> <BR>All the Jill on the craft bowed their heads sorrowfully, and that was more than enough to get the answer Dadge never wanted to hear. <BR> <BR> <BR>Meanwhile…Back on the battlefield… <BR> <BR>De&#39;spyre looked down on the Dragon with great terror. He knew there was only one solution. <BR> <BR>&#34;Looks like I have no choice but to evolve again. To my full potential.&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh merely looked up at him, like a statue. Only two things on him moved; his head as the fiend lowered himself to the ground and the flames that seemed to surge off him. <BR> <BR>&#34;NOW!&#34; De&#39;spyre screamed as two footprints formed in the ground under him. Roketh always thought Jokers didn&#39;t have feet, like a Gali, but this particular Joker was full of surprises. <BR> <BR>At first nothing happened. He merely looked as if he was constipated. Then, he screamed so loud that the entire battlefield shook everything but Roketh. The Joker slung his clinched fists into the air. Now Roketh began to notice the changes. The Joker had indeed sprouted two legs; each had a small Joker mask on the knee. His cloak was now black with purple lighting running across it in all directions. He now had four spikes on his shoulders, two on each. They were in a line across his broad shoulders, the larger ones on the edge. His scythe was now Amethyst, a purple crystal that may not be the strongest substance, but was the perfect element to concentrate the dark powers of a Joker. The mask was almost the same, save two features. His eyes now had a faint, violet glow and he had teeth, a very sinister grin. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, what do you think, Dragon?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well,&#34; Roketh said heavily, &#34;I still think your gonna die.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Over confident, eh?&#34; The Joker laughed crazily, &#34;You don&#39;t stand a chance against something as strong as me!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Me overconfident?&#34; Roketh mocked, &#34;Isn&#39;t that the pot calling the kettle black!&#34; <BR> <BR>The Joker was enraged. He charged at the Dragon with his new strength, his ultimate strength. Roketh finally moved, and he was flying strait towards the Joker. <BR> <BR>When they met, De&#39;spyre brought his scythe down as hard as he could. Roketh manifested Azurian&#39;s scythe just in time to block the attack. <BR> <BR>&#34;It…can&#39;t…be…!&#34; De&#39;spyre sputtered as his scythe was being pushed back by Roketh&#39;s. Not so much that it was being pushed back as the fact that Roketh only had one hand on it pushing upwards. <BR> <BR>Roketh&#39;s free hand began to glow, his piercing eyes fixated on the Joker. The fire had left his gaze, and formed in his hand, &#34;You do realize I can combine any elements I choose into an attack, and you can&#39;t win.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You…lie…beast!&#34; De&#39;spyre fought still. <BR> <BR>Then, a huge rocky fist grabbed him from behind. De&#39;spyre was lifted into the air by a hand that came out of the very ground. <BR> <BR>&#34;How…did…you?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;When I combined with Grendel, then Blazemost, I gained more of an understanding of my power. Exactly what I can do with it.&#34; Roketh turned to walk away. He took a few steps before De&#39;spyre screamed at him, &#34;What are you doing?&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh turned, then hovered a short ways into the air, &#34;The elements speak to me. I know about the geography of this place,&#34; Then, several rocky fists emerged and stood strait up, as if to beat the ground. <BR> <BR>&#34;W-what?&#34; De&#39;spyre stuttered a bit. <BR> <BR>&#34;It is really quite simple. With a combination of Earth and Fire knowledge, I know how far down the Lava is,&#34; Roketh grinned slightly as he said, &#34;it ain&#39;t far.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;N-no. These craters would&#39;ve have reached it already.&#34; The Joker struggled wildly with his stone confines. <BR> <BR>&#34;My friend, I&#39;m not going to pound my way that far down,&#34; Roketh said with a quiet smile, &#34;I&#39;m merely setting off the volcano. <BR> <BR>With that, Roketh took flight. De&#39;spyre screamed at him. He stopped shortly however; a slight rumbling caught his attention. It got bigger and bigger, finally a crack appeared with lava flowing from it like blood. He knew it was near the surface, but it would merely ooze out and slide down the other side of the volcano. Then he had the sickening remembrance of the giant, stone hands. As he looked at them, they began pounding the grounding, cracking it open wider. He glanced around him for a way out, but then it hit him. Those hands, they were surrounding the hand he was in. <BR> <BR>&#34;NOOO!&#34; He screamed as the earth cracked around him. The stone hand began to fall through. Before he knew it, the hand was plummeting into the heart of the volcano. <BR> <BR>Roketh was gliding away slowly. He could hear his screams, even from his distance, and decided to end his suffering. Even if he didn&#39;t deserve a quick death, Roketh would rather not be like him. With a snap of his fingers, the entire volcano erupted. After years of dormancy, its fiery contents shot skyward in a beautiful display of fire and earth debris. <BR> <BR>&#34;One more.&#34; Roketh thought to himself. <BR> <BR>Meanwhile…in the lair of Kronock… <BR> <BR>Kronock sat silent. All his allies, assassins, henchmen, and plans, all dead. He was alone now, yet he laughed hysterically. He had come to a realization of the other Lord&#39;s identity, and was filled with glee. His smile and voice were the only things to pierce the night. <BR> <BR>&#34;No one can stop me now…no one can ever hope…&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Stay Tuned CHB

 Nice CHB. ;&#41; And I love this quote for some reason. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, what do you think, Dragon?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Well,&#34; Roketh said heavily, &#34;I still think your gonna die.&#34;
