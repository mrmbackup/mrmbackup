<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:Glow_Heartfield@yahoo.com>Gambling Series</A></B> on <B>Wednesday, September 1, 2004 - 12:33 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 Casino, third monster in Elisha&#39;s famous &#39;Gambling series&#39;, flew around cheerfully. The three year old dragon was just past his prime but was still very skilled in battling. Just recently, he had handed Gadamon&#39;s monster back to her cheerfully, bite marks covering the odd creature. He was strong, fast, and, as Elisha constantly told him, the most beautiful &#39;widdle bitty dwagon&#39; she&#39;d ever laid her eyes on. <BR> <BR>Fleria frowned as a man walked down the path to their ranch. With a rather large nose and all around odd features, he wasn&#39;t that hard to notice. Frowning, he looked at Fleria first, then Casino, then to Elisha, who was happily making snow angels. <BR> <BR>&#34;You&#39;re Fleria?&#34; He asked. She nodded, and he looked at Elisha, who was making another snow angel. Casino snuck up behind the first one and added a tail and horns to it. &#34;That child is Elisha?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Fleria looked annoyed. <BR> <BR>&#34;How could you beat my modified monster?&#34; He scowled. Fleria&#39;s eyebrows raised, and Elisha looked over. <BR> <BR>&#34;That must mean..!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes! I am Nazhe.&#34; He cackled. &#34;Now, you will face the power of my monster!&#34; A large, black, somewhat humanoid monster flew down and landed near Casino, destroying the first horned snow angel. Casino looked at his creation, now completly ruined. His nose wrinkled up in a snarl and he launched himself at the &#39;Zan&#39; monster. <BR> <BR>The battle started out with Elisha&#39;s usual strategy: Bite the opponent until it falls down. Casino happily complied, landing one bite on Zan. It took away half of the creature&#39;s strength. After the first bite, though, he was unable to land another hit. <BR> <BR>As the battle went past, Elisha began to squirm. Just as Zan was launching an attack, she screamed as loud as she could: &#34;Stop!&#34; Zan, Fleria, Casino, and Nazhe all looked at her in surpise. Breeders only called for the battle to stop when they wanted to forfit. Nazhe smiled and waited for her to admit her defeat. &#34;Hold on, just a minute!&#34; She gasped, then waddled off. <BR> <BR>Comprehension dawned first in Casino&#39;s eyes. He closed them, sighed, and pinched the bridge of his nose. He then shot an annoyed look at Fleria, who sighed and shook her head. Elisha came back a few moments later, looking much more comfortable. <BR> <BR>&#34;Okay! Start again!&#34; Casino quickly turned to Zan and bit him as hard as he could manage. The black monster fell down, and Casino stood on him, howling with victory. Elisha shoved both of her arms into the air, holding up only her fore finger and pinky finger, then shouted the word: &#34;Woot!&#34; as loud as she could. Then she and Casino both started to dance in circles while she sang: &#39;Potty Break wins the match! Potty Break wins the match!&#39;. Casino gargled along with her. <BR> <BR>Comments welcomend. ^^ Inspired by a recent potty break in the middle of my Zan battle.

 How...Odd. It is almost as if it made sense, until you start to type. Then you lost me. I found it again after Nazhe showed up. I think it could be better, but not bad.
