 Tsapkiro stepped confidently out onto the field. He heard sand crunching under his metal boots. He inspected his surroundings. It was a giant circle of sand, with obstacles such as trees, boulders, and rivers running through it. He strained to hear the announcer over the artificial forest sounds. <BR> <BR>Had the bell rung yet? He thought he heard a distant voice say &#34;3..2..1..start!&#34; He started to clmb the nearest tree to get a better view. Suddenly, a sudden flash of light caught his eye. He dodged just in time as a young, but powerful naga sliced through the tree he had just been on. <BR> <BR>Tsapkiro landed on his feet. How much time was left in the battle? Not much was his guess. He had to hit the naga before time ran out. He used the most accurate move he had. <BR> <BR>&#34;Darkness Fireball!&#34; Tspakiro screamed out his soulmate tech as Darkness flew by him in a giant fireball and crashed into the naga, knocking it unconcious. <BR> <BR>Now that his tech and the naga had pretty much decimated the tress around him, he could hear the announcer pretty clearly. &#34;And the winner is Tsapkiro!&#34; <BR> <BR>The rocky Durahan sat on a boulder and awaited his next battle. By the sound of happy screaming coming from the next coliseum, it wouldn&#39;t be long. Then he heard the next annoucement. &#34;Next up, it will be the Durahan Tsapkiro against Panic, the Lesione! <BR> <BR>The ground suddenly shifted under Tspakiro&#39;s feet. He bounded back into the fighter&#39;s box just as the entire fighting arena dissapeared and was replaced by a sea of water. Six Islands connected to the bottom of the arena floated around. Tsapkiro jumped back into the arena and waded to a floating island. The bell sounded. <BR> <BR>The first warning was a small bubble. There was no second. A giant Lesione burst forth and slammed into the diminuitive&#40;compared to the Lesione&#41; Durahan. Tsapkiro slammed into the side of the arena and then slid into the water. The Lesione swam in circles and laughed playfully. Its trainer was yelling something at the judges. Why wasn&#39;t the fight over? <BR> <BR>Then the Lesione felt it. A warm, then hot, then suddenly BURNING sensation filled its thoughts as boiling water scalded all parts of it that were in the water. The giant mammal bobbed up and down like a dumpling, then sank to the bottom of the arena. The water imediately stopped boiling. <BR> <BR>As water drained away, A small cone of fire was seen pulsing inside the arena. Beside it was the unconcious Lesione.  <BR> <BR>A whisper went through the crowd. &#34;What is that move? I&#39;ve never seen anything like it..&#34; <BR> <BR>As Tsapkiro became visible the audience gasped. The Durahan was holding his sword up in the air and using Aura slash and gaea sword at the same time. This resulted in a protective cone of fire around the user, and an offensive swirl of fire going wherever the sword was pointed. The look of the attack was like an hourglass of fire. <BR> <BR>Tsapkiro waited for the arena to rise, then handed the Lesione over to the doctors. Just one more battle to go. <BR> <BR>Because the naga and lesione had both been knocked unconcious, Tspakiro didn;t have to wait for the next one. Immediately after the ambulance whisked both monsters away, a giant...suzurin? entered the arena. <BR> <BR>The rocky Durahan gasped in awe as the audience clapped. The announcer started her speech once more. And here in our ring is the crowd favorite for D class, SUZYBEE!!!The crowd went wild. The bell rang. <BR> <BR>Tspakiro knew that this monster would be a threat. Even though it was D class, he sensed that this monster was way more powerful. Perhaps Master rank standard. Who had raised this? <BR> <BR>He didn;t have any more time to think. The suzurin flew forward and whacked him with a giant bell. The Durahan flew into the bleachers, clearing the stands to the last few rows. Evidently the crowd had experience with this monster.  <BR> <BR>Tsapkiro rushed forward. Drawing on his inner monol powers, he sent three powerful beams flying toward his enemy. The suzurin simply knocked it away. However, the distraction was all the Durahan wanted. As the suzurin focused on the blast, his speed suddenly increased ten fold. Just as he was about to pass the suzurin, he drew out his sword and held it out on the side facing the suzurin. He felt himself giong past the giant..yes! be felt his sword bite. <BR> <BR>He then felt a curious feeling. One of exhiliration, because he heard the giant monster cry out. A feeling of fear as his sword was yanked from his hand, embedded deep into the suzurins side. And a feeling of pain, when the suzurin suddenly pulled out a giant cannon, placed it in his face, and pulled the trigger. <BR> <BR>Tspakiro was blasted into the wall, then kept going. Finally, the blast stopped. He stepped out from his little cave in the wall. <BR> <BR>The suzurin frowned. Why wasn&#39;t this Durahan as hurt as he was supposed to be? He should be  dead! Master say dead! <BR> <BR>The suzurin stomped towards the durahan/monol. It reached out. <BR> <BR>And then it couldn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>It looked on in horror as the Durahan pushed his limits. Straining with all his might, the Lord of Defense Pushed his shield straight through the Suzurins stomach. Yanking his sword back out, he took satisfaction in seeing the giant&#39;s guts. He then proceeded to spit on the mutant monster.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Go To &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#34; <BR> <BR>With those parting words, he kicked the suzurin&#39;s head off. <BR> <BR> <BR>-little short again, but sorry :/
