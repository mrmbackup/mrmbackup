 Here it comes, Chap 2! I hate to say it, but for now i&#39;m prolly gonna take a long break fom MDA to build this story. I mean, its turning out so good. Any way, I hope you enjoy it! <BR> <BR>Open Wounds Chap 2: Jela <BR> <BR>Everything rushed by as Aikuchi drove across the plains. The wind stung the scratches across my face unmercifully, but I didn’t care. Aurora was hungry, and I had only purchased provisions for one man. Last night, Aurora ate what was to be my breakfast before I passed into Tetsukama. The small farm town was known for its suppliers of food for Aurora and I, and corn meal for Aikuchi. However, it would be over my normal budget, and we’d need some income. <BR> <BR>“Are you really going to pay for me?” Aurora was still amazed I would sacrifice so much for her, “I mean you could just drop me off in the next town.” <BR> <BR>“Aurora, think about what you’re saying,” I began, “Even though Tetsukama is a farm village, the ranchers are not very friendly. They only care about money, and that’s why we’re safe. As long as we pay, we’re safe. If I left you there, with no money, you probably wouldn’t live to see tomorrow.” <BR> <BR>I had obviously frightened her, fore she stayed silent for the rest of the morning. As Aikuchi tore across the plains, I knew we might be in trouble. I hadn’t told Aurora that after I paid for both of us for three weeks, we’d have no money. We needed income, and we needed it fast. Then it hit me, I looked down at the knapsack. <BR> <BR>“Monster Battle,” I muttered. <BR> <BR>“What’d you just say?” Aurora was confused at the totally random remark. I pointed towards the Saucer Stone. <BR> <BR>“There’s our money. With a monster, you could participate in the Monster Battle. You’re monster would become very strong, and we could pay for provisions without ever worrying about going bankrupt.” <BR> <BR>Aurora lit up like a Christmas tree. Her frown exploded into a big grin. <BR> <BR>“You mean me…I,” she was so excited, “I can be a monster breeder?” <BR> <BR>“It would be in our best interest,” I explained, “First, you could fulfill your dream. Second, we will make enough money to buy provisions, or, even better weaponry. Third, having a monster around will be good protection. The only real reliable defense against a wild monster is another monster.” <BR> <BR>As Aikuchi bolted across the countryside, I could see a funnel of smoke rising form the horizon. <BR> <BR>“What is that?” Aurora asked. <BR> <BR>“That would be Tetsukama,” I said cheerfully, “It’s a manufacturing…What is that?!” <BR> <BR>Outside the town walls stood two buildings. One was a low building, with only one floor. It had a symbol on it I could hardly make out, but Aurora could see it. <BR> <BR>“It looks like a dragon, breathing fire,” she said, “And there are three letters under it. It says, um…” she had trouble reading from such a distance, “They are…I…I think next is an M…and an A. Drake, what does IMA mean?” <BR> <BR>I lit up at the sight of the local IMA headquarters. The International Monster Association, or the IMA, was the league one had to join to participate in official tournaments. Next to the IMA, was a building similar to a church. Its huge spires and stained glass windows gave off a religious type of feeling. <BR> <BR>“Why would they put a church next to an Association building?” I asked Aurora. <BR> <BR>Just then, a boy walked up to the front of the church. He had blonde hair, and green eyes. He carried a backpack, and wore traveling clothes. He knocked on the door of the church, and a woman in a blue robe came out. She asked for his breeder license,  and when he showed it to her, he pulled out a Saucer Stone. She took it, and headed back into the church. <BR> <BR>It took a good two minutes for something to happen. Then, the sky darkened and the church lit up. A blinding light shoot forth from the middle spire, and the sound of an explosion came from within the church. Then, the sky brightened, the noise stopped, and the birds began chirping. <BR> <BR>“What just happened here?” I thought. <BR> <BR>The blue robed woman came back out, but something was different. She no longer had the Saucer Stone, but a small yellow ball. It opened an eye and stood up on its one leg. <BR> <BR>“A Suezo,” I whispered. <BR> <BR>The woman handed the Suezo to the boy, and he was pleased. She gave him back his license, and he began home with his monster. <BR> <BR>“What’s up with that church?” I asked. <BR> <BR>Aurora looked excited. Her eyes widened, and she looked up at me. <BR> <BR>“That’s no church,” she began, “That’s a shrine!” <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>“Registration’s all complete!” said the man behind the desk as he handed Aurora a small I. D. But then, he handed her a second. I had no idea why, who was the second breeder? <BR> <BR>“This is for you,” she said, extending her arm with the other I. D. in it, “You are a breeder too now.” <BR> <BR>“Why?” I asked, “I can’t be a breeder, I don’t have a Saucer Stone.” <BR> <BR>“Not true,” said the man behind the counter, “Saucer Stones are everywhere. Our policy is that everyone gets a license when they come in this room. You may not know this, but the Saucer Stones were hidden across the continent in trees, underground, in ruins, and anywhere else you can think. You may not have one now, but everyone comes across at least five Saucer Stones in their lifetime.” <BR> <BR>“Alright then,” I said, “I guess I have no choice.” <BR> <BR>I extended my hand and took the license. <BR> <BR>“Oh, and by the way,” said the man, “As an added bonus, we give each new breeder who doesn’t already have one a Saucer Stone.” <BR> <BR>He reached under the desk, took out a package, and slid it across the table. I picked it up, and opened it. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Inside laid a Saucer Stone. I put my hands inside the box, and picked it up. <BR> <BR>“Thank you,” I said, and Aurora and I walked out. <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>“May I see your licenses,” asked Veara, the woman in the blue robe. <BR> <BR>Both Aurora and I presented our licenses, and then our Saucer Stones. <BR> <BR>“Okay,” she said, “This one is for you,” she pointed at Aurora and then to the disc in her left hand, “And this one is your,” she pointed to me and her right hand.” <BR> <BR>She walked inside, and suddenly the same exact thing happened as before. Moments later it happened again. Soon Veara came out with two monsters. <BR> <BR>“Congratulations Aurora and Drake.” <BR> <BR>“How do you know our names?” I was curious. <BR> <BR>“Well, company policy, I do read the licenses,” she responded sarcastically, “This one is for you,” she walked over to Aurora with a small pink monster. She opened her arms to reveal and Ogyo. Its small pink body was not normal size, and it made little “peep” sounds, it couldn’t talk. <BR> <BR>“Is there something wrong with it?” I asked. <BR> <BR>“Nope,” said Veara, “It’s only a baby. It will grow to full size in about a week, and will be able to talk tomorrow afternoon.” <BR> <BR>Aurora took the tiny pink monster. It resembled a fish, and had a yellow curl on each side of its head. They were relatively short for an Ogyo, but I knew they would grow, as it was only a baby. <BR> <BR>“And for you, Mr. Drake,” Veara came over with a tiny brown ball in her hands. However, before I could hold it, the little thing jumped from Veara’s hands. She gasped, as it unfurled into a Folkes, a breed of Ripper &#40;Ripper/Hare&#41;. It had a brown body, with a thick patch of dark brown fur on its breast. Its long, brown tail was its main feature. <BR> <BR>“Eww,” it made a tiny little squeaking noise, it obviously couldn’t talk yet. <BR> <BR>It looked up at me, with slanted, dark eyes. It looked evil, and Veara saw me and it. <BR> <BR>“Don’t worry about that,” she said, “All Rippers have eyes like that. There’s nothing they can do. Evil eyes are a characteristic property of the Rippers. Well, you both need to name your new monsters, and I have to take them down in the IMA archives. So, what’s it gonna be?” <BR> <BR>“Mine is Celeste,” said Aurora as she twirled the Ogyo around like a new toy. However, it enjoyed it, and let out little “peeps” of happiness. <BR> <BR>“Hmmm…” <BR> <BR>I had no idea what to name my Folkes. I had named my horse, Aikuchi, after a Japanese knife, but what to name this little guy? Then, I thought of another weapon. <BR> <BR>“Jitte,” I muttered, “You’re name is Jitte.” <BR> <BR>The Folkes jumped up and down, it liked its name, but in its joy it tripped over its long tail. I picked it up. <BR> <BR>“So you’re okay with the name Jitte?” I asked. <BR> <BR>It looked up with those eyes. But this time, something was different. I saw a hint of innocence in the bowels of those black eyes. <BR> <BR>“Okay,” said Veara, “They are Celeste and Jitte. Okay, you’re all done. Good luck, and good ranching.” <BR> <BR>With that, Veara walked into the shrine, and we walked out to meet Aikuchi in the fields. We were all pretty hungry, and we tuned to face Tetsukama. We rode towards it. <BR> <BR>&#42;		&#42;		&#42; <BR> <BR>“That was delicious,” I said. <BR> <BR>Jitte and Celeste “peeped” in agreement. <BR> <BR>“That was the best meal I ever had, thank you, Drake,” said Aurora in appreciation. <BR> <BR>After that, I paid the bill and we stepped out of the small café. As we walked along the market area in Tetsukama, I purchased vegetables such as carrots, celery, corn, and some radish. As we walked in front of the butcher’s shop, Jitte tugged at my pants, and pointed to the door. It always sneered when we bought veggies. <BR> <BR>“I get it,” I said to it, “You’re a strictly meat only kinda guy.” <BR> <BR>Jitte nodded his head up and down. I pushed open the door, greeted the butcher, and bought some salted pork, venison, chicken, and beef. Jitte seemed very pleased. I looked around, and saw a small race horse. <BR> <BR>“Excuse me, sir,” I said to the man, “How much for that horse?” <BR> <BR>“It’s free, with saddle and feed,” he said. <BR> <BR>“What?!” I was alarmed. It had to be my lucky day. Now Aurora could have her own horse.  <BR> <BR>“But why for free?” I asked. <BR> <BR>“My stable is full, and I can’t house another horse. I have to get rid of him,” he said. <BR> <BR>I accepted the horse, and took it through town. I noticed two very large saddle bags in one of the stores. I approached the store owner. <BR> <BR>“How much are those?” I pointed to the bags. <BR> <BR>“They are twenty five dollars a piece,” he responded. <BR> <BR>“Oh man,” I sighed, “I don’t have enough money. I had a great idea too. If we hang those from the horses, we’d be able to carry Celeste and Jitte. If only we had fifty…” <BR> <BR>“Fifty Dollar Prize! Come one come all to the IMA infant challenge!” <BR> <BR>I shot my head around and heard the noise come from the coliseum in the center of town. I picked up Jitte, and took the two horses to the stadium. I was sure Aurora would be alright, she had some money and was walking around the stores. <BR> “All monsters fewer than one week old are eligible. Come test your new partner’s skills and earn fifty dollars in the process!” <BR> <BR>I took Jitte to the reception desk. I put my name in, and a man told me to proceed to the stadium. I heard only a limited crowd cheering. The infants were the lowest of the low in terms of fights. However, they were cheap, so some families came to show their children minor league type battles. There were only two monsters signed up. Jitte, and a monster named Jela, were the two infants fighting for the fifty dollars. <BR> <BR>The man came out, and beckoned Jitte and I out into the open. The crowd cheered as another pair entered the stadium as well. I couldn’t believe it. It was the same blonde boy with that Suezo. He had named his Suezo, Jela. The announcer stepped forward. <BR> <BR>“Good afternoon Monster Battle fans!” he screamed, “Today, I give you a battle of monsters fresh from the disc. Both of them were unlocked today here in Tetsukama!” <BR> <BR>The crowd cheered very loud. <BR> <BR>“In this corner, I give you Drake, and his Folkes, Jitte.” <BR> <BR>The crowd cheered as Jitte sprang into the air and then onto the tiles in the middle of the stadium. <BR> <BR>“And in this corner,” the announcer pointed towards the boy and his Suezo, “We have Charles and his Suezo, Jela!” <BR> <BR>Jela rolled onto the tiles as the crowd cheered. <BR> <BR>“DING! DING!” <BR> <BR>The bell rang and the fight was on… <BR> <BR> <BR>Next Chap coming soon. Hope you enjoyed it! -Icelord13
