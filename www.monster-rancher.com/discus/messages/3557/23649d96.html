 Chapter 20:Reflection <BR> <BR>&#40;Ok, I&#39;m giving the story a bit of a push forward so bear with me. This one is purely a plot developer. There will probably be no more then 5 or 6 chapters left to the story. Trust me, it&#39;s total carnage from here on in!&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;It&#39;s come down to this.....&#34; <BR> <BR>Justice the durahan stood beside the helm of the ship which bore them across the sea, staring idly out onto the blue water. It was 24 hours since they were rescued from the clutches of the master by Raa-zor and brought back to Moo&#39;s fortress. Now he stood on a boat, bearing closer and closer to the Masters base to begin the final battle.... <BR> <BR>The warrior walked outside and felt the wind, cool and fierce as it filled the sails...Alot had happened yesterday, so much so fast, he had to search his memory to remember exactly how he came to this point. The zyoth spoke little of what they faced, saying only that it was nearly impossible to defeat. They did say that the master would retreat to an island and gave the location. It was then that Raa-zor made the shocking statement...If the master was not dead in three days the zyoth would activate a weapon that would destroy the entire world. Not only did they have the master and his minions to contend with but know they were on a strict time limit, one day had past and they were well into the second. Time was indeed of the essence... <BR> <BR>After hearing this a plan was hastily laid down. Moo&#39;s forces on this continent were totally decimated and the Fortress was grounded because of extensive internal damage. They had one slim chance for victory, a small group had to infiltrate the masters base and destroy him once and for all. Justice and Moo had no choice but to join forces once again. They had an interesting discussion...  <BR> <BR>~Flashback~ <BR>~&#34;No,&#34;Justice said, stepping fearlessly before the great Moo. &#34;You&#39;ll just turn on us as soon as the danger has past! Then we&#39;ll have traded one tyrant for another. I want your word that you will leave this land in piece if we help you.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You dare make demands to me!?&#34;Moo roared, bearing down of the smaller durahan. <BR> <BR>&#34;Moo, you can&#39;t defeat the master alone. You have no time to get reinforcements, You need us as much as we need you.&#34;Justice said.&#34;Now promise!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;.....One year,&#34;Moo said after a long moment of ominous silence. &#34;I will give one year, but no more.&#34;~ <BR> <BR>Justice had no choice but to except that, Moo wasn&#39;t giving anymore slack dispite all that was on the line. One year would hopefully be enough time to prepare for his next invasion...Afterward they&#39;d gotten together what remained of Justice&#39;s army in Torlormec and &#39;borrowed&#39; a few ships. Now they sailed southeast, for the fight of their lives... <BR> <BR>&#34;Sir!&#34;The Zuum Begras approached. He&#39;d taken command after the arrival of Moo and had waited patiently for justice to return. &#34;Everything&#39;s in order below.....is this really it?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes my friend...this is it.&#34;Justice replied, never shifting his gaze from the horizon. &#34;All the lives that have been lost in this struggle...this is our chance to finally seek revenge.&#34; He bowed his head, memories of his beloved trainer flooding his mind.... <BR> <BR> <BR>Shielka awoke with a start after another of her nightmares. It frightened her even more to awaken on the ship and it took a few minutes for the events of the last few days to return to her. Just three days ago she was the Masters second in command, now shielka was on a ship bound to confront him....The Daina stood up and yawned, stretching her wings to their fullest. Her wounds had been healed by the zyoth, some weird potion they gave her. She didn&#39;t pretend to understand how it worked, but at least they were all ready for the battle ahead, physically at least. <BR> <BR>Still rubbing the sleep from her eyes the daina walked out into the mid-day sun. Monsters, members of justice&#39;s army, patrolled the deck and carried out their personal duties. Shielka felt strangely out of place amongst them, an outsider. Not long ago she&#39;d defend the master with her life, she&#39;d be fighting them with all her power. The entire situation made the daina uneasy. Then she spotted StoneClaw leaning over the side of the ship, staring at the water and approached... <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m not sea sick, in case your wonderin...&#34;Claw blurted out, startling the daina who didn&#39;t know he sensed her presence. The trident never turned around, looking down into the blue abyss. <BR> <BR>&#34;What are you doing then?&#34;She asked inquisitively, standing next to him and looking over the side. <BR> <BR>&#34;Just thinkin....&#34;The Trident replied, his talon scraping against the wood idly. &#34;I&#39;m trying to decide what I&#39;m gonna do when this is over with....What about you? You have anything to go back to after you&#39;ve had your revenge?&#34; <BR> <BR>Shielka fell silent for a long time, in truth she hadn&#39;t given the question much thought. If anyone else had asked her they probably would have received no reply. But the daina felt she could trust the trident, if no one else... &#34;I&#39;m not really sure...I have no family, no home...nothing. All I have is this moment, this fight. I still hate humans, and Moo, but right now I hate the Master more. Him and those....&#34;Her voice trailed off at the thought of her &#39;friends&#39;. How could she trust anyone after what they did to her? They were ready to kill her without hesitation upon command. The thought infuriated Shielka as much as it saddened her and it took alot of effort to hold back her own bitter tears. <BR> <BR>Stone claw raised his head and turned to her, seeing that the daina had suddenly become withdrawn. He saw the pain in her eyes but didn&#39;t know how to comfort her, he wondered why he wanted too...Finally he turned back to the sea and spoke. &#34;Hell, I wish there was something I could do to help. It hurts being betrayed, and revenge won&#39;t really make that pain go away....but it&#39;ll still be fun pullin Zarzaas&#39;s head off.&#34; The trident grins and looks back at her. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;d rather strangle him with his own tail...&#34;The Daina replied, surprised that she accutally felt alittle better. &#34;And Talus...whatever should we do to him?&#34; Stone claw hissed out a cold laugh. The two monsters spent some time discussing weather to melt him down or to have him slowly crushed in the trash compactor....  <BR> <BR> <BR>Ganthor sat on the deck, taking up much of the third ships space. Fortunately it had the least crew and so his mammoth size was not a problem...except for the fact that his sheer weight had them trailing behind the other ships. As he sat there his thoughts drifted to the trainer he&#39;d left behind in Torlormec. He had a chance to see him during the brief visit to the city, and promised that no matter what the stronghorn would return alive. Ganthor wasn&#39;t so sure he&#39;d be able to keep his promise...Celine fluttered up to him, noting the worried look on his face. <BR> <BR>&#34;Sea sick?&#34;She asked,&#34;You don&#39;t look to well. Don&#39;t be ashamed, it&#39;s my first time on a boat as well. Riding on water is so different the flying or walking.....Ganthor.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We&#39;re gonna die!&#34;The stronghorn screamed out.&#34;I had a promising career goin before all this Man! Why did I come along anyway, what was I thinking!?&#34; <BR> <BR>Beatdown hopped up to Ganthor and looked up at him with her big brown eyes. &#34;You know..for someone big as you, you sure are a wuss.&#34; Celine giggled when Beatdown said that, it sounded cute coming from the little fairyhare. <BR> <BR>&#34;You don&#39;t understand....&#34;Ganthor began but Beatdown scrambled up onto his shoulder. &#34;I&#39;m not that good a fighter. I only got to A rank because I was lucky and got to accutally hit my opponent because of some unseen force. It was like there were two percent gauges and mine was- <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you feeling well??&#34;Celine flew up to him and placed her hand on his brow. &#34;You don&#39;t feel feverish.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey! Let me finish!&#34;the Stronghorn yelled. &#34;It was like there were two percent gauges and mine was really low...but thanks to the strange unseen force I got hits on faster opponents! It was bizarre! And have you ever felt, in the heat of combat that you were being manipulated? You know, Urging you to move forward or back and tellin ya what attacks to use?&#34; Beatdown and Celine exchanged glances and looked at Ganthor like he was insane...... <BR> <BR> <BR>~Meanwhile.....~ <BR> <BR>Deep within the Master&#39;s dark chamber his warriors assembled. They had returned to the island, as the evil one had intended too do. The humans had been driven away and slaughtered like cattle, the island was theirs. The Black Raven had completed it&#39;s transformation to stationary mode and now stood as a great ebon tower. They had been forced to withdraw last time, but now the Master was in control once again. His flagship was fully repaired and the primary weapon back on-line and standing by... <BR> <BR>&#34;Status report Talus!&#34;The Masters voice sounded of a mixture of anger and annoyance and they all felt the wrath of his moods... <BR> <BR>&#34;The primary weapon is operational, conversion to stationary mode is complete...All systems ready.&#34;Talus retorted.&#34;When the powercell recharges we shall begin bombardment of the continent using the weapon at full power! In exactly...&#34;Grinding noises echoed from the Gaia processor.&#34;Two hours and fifty-seven seconds all who oppose you will be purged from the land.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Excellent...Vor,&#34;The Master commanded. &#34;What about the defensive line?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;My Master,&#34;The Lorica stepped forward and bowed low. &#34;The defensive perimeter is up, I&#39;ve assigned Darklon to this task. You have my word lord, nothing will come within a fifty yards of this base...without getting vaporized that is.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Make sure of it my second.&#34;The Master said and it was like music to Vor&#39;s ears. He&#39;d waited so long to be the masters second in command and now with Shielka no longer a factor, he was.&#34;Now go forth, my warriors...and serve your master!&#34;  <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Justice!&#34;Begras cried as the island came into view at last as the crimson orb of the sun began to set in the distance, filling the sky with brilliant orange and red. The Durahan looked up and drew his sword, the sea becoming choppy as they steadily approached. The sky was darkened by patrols of airborne minions in the distance...He knew this would be the greatest battle of his life, one that would probably kill him. But Justice had come far, and now he fought not only for the spirit of his trainer but for the entire world, monsters and humans alike. As if all his lifelong training had come down to this...He looked to the zuum beside him. <BR> <BR>&#34;This is it! It&#39;s time to destroy this fiend....once and for all!&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>End of Chapter 20 <BR> <BR>Next time: The island assault begins, but the Master is well prepared. Can they possibly defeat Darklon?? A Jaggernaut that may be more powerful then Moo himself? Find out, next time.....

 total carnage, eh?  well, so be it.  but i enjoyed this chapter, especially the ganthor interlude...no matter how far out the plotline takes you, you find a moment to tie it in to whats familiar to me.  as a reader, i appreciate that.

 Personally, I was amazed by the fact you had something in this story that I&#39;ve never seen in your work....comic relief! As far as the blood, guts, and gore goes, I can do without.....for a while.

 I have to concurr, B.R.!  the plot is, as always, fabulous.  The grammar had few mistakes this time &#40;surprisingly -_^&#41;, and the way you tie things together and manage to hold realism is masterful.  On a side note, this is the first time that I noticed it, but you managed to tie two stories together, from the look of it.  I take it that this is before your other story with Raa-zor?  Anyways, as I have form the beginning, I eagerly await the next installment of &#34;Rise of The Master.&#34;

 Okay, the comment above was meant for chapter 19.  I didn&#39;t get to write it in time. <BR> <BR>I agree that it was a slow chapter, but I actually think it added more depth to the characters.  I mean, you can&#39;t just have hack and slash and expect to make it a success...unless maybe you&#39;re publishing Diablo II, but even it had story &#40;No offense to the game, I actually liked it&#41; ^_^  As for the tongue and cheek humor &#34;have you ever felt, in the heat of combat that you were being manipulated? You know, Urging you to move forward or back and tellin ya what attacks to use?&#34;  Absolute genious to add that line!  I don&#39;t think I saw a single grammatical error, either.  It may have just been filler, but it was good filler. Two thumbs up.
