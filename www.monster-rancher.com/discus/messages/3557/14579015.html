 Chapter 15:Against The Raven <BR> <BR>Never, not once since the day of it&#39;s creation, had the dark fortress been forced to repel such awesome power. The blast came quickly, sudden, giving no time for the massive construct to straft. It took the full impact of the Ravens cry, a name given for the horrible wail that accompanied each attack. Like the song of the bird itself it was a terrible thing to hear, a harbringer of death. Every one of Moo&#39;s soldiers had stopped to stare in horror as the energy beam surged toward them. They&#39;d seen what that power could do, gazed upon the charred remains and broken bodies of their comrades. They had seen entire complexes reduced to piles of rubble, cities dusted off like nothing at all. But this time, by some miracle, the fortress survived and remained airborne, a testament to it&#39;s construction. <BR> <BR>The place shook so hard even the dreaded Moo had trouble standing. Justice fell to his knee&#39;s, feeling shockwaves travel through is metal body. Finally, the shaking stopped and all breathed a sigh of relief. Moo pushed past his minions and looked out at the raven. The machine was hovering, silent as death, seemingly waiting for moo to make the next move. Justice didn&#39;t think the master expected the fortress to survive the cry, nothing had stood up to it&#39;s power until now... <BR> <BR>&#34;Damage?&#34;Moo snarled at the weed who first informed him of the masters arrival. The plant/naga hastily began tapping commands on the console with his branches. After about a minute he spoke: <BR> <BR>&#34;Master Moo, our armor holds, no breaches.&#34;It said nervously&#34;We have however lost the ability to move, it may take an hour to repair but until then we can&#39;t get away!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I have no intention of running away,&#34;Moo said, a hint of sadism in his voice. He&#39;d apparently forgotten all about his three &#39;guests&#39;.&#34;Deploy my Dread Wing squadron, destroy the raven. All others return to your posts...&#34; <BR> <BR>They did as he commanded, neatly filing out of the chamber as the weed spoke into a strange device, issuing instructions that echoed throughout the halls. Only the ones normally stationed remained. A moment later the sky was filled with black dragons. They were coming from within the fortress, flying for all their worth toward the raven. The ebony beasts wore metal armor over their heads and torso, tails tipped with blades. Hundreds of them deployed, converging on Moo&#39;s target, who happened to be grinning. <BR> <BR>&#34;Justice!&#34;Celine said in a harsh wisper. &#34;Lets escape while he&#39;s distracted.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Leaving already? How rude...&#34;Moo heaved his bulk towards her suddenly.&#34;I&#39;m afraid thats impossible, but at least you shall witness the masters death before you share the same fate.&#34; <BR> <BR>Justice fingered his sword, they had to escape. The exits were blocked and guarded, the fortress was filled with moo&#39;s monsters, The evil one himself staring the durahan in the face. He must have been crazy to think Moo would just let them go. Justice turned back to the window, the black cloud of dragons still en route. Moo watched on, a rather confident look on his face, these dread wings must be powerful for him to have so much faith. Indeed, he looked as though he&#39;d already won. <BR> <BR>However, just as the master was unprepared for the defensive strength of the fortress, Moo was hardly ready for what happened next. As the dragons began to bombard the raven with deadly flame, they met resistance of their own. Eight hatches opened along the Ravens backside, and from them sprang a fury of winged death. Hundreds of minions took to the sky, more then twice the number of Moo&#39;s forces. Small and frail yet deadly none the less, the little terrors quickly overwhelmed the dread wings, tearing and rending with bladed limbs. The armor provided some small protection, but not enough as they fell from the sky one by one, crashing to the earth in bloody heaps.  <BR> <BR>&#34;What?? Fire...Fire all weapons!!&#34;Moo roared. Beams of energy began to fire in machine gun succession from the fortresses underside, hitting many minions but having no effect on the raven. <BR> <BR>&#34;Master Moo!&#34;The weed called&#34;Look.&#34; <BR> <BR>Then something else emerged from the Ravens underbelly. An utterly repulsive creature, huge, it had a zilla like body and a head that looked like a Baku&#39;s with all fur burned off. It&#39;s flew on six large wings, the belly was bloated, hiding something within it&#39;s folds. As the battle waged on around them it lumbered by, minions forming a virtual wall to protect it from laser fire or dread wings. It floated right up to the fortress and then, in an act that resembled someone throwing up their lunch, the belly erupted releasing dozens of creatures. Justice noticed they were the same as he&#39;d faced in the swamp, he called them cloaks, for their odvious ability. The cloaks grasped the fortress easily thanks to it&#39;s jagged construction and began drilling through the armor. The lasers were situated on the underside and couldn&#39;t reach them, meanwhile the dread wings were being cut down like nobodies business. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey!&#34;Ganthor pointed upward&#34;They&#39;re comin through the ceiling!&#34; <BR> <BR>Just then Gray wolf reappeared,&#34;Master Moo, A problem has arisen!&#34; <BR> <BR>Moo was not happy to say the least.&#34;Aside from the obvious?&#34; The dragon relied, glancing up at the ceiling. The masters troops were nearly through. <BR> <BR>&#34;We have a serious breach,&#34;Gray Wolf stated&#34;Several enemies have already gotten in and are heading toward the engine room. I sent my pack but they were cut down, these are truly prey of merit.&#34; <BR> <BR>Moo thought for a moment before turning, surprisingly, to Justice. &#34;You three, follow gray wolf and protect the engine core.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Why the hell should we help you? You were just about to kill us!&#34;Celine asked, she seemed to be getting over her fear for a moment. Unfortunately that fear returned quickly enough with a threatening glance from Moo. <BR> <BR>&#34;This fortress doesn&#39;t float by itself,&#34;Moo said&#34;If the core is destroyed, or even damaged badly, we will fall to the earth. Think you can survive that?? Follow gray wolf, stop them, do this and I will spare your lives.&#34; <BR> <BR>What choice did they have? Refuse and die or agreed and pray Moo keeps his word. Justice vowed he get them safely out of this mess, this might be a chance to escape. Gray wolf leading, they charged out of the chamber into the dark, panic filled halls. Never in their wildest dreams did any of them think they&#39;d be trying to save the dreaded flying fortress. Meanwhile Moo waited as the last layer of defense was being drilled away. The weed turned to him from the console suddenly.&#34;Um, Master...&#34; <BR> <BR>The ceiling came down with a crash, minions quickly flooding the chamber. They were mostly cloaks and the flyers but one was different, a true breed. Among them stood a Lilim, she looked up at the dragon, no fear whatsoever in those crazed eyes. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hello Moo,&#34;Jakira laughed&#34;Nothing personal but the Master has ordered you dead, ain&#39;t that a bitch? Alright guys! Kill him!&#34; <BR> <BR>The massive Moo simply grinned, curling a talon toward this legion of death that calmly said &#39;Bring it.&#39;  <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;This way,&#34;The Salamander, Zarzaas hissed at the 6 Hengers at his flank. They weren&#39;t normal breeds, but special battle hengers clad in thick, camouflage armor and with twin machine guns for limbs. They all stood in front of a sealed off passage.&#34;They should be coming through there! Take your positions!&#34; <BR> <BR>The Battle hengers did as they were told and took up firing positions outside the door. Zarzaas smiled, whatever came through that door would be dead instantly, caught in the crossfire of his machines. He waited....nothing, the red lights still flashing overhead. The Salamander began to become impatient, perhaps they had not come this way after all. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hmmmm, You.&#34;He said to the nearest henger&#34;Open the door and check it out.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Roger,&#34;It said in a mechanized voice. He pressed a small button and the door quickly opened. At that moment a surge of Flame erupted from within and fried the henger. Before the others could even aim their weapons a Trident leaped from the fires heart. He stabbed the first henger with his talons, slicing right through the protective armor. A second was struck down by a bolt of Lightening, the electricity cinging it&#39;s hardware. The last two were decked by a little fairy hare before they could open fire. Zarzaas hissing viciously at the enemies of his master before taking off down the hall, vowing to make them pay..... <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah! Take that!&#34;Beatdown cried as she shadow boxed. Shielka shook her head silently before turning her attention toward an escape. The hatches were a long way from the area in which they now stood. Besides, even if they made it, how could get they away unless the Raven landed? The daina glanced at her butchered wing, no way they could fly out... <BR> <BR>&#34;Snap out of it!&#34;Claw grabbed her suddenly&#34;They&#39;re coming back, we are gonna have company real soon.&#34; <BR> <BR>Shielka nodded and pointed westward,&#34;This way!&#34; <BR> <BR>As those words left the daina&#39;s mouth, the door behind them sprang open, an entire legion of Battle Hengers waiting on the other side. The trio took off, Claw and beatdown following Shielka&#39;s lead as the hengers opened fire. The trident stopped suddenly, machine gun fire exploding around him. The bullets, while painful, couldn&#39;t penetrate his hide. Energy began to collect in his palms. The hengers halted in alarm as the Energy shots screamed down the hall towards them. One was hit directly and was destroyed on impact, the second shot hit the wall, the resulting blast knocking the other hengers down. The enemy stalled, claw turned around and continued after his companions. <BR> <BR>Stone claw was pleased when he found them so easily, standing at the end of a narrow hall, a closed door before him. He was not so happy to discover that Shielka couldn&#39;t get the thing open. She was hastily tapping in commands on a small panel next to the door. It didn&#39;t open, nothing worked, the daina was beginning to panic. <BR> <BR>&#34;Come on! Damn it, this door is never closed!&#34;She said, trying another combination. &#34;Someone has locked it by remote and changed the access code, I need a minute, maybe I can break it.&#34; <BR> <BR>Suddenly hengers appeared at the far end of the hall, they readied their machine guns and opened fire, letting loose a stream of hot lead. Almost without thinking, Claw thrust himself between them and the hengers, taking the volley of bullets to his chest. He thought his hard skin could take them easily, but the constant bombardment began to wear him down quickly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hurry, Hurry!!&#34;Beatdown cried to shielka.&#34;Stone claw can take that forever!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m trying! Why won&#39;t thi-&#34;She stopped, as if by magic the door unlocked and opened by itself. Shielka turned, hurling a fireball passed claw and straight into the firing Hengers. The orb exploded, sending mechanical body parts all over as oil smeared the walls.&#34;Get in quick!&#34; <BR> <BR>They did, and the door slammed shut once again, locking. Shielka glanced around, the trio stood in a what looked like a storage chamber. Mountains of supplies and such piled around. This were in the right place, for she knew of a secret passage that Talus once showed her. <BR> <BR>&#34;So far so good.&#34;She said to herself before hearing a loud thump. Fearing the hengers she wirled around, but found it was not the enemy after all. Claw had collapsed, face first on the floor. With beatdown&#39;s help she managed to turn him over, some of the outer stone of his chest had been chipped away, revealing vulnerable gray flesh.&#34;Claw? Can you speak??&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;S-serves me right for tryin to save your sorry asses....&#34;The Trident managed to say. <BR> <BR>&#34;Stone claw!? Please don&#39;t die....&#34;Beatdown whinned&#34;Please....&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;He&#39;ll be fine,&#34;A voice said from the shadows, a voice Shielka knew well. She stood up as a Gaia emerged from the darkness. <BR> <BR>&#34;Talus.....&#34;
