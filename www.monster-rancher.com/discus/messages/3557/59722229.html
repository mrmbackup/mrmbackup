 The lab was situated half a mile into the town and its door had a small swivel sign saying, &#34;combination in progress&#34;.  Inside, the two loading bases were occupied. <BR>   Kain waved goodbye to his two monsters from behind a glass window.  The monsters slowly melted down into light and were slowly absorbed by two electronically charged aerials.  Both monsters had been B class and as the last shimmer of light was absorbed he remembered them. <BR>   The first had been a Garlent, a Hengar with the subtype of a dragon.  It had been trained mostly in power and skill but had an ok defence.  The second of Kain&#39;s monsters was an Arrow Head.  It had been trained in power and defence but also had a little training in life. <BR>   Kain&#39;s eyes reflected the light of two rock seprents fired the light of the monsters.  Bright glowing balls were spiralling and dancing and slowly gathered into the shape of a lobster.  As the light began to fade a bronze pincer forced its way out, a single green eye opened and glowed slightly.  Kain admired its armoured body as a large door opened and the Monster ran out and hugged Kain&#39;s leg.  Dadge walked up slowly and began scanning the monster with what looked like a remote control.   <BR>  &#34;hmm...looks healthy, Its a Renocraft, A main breed Arrowhead, sub breed Hengar.  Likes Fish, Dislikes cup jelly, good natured.&#34; <BR>  Kain nodded his head and smiled at the Renocraft.  <BR>  &#34;I think i&#39;ll call him Bolt.&#34; Declared Kain.  He knealt down to the hight of the Creature,  he smiled as he stared aimelessly at him.   <BR>  &#34;Do you like that name?&#34;   <BR>Bolt punched the air several times and jumped slightly.   <BR>  Bolt proved to get strong quickly,  he was tackling some difficult training methods only 6 months into his life.  One day Kain was watching Bolt tackle the Domino training.  Bolt launched a powerful punch into the first block slab,  it fell and hit the second witch fell into the third, knocking it to the floor in a cloud of dust.  As Bolt began to pick up the fallen slabs Kain thought he heard a noise, he looked around but saw nothing.  Bolt had lined up the dominoes and fired his stinger straight through the center of all three dominoes, they all fell into splintered pebbles.  This time Bolt heard it and raised his head.  He looked both ways and opened his mouth.  Though it was possible for monsters to speak english, it took them along time and many only bothered with simple bits.   <BR>  &#34;noise?&#34; Bolt queeried. <BR>  &#34;Yes i can hear it aswell&#34; <BR>A nearby bush burst open and a purple flash zoomed past them and landed in another patch of greenery.  Bolt had seen it.  He opened his pincers and bent his legs ready to jump.  The bush exploded and bits of leaf went flying.  A man and a monster stood in the shower of fauna.   <BR>   &#34;Ah, so this the trainer Kain and his latest creature.  My name is Kurt and this is Venom&#34;  The man signalled towards his monster.  It was a Purple Hare, a hare with the sub breed of a naga.  It was lightly jumping from foot to foot and launching quick punches into the air.   <BR>  &#34;Why are you here?&#34;  asked Kain watcihng the hare.   <BR>  &#34;Scilence!, you may talk when your creature is dead.  Venom, if you would.&#34; <BR>  The hare rocketed forward at Bolt and just missed, his foot hit the ground and Venom pushed himself into the air.  He came down fists first at great speed.  Bolt stood waiting with his pincers in the air, ready to crush the monster when it landed in one.  It landed in his right pincer and Bolt snapped it shut, he wasn&#39;t fast enough and Venom had allready landed in his left pincer.  Bolt clamped his left pinser shut and found Venom on the ground infront of him.  He swang a claw at the purple hare but it jumped straight over the top and launched two quick punches at Bolt&#39;s face.  Bolt knew if he could only get a hold of Venom for long enough thne he could probably beat it but the hare was just two fast.  He continued to launch attacks at Bolt, until Bolt got a lucky hit, he swang his claw sidewards and hit Venom straight into his waiting pincer.  It snapped shut and started crushing Venom.  Squeks of pain came from the little rabbit but Kurt showed no sign of surrender.  Bolt ducked and held Venoms body high in the air.   There was a flash as Bolt&#39;s sting fired threw the Hares flesh and returned back to normal size.  Bolt dropped the Ko&#39;d Venom to the floor and turned to face Kurt.  Kurt looked up at the Renocraft and down at his monster.  Kain smiled slightly, <BR>  &#34;Now Mr. Kurt if I were you I&#39;d be very careful not to upset Bolt.  He gets very angry, as do I.&#34;  Kain drew a sword from a holster around his waist.  &#34;Now any little clue will do, Anything.&#34;   <BR>  Kurt looked around desperately then handed Kain a small piece of paper.  He picked up Venom then ran threw the bushes.  Kain stared downat the piece of paper.  It had an octogon on it.  The octogon had been split into eight coloured pieces but the pieces were just shaded in in pencil.  Bolt looked up to Kain and thought for a few seconds, <BR>  &#34;Master, you would sword hurt him?&#34;  Bolt seemed to struggle through the words. <BR>  &#34;No Bolt, I wouldn&#39;t have sword hurted him.&#34; <BR> <BR>  It was two weeks later that the message came.  Kain had been throwing a lump of boned meat to Bolts mouth when he saw a blast of flames in the sky.  A phoenix shot down towards Kain and Bolt and they both jumped as it landed perfectly about two metres away from them.  The phoenix was wearing a gold helmet and had gold protectors on its legs.  It squawked a few times then dropped a letter to the ground.  It waited expectantly as Kain picked up the paper.  It had writing on it. <BR>  <BR>  &#34;You are invited to join the First anual Four match.  Four powerful trainers from around the continent have been selected by IMA to compete in the Four Match battle with Fimba.  Three other trainers have been selected and you must meet at the Lab in Lindas in three days time.  Please place this letter in the Phoenix&#39;s beak when finished.&#34; <BR> <BR>Kain placed the paper scroll in the flaming birds sharp beak and it spread its wings and left.  He turned to Bolt, <BR>  &#34;Ok, bolt we are going to Lindas.  We can get a chariot there.&#34; <BR>  &#34;Why we go master?&#34; said Bolt. <BR>  &#34;Your gonna be in a big battle.&#34; <BR>The two travelers walked into the town and looked about for the shop.  It was a large shop with a massive stable next to it.  The sound of hoof prints could be heard from within side.  The chariot shop was the place to go if you needed a fast mode of transport.  People could rent a chariot that would be pulled by a centaur.  After the time had expired, the centaur could return.   <BR>  Bolt and Kain left in a strong red chariot being pulled by a Celious, a Centaur sub breed tiger.  They reached Lindas in only a day and the Centaur turned and head back through the woodland.  Lindas was a packed town, people were all very busy, wheeling barrels around and selling items.  Many monsters were there aswell following their masters.  Kain saw two Hoppers dancing togethor as their trainers talked.  A mew was carrying a book for her master and a kato was drinking from a goblet with his.  So this was Lindas.  Kain payed for an expensive hotel room where he spent the next couple of days lightly training with Bolt.  He wasn&#39;t to excited about all ths just yet.  He wanted to make sure it wasn&#39;t some hoax before he got too excited.  He had even wondered if it was just a ploy to get him off his ranch so that Kurt and Venom could return.  Kain watched as Bolt sped across the 5 star swimming pool.  This would help get his defence up and Renocraft had naturally good stat gains in defence.  The next day he was waiting at the lab before it opened.  Just as the sign on the door was turned to open, a girl walked up. She was quite tall and thin,  her blonde hair slightly covered her face.  She had a monster with her.  Kain couldn&#39;t help thinking that they were bothing thinking the same question.  Finally he asked her.   <BR>  &#34;Escuse me, are you here four the Four Match?&#34;   <BR>  The women looked extremely releived,   <BR>  &#34;well at least i wasn&#39;t the only one.  Hi my names Mia.  This is my salamander, Scissora.&#34; <BR>  The salamander was a zuum, dragon sub type.  It had tiny red wings and long sharp claws.  Its beady yellow eyes scanned Bolt and it walked up and began talking in disciu to Bolt.  The four of them walked in and sat in the waiting room.  A man walked around the corner and smiled at them.   <BR>  &#34;I take it that you are both here for the Four Match.  The other two should be along shortly.&#34;  The man smiled again and left the room.   <BR>  Ten minuits later the other two arrived togethor, they had met outside.  One of the trainers was male, the other was female.  There two monsters was talking happily.  One was a purebreed Tiger and the other was an Angel, a pixie, gali sub breed.  The tiger looked much stronger than the others when it sat next to them but it chattered and wagged its tail.  The man looked at Mia and Kain.   <BR>  &#34;Hello my names Zack, this is my tiger Houndine.  He may look tough but he is very friendly.  This here is Alex.&#34;  He pointed to the girl and she waved politely.  &#34;She is a little shy but she&#39;ll get used to us soon enough,  I ran into her outside and she was hovering around the door like a lost child. Oh and her angel is called Kea&#34;  <BR>  Alex looked around and gigled slightly.  Kain knew she was nervous.  Mia and Kain introduced themselves and their monsters then sat back down in the comfy waiting room chairs.  It was a few minuits later that a man burst through the door accoumpinied by two trumpet players.  The man was old but his fluffy white hair stood out and he smiled as if he was twenty five.  He looked at the trainers and their monsters.   <BR>  &#34;Are you Kain, Alex, Mia and Zack?  Excelent, I am Sam and I am incharge of the Ima side.  Oh I am sorry, let me explain.  From this year onwards Ima and Fimba will meet in a central stadium.  It has been built so it lies half in Fimba and half in IMA.  Each continent will put forward four monsters and they will battle.  Whoever wins the most battkes wins for that year and will get a trophy point.  In the event of a two-two tie, A monster from each team will be randomly selected to fight.&#34; <BR>  The man said all this increadibly fats but all four of them managed to get the words.  He handed them each a piece of paper with a date, the 3rd week of June on it. <BR>  &#34;This is when the tourney will take place.  It is only a week away.  We will pay for you to stay in a hotel and train until then, from there we will take you to the tournement.&#34; <BR>  The man left the room and hoof prints rocketed off into the distance.   <BR>  The monsters were worked hard over the next week.  They were trained solo, in groups and even had mock battles.  Each day the trainers seemed to get more excited.  On the morning of the 3rd week, Bolt and houndine were battling.  Houndine launched a powerful blizzard attack but bolt just avoided it.  Ice sprang up all over the ground where it hit.  Bolt locked his pinsirs and extended his stinger over his back.  It dug into the ground as Houndine jumped and fired bolts of lightning from his horns.  They struck Bolt in the claw and he fell back a little.   <BR>  &#34;Ok guys, thats enough!&#34; Shouted Kain from over the town square. <BR>  &#34;Yeah, leave some strangth for later today!&#34;  Zack yelled.   <BR> <BR>They were watching the road waiting for a centaur when the wind struck up suddenly.  Kea got pushed back abit and looked upwards.  She pointed and made slight high pitched noises.  Alex looked up and told the others to look.  There was a long red shape circling them in the sky, it had wings and was gliding in a circuit.  As it lowered down to earth they saw it was a dragon.  Like the phoenix it had gold armour on and on it back was a tiny carriage like on a blimp.  The dragon stopped motionless and closed its eyes.  Inside the cabin Sam motioned for them to climb up the ladder on the dragons side.  It took a while for everyone to agree but eventually they all got up.  The dragon blasted open its wings and shot off into the air.  They travveked for a long time before they returned to earth.  They could see the stadium, it was massive.  The chairs were allready full of happy spectators and food sellers.  They ground was sand and medics were lining the edges.   <BR>  &#34;The stadium is set up hours before the matches take place.&#34; Explained Sam. <BR>  The next hours went very quickly.  They were taken to a locker room where they sat awaiting the match.  Sam had to leave for a while and make a speech with his FIMBA counterpart, Tom.  They watched the Pre match hysteria on a large T.v. screen inside the changing room.  Eventually Sam and Tom announced the first match.   <BR>  &#34;The first Four match battle to take place will be...&#34; Sam and Tom opened an envelope togethor. <BR>  &#34;Mia Vs. John.&#34;   <BR>The crowed burst into cheers as Mia stood up in the locker room.  Scissora followed her out into the stadium and she saw the crowd.  The stadium was huge and down the pitch she could see a tall burly man dressed in eskimo clothes.  He had a grey beard and laughed heartily as he climbed into his trainer box.  Mia climbed into hers and quickly wished Scissora goodluck.  Sam spoke over a speaker system.   <BR>  &#34;The IMA contendor, Mia with her salamander, Zuum, sub breed Dragon, Scissora.&#34;  The crowd burst into louder cheers.  Tom&#39;s voicew echod across the field. <BR>  &#34;The FIMBA contendor, John with his Bengal, Jill sub breed Kato, Tufty.&#34;   <BR>  Mia and John stared at each other across the arena and their monsters got into their starting blocks.  A whistle blew one short blow, then another then a long one.  This was the cue for the fight to start.  Tufty jumped metres into the air, it was a fairly slow jump but it was powerful, she came down feet curled ready to slam her full weight onto Scissora.  Scissora sumasaulted just out of reach as she landed with a boom.  She turned to face the giant yeti and growled.  Tufty ran up to her and opened her arms.  She brang them togthor on Scissora with great power and scissora went flying into the air.  Jack looked like he was convinced he would win.  Mia shouted across the field. <BR>  &#34;Roll asault!&#34; <BR>  Scissora curled into a ball and span hard as she fell onto Tufty&#39;s unready head.  Tufty looked dizzily around as Scissora landed metres away.  She shook her head a couple of times then focused on Scissora.  Her fists tightened as she unleashed a 1-2 straight.  Her hands left trails of air as she hit Scissora twice in the stomach.  Scissora fell to the floor.  She tried to get up, then fell again.  Medics waited for the sign.  Mia saw John look towards Sam and Tom.  Both of them nodded. <BR>  &#34;John and Tufty win the match&#34; <BR>Mia ran onto the sand and picked up scissora&#39;s head,  she looked happily at her and hugged her neck.  Medics carried her off and Mia walked away with cheers from the croud.  The team welcomed Mia back and she seemed perfectly happy.  She kept saying it was bad luck and as long as Scissora was ok, she didn&#39;t mind.   <BR>  &#34;The second match will be Zack V.S. Linda!&#34;  Tom&#39;s voice boomed out.   <BR>  Zack and Houndine walked silently from the room and walked onto the field.  Across the arena he saw a women clutching what looked like a tiny teddy bear.  She placed it on the floor patted it on the head and went to stand in her trainer box.  Houndine ran out onto his starting point wagging his tail.  He lowered his head and growled at the tiny teddy.  For a teddy the creature looked confident.   <BR>  &#34;The IMA contendor Zack with his Tiger, tiger sub breed tiger, Houndine&#34;  Sam shouted down the microphone. <BR>  &#34;The FIMBA contendor Sally with her eared mew, mew sub breed hare,pokey&#34; <BR>  The whistle blew three times and both monsters stood stationary, bobbing slightly.  Neither attacked but both looked each other up and down.  Houndine was the first to move.  He shot forward, mouth open and snapped at the bunny doll.  It jumped quickly up past his mouth and pushed off his head with its hands.  It landed on Houndines back then used its diving press attack.  Light shot off in all directions as Pokey slammed onto Houndines back.  Houndine looked suprised as his knees buckled but shot straight up again.  He charged straight at pokey and hit it, sending the tiny bunny flying,  It turned in the air and lifted one leg infront of it.  It landed and hopped at Houndine, kicking him in the face.  Houndine exploded with anger, he ran at Pokey biting and clawing continuosy.  Pokey dodged every single attack.  Slowly Houndine got tired, he stopped attacking and Pokey shot forward in a tornado of spinning arms, its twidiling attack.  Houndine fell to the ground and stayed there.   <BR>  &#34;The winners are Sally and Pokey&#34;  <BR>  As soon as this information was announced, Houndine stood up and walked solemly over to Zack.  Zack smiled and ruffled its hair.  They walked back to the locker room.   <BR>  &#34;Ok, people we need you two to win for a draw.&#34;  Zack announced. <BR>  &#34;The next match is between Alex and Linda.&#34;   <BR>  Alex stood up and walked out side mumbling to Zea.  Zea nodded occaisionally.  When she got outside she stepped straight into her trainer box and waited to look at her opponent.   <BR>  &#34;The IMA contendor Alex with her angel, Pixie sub breed Gali, Zea.&#34;  Sam announced to the audience.   <BR>   &#34;The FIMBa competetor Linda with her Icebergy, Baku sub breed Tiger, Bovin&#34; <BR>  Alex saw her opponents monster.  It was huge.  A massive blue and white mammal with small horns on its head.  It could be close.  The baku would badly damage Zea if it could get a shot in.  The whistle sounded three times.  As soon as the third whistle started Bovin charged straight for Zea,  She jumped and spread her wings fluttering off into the air.  She stopped, hovered and turned.  Her hands were closed togethor and she aimed them at Bovin who looked up angrily.  As Zea opened them bolts of powerful lightning shot forth and struck Bovins horns.  He looked slightly jolted as he opened his mouth and launched his twi roars attack.  Two large balls of air shot into the sky towards Zea and only by weaving back and forth did she avoid them.  She dove down and landed on Bovins head.  She tried to toss her off desperately but she hung on.  As she was bucking her leg tripped and the baku slowly fell to the ground.  Dust blew up and Zea flew back up, a ball apeared in Zea&#39;s hands and many beams of light fired from it at the dust.  When it cleared Bovin was lying unconcieus on the floor.   <BR>  &#34;The third Match goes to Alex and Zea&#34; Happily shouted Sam. <BR>  Alex ran out and hugged Zea and the walked back to the locker room.. The three ran up and congratulated her as she entered.   <BR>  &#34;Just me left&#34; said Kain.  &#34;I wonder who I&#39;m up against.&#34;      <BR>   &#34;The final match is between Kain and Father Peter.&#34; <BR>  Kain had heard of a gang of battling monks.  They lived in the FIMBA mountains and raised their monsters spiritually, they rarely entered tournaments. <BR>  He patted Bolt on the head and the two walked out.  On the other side of the arena, a monk and his huge golem were sprinkling rice.  The golem was massive and multicoloured.   <BR>  &#34;The IMA competetor Kain, with his Renocraft, Arrowhead sub breed Hengar, Bolt.&#34; <BR>  &#34;The FIMBA competetor Father Peter, with his Ecologaurdia, Golem sub breed Plant, Life Force&#34; <BR>  Life force slowly stepped into the ring and sat down in a meditating position.  He stared at Bolt as the whistles blew.  He sat there.  Not moving a muscule with his eyes closed.  Bolt waited patiently then moved slightly.  Life force did not move.  Bolt sunk to the floor and extended a quick sting.  Just as it was to reach him, Life forces eyes opened and he grabbed the sting.  He picked Bolt up by the tail and swang him aroud his head.  Life Force let go and Bolt went flying.  He knew he had to do something before he hit the wall, this could be a fatal hit.  He fired his sting into the ground and it dug in, stopping him metres before the wall.  He jumped down and walked back to the now standing Golem.  Life Force smiled and pushed his palm forward hard.  There was a mark on it Bolt recognised.  It hit him, Bolt flew backwards in great pain.  He blinked his one eye.  Where had he seen the mark.  An octogon with eight colours.  He jumped over a flailing arm and landed on the other one.  Life Force was not ready for the sting that hit him in the face.  He fell to the floor and Bolt landed on top of him.  He slammed his pinsirs against his back and jumped until Life Force stopped resisting.  When the announcers announced his win arrowhead punched the air twice in celebration.  Then called Kain into the field.  The audiences cries died down as he pointed to the golems hand.  Kain recognised the mark.  It had been on the paper Kurt had handed him.  He confronted the Monk about the mark. <BR>  &#34;It is a simple mark of our religion.&#34; Hissed the monk spitefully,  &#34;It is none of your buisness&#34;  Tom and Sam were carried to ground by a pair of tiny dragons.     <BR>  &#34;What seems to be the problem Kain?&#34; Asked Sam. <BR>  &#34;A man bearing this mark attacked my ranch before i was invited to this tourney.  The other trainers were on the field now and he audience were talking hurriedly.   <BR>  &#34;Hey!&#34; shouted Zack.  &#34;A guy had that tatoo on his arm and attacked my ranch before i came here.  Houndine caught him and he ran off afterwards.&#34; <BR>  Sam looked at the mark.  Then appeared to be thinking.  He suddenyl clicked his fingers. <BR>  &#34;Father Peter you are under arrest for cruelty to Monsters.  This mark was found on several forced labour monster camps around the world.  Police get him!&#34;   <BR>A police team ran on to the pitch at the monk, he snarled angrily and dropped a smoke bomb to the floor.  The police coughed and spluttered as he tried to run.  Their was a growl and a scream.  When the smoke cleared Houndine was standing on top of the monk.  Sam and Tom whispered quitely then Sam spoke into a small walkie talkie.  He stood up and held the microphone to his mouth. <BR>  &#34;Allthough these matches resulted in a draw and the teams are required to enter one more battle,  we have chosen to disqualify the FIMBA team for one of their members mortifying past.  It therefore gives me great pleasure to announce the IMA team official winners of the first Four Match, congratulations.   <BR> <BR>It was two weeks later that they decided to leave on a journey.  Together the four people needed to travvel and adventure.  The monks were after them.  They knew their adventures would not stop there.  But they had won the tourney.  Kain, Mia, Alex, Zack, Bolt, Houndine, Zea and Scissora left down a windy rode wearing backpacks.  From millions of miles above a face watched them.  It was their next challenge.  They had no idea what it was.   <BR> <BR>Please post what you think of this story below.  I will try to write the next part for Saturday.
