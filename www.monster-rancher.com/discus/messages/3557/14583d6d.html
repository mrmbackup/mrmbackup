 Roketh stepped forward, as if to take the first shot. Nightmare merely held up his palms in the direction of the Dragon that matched his size. Few can boast that. <BR> <BR>&#34;Now, now. Calm yourself. I have no quarrel with you. My mission is done but, I was wondering how long you would sit there.&#34; Nightmare said as he lowered his hands to his side. <BR> <BR>&#34;What? You knew we were there?&#34; Jace asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;Of course. How could I not sense a combat rating THAT high. Now stay out of this monkey. Let the big boys discus this.&#34; Nightmare said as he made a quick motion towards the human. <BR> <BR>Roketh took a step towards Nightmare, &#34;Watch it. Leave them out of this.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh your no fun. Humans are such a good source of entertainment. You really should make a living killing them. Pays not great but hey, no job is perfect.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Silence!&#34; Roketh roared at the purple fiend. <BR> <BR>&#34;Watch it there boy,&#34; Nightmare said, becoming deathly serious, &#34;your strong yes, but in no way are you a match for me. You may be a useful ally.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Never scum. I am Roketh. Lord of the Eight Lords. I will see you are destroied. I was destined to destroy your evil.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What? Surely you do not belive I run the show.&#34; Nightmare said, &#34;Few match my skills, and I serve the strongest.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You lie...and now you die.&#34; Roketh said. Seeing the joy he had in killing, Roketh knew he had to be stopped. <BR> <BR>Just then, Bloodlust stumbled forth from his crater. He walked towards Roketh, having heard what the Dragon said. He collapsed and Jace helped him up the best he could. Denemaur joined him and they carried the Durahan behind Vyger, who stood behind Roketh. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, if you won&#39;t join, I suppose I could get some enjoyment from your death. Let it be known, any who stand before me or my master shall die.&#34; He stared strait at Roketh before saying, &#34;And that means you. Hampering my work is in the master&#39;s why.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Let us do this. If you do have a better, know this: I am he.&#34; <BR> <BR>The purple Dragon flew backwards at a blinding speed, sending up a cloud of dust. Roketh could not see, and braced for an attack. None came. He looked up to see the beast a little ways away, his wings draped over him to from his ebony cape. His patented grin graced his face as Roketh approached. Suddenly, Nightmare disappeared in a flash of purple haze. Roketh saw him in the air, high above him. Roketh took flight and prepared for an all-out aerial battle. Nightmare was almost directly over head, still going upwards. Roketh persude. Then, Nightmare spun and dove striat towards Roketh with both hands pointing strait down. Roketh grabbed his writs quickly and spun backwards, delivering a massive knee to the gut of Nightmare. He spun to where his knee was still in the Dragon&#39;s stomache and they were plummeting, fast. Nightmare knew he would be crushed under the weight and knew this one would be a tough battle indeed. Nightmare spun around the side of Roketh and nailed a balled-up fist into the Dragon&#39;s jaw. Roketh felt he was now not just falling, he was being knocked down to earth. Another well placed shot and he could hit the ground with dead weight and the force of Nightmare. <BR> <BR>Roketh decide to take a differant approach. Nightmare was clearly more agile and would win in the air. Roketh had to ground him. He then had the most heart-wrenching thought of his entire life, &#34;Where&#39;d he go?&#34; <BR> <BR>Indeed, Nightmare was no where to be seen. Then, Roketh had a sudden feeling to dodge. Somehow he knew, no sensed, that Nightmare was above him. He quickly shot to the right as Nightmare shot past him. Taking advantage of the situation, Roketh dropped a heel into the Dragon&#39;s mouth. Nightmare spun towards the earth out of control. He slammed into a small cliff edge, not far from the crater Bloodlust was in. He found himself in an imprint of himself. Suddenly, two claws gripped his shoulders. He looked up to see Roketh staring back at him. Roketh prepared to say something, but suddenly found the wind knocked out of him. Nightmare kicked him in the stomache so hard that the Dragon went airbone out of the crater. Roketh began to hover but, as he looked up, Nightmare was barreling out of his hole, strait towards Roketh. Roketh pretended he didn&#39;t see him. Before Nightmare could strike, Roketh put every once of his strength into his wings. He forced his shoulder into the un-suspecting Nightmare&#39;s gut. Nightmare found himself flying backward with the force of Roketh&#39;s single stroke of wing. Pain was a sinsation not too familiar to Nightmare, but he now found it rampaging throughout his body. He coughed as he found he could not stop the force of the beast at the moment. As he coughed, he saw something he had never seen before, his blood. Blood flew from his mouth and, not being pushed by the force of the beast, seemingly flew off into the distance. Suddenly, pain filled his back as he was drivin into the same hole he had tried to come out of. Roketh got a firm grip on the rock with his back feet and spring-boarded off of the cliff edge. He stared down at the battered Nightmare. He knew he must end it now. He pulled out his best move, knowing it was the only thing that could do the trick. <BR> <BR>&#34;DEMON FLARE!&#34; His words seemed to echo through the battlefield. He opened his mouth in the direction of Nightmare. Nightmare could do nothing but watch from his hole. Nightmare pulled his old healing technique out of his bag. <BR> <BR>&#34;DRAGON HEAL!&#34; Instantly, his wounds filled up, his bones were set, and his body fully reconstructed. He looked up and decide to see if this attack was worth it. <BR> <BR>He emerged from his hole, flying up towards Roketh. He got about even with Roketh, about fifty yards away and screamed, &#34;Lets see it!&#34; <BR> <BR>Energy seemed to gather from the air around him, forming a red ball in front of his mouth. The ball turned into a net, covering Roketh&#39;s mouth. Then, Roketh let out the largest fire stream he could muster. The net began to fill up and formed a huge, demonic creatue. Made of pure fire, it began to go strait towards Nightmare. Nightmare grinned as it hurtled towards him. <BR> <BR>The ensuing explosion knock Roketh from the sky. He landed by Jace and the others. They all stared into the sky, seeing nothing but dust falling and smoke clearing. <BR> <BR>&#34;Tisk, tisk. So much effort, too.&#34; A voice rang from in front of them. Roketh lowered his gaze to look Nightmare in the eyes. He had took the shot Roketh saw that but, he stood here now untouched. <BR> <BR>&#34;My turn Dragon, you were a worthy opponent.&#34; Nightmare said simply. <BR> <BR>Nightmare curled his arms around his body, his wings curled around them. He was heard screaming, &#34;Fools! Witness my true power! My raw nature!&#34; <BR>Nightmare bent over, seeming to shake and tremble. <BR> <BR>&#34;EVOLUTION!&#34; He screamed. As he did, he un-curled his wings and arm in the same instance. As he outstreched them, he screamed a gut-wrenching cry. Purple energy rings shot off of him in a sphereical motion. Energy seemed to burst out of him as he yelled. A purpleish fire seemed to be around him. Egnited by his awesome power. His eyes grew a bright purple, to the point his pupils could not be seen. He began to laugh an unworldly laugh. His arms began to sweat and unusual amount. Yellow liquids began to cover his body. His wings seemed as if they were getting larger. The joint on each wing grew a black, spiraling spire from their very bone. From his head, two massive horns formed, above the eyes and going forwards. Then curving slightly upwards. His face grew somewhat longer and a bit thicker. Two teeth grew unusually large from the top of his mouth, missing the lower jaw but surpassing it none the less. A large, red mane grew just behing the head. He began to look something like a croos between a dragon, a wolf, and a lion. His forarms began to shake violantly before errupting. Nightmare let out a scream of pain as his second set of arms began to come out. However, they were not entirely seperate. He now had four forarms, but two connected to one elbow. His claws began to strech and tear through the skin holding them, trying to enlarge themselves from their small confines. The skin stretched and grafted itself as part of the evolution. The purple energy disappated and the Drrgon then stood upright. What once was the same size as Roketh, now dwarfed the Dragon. A row of Ebony spikes had appeared along his neck and went down his spine, between his wings, and down his two tails. They then realized that another tail had come out as well, each boasting a mace-like bone on the end of them. The spikes grew larger from the head down to the back. After the back, the spikes grew smaller towards the tail. This beast was the most frightening thing Roketh had ever seen. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ready for round two?&#34; Nightmare asked with a sinister grin. <BR> <BR>&#34;My...Lord..&#34; A faint voice came from behind Roketh. He turned to see Bloodlust on his back, reaching for him. Roketh grasped the Durahan&#39;s only hand. The Durahan bagan to glow yellow. Denemaur placed his hand on Roketh&#39;s shoulder, and he too, began to glow a greenish color. <BR> <BR>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Roketh said as they radiated. <BR> <BR>&#34;You are the Lord,&#34; Denemaur said, &#34;We grant you our powers. Our time has passed. <BR> <BR>Sharp pains entered Roketh&#39;s body. One in his hand, the other on his shoulder. Power surged into him. Even after it filled him, still more came. Bloodlust&#39;s glow faded. His armour went black, and began to crumble without the essence of its master. <BR> <BR>&#34;No! Stop!&#34; Roketh pleaded. Denemaur merely said to him, &#34;We must, for the world.&#34; <BR> <BR>Denemaur&#39;s red eyes faded into black sockets. The ebony Pressure fell over on his side, never more to fight. Roketh became enraged and, for the first time ever, Nightmare was scared. Roketh turned to the monstrousity. He held up his hands towards the Dragon. Nightmare knew the legend. He could combine any two to three elemental powers to form an attack. Water and Combat didn&#39;t sound to appealing. <BR> <BR>&#34;LIQUID RAZOR DISK!&#34; Roketh held his hand above his head. A saucer of water appeared from nowhere. Small spikes appeared around the disk. He threw it with all of his might. The disk spun wildy towards Nightmare. <BR> <BR>&#34;Sorry kid, I still gotta test this body&#39;s limits and learn how to use it. I suggest you do the same. We will meet again.Then I shall kill you.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, Nightmare disappeared in a blurry haze of purple fog. The disk cut through the fog, barely missing its target. It exploded a short ways away. <BR> <BR>About 6 hours later... <BR> <BR>Roketh, Jace, and Vyger stood over two graves. They had carved stones to mark these two great combatants. Roketh was the only one to speak. <BR> <BR>&#34;I understand know. I will find the other lords before they are destroied. Nightmare will pay for this. You sacrficed your lives. Through your demise, through your unselfish gesture, I will have Nightmares head, and his master&#39;s.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Stay tuned, CHB
