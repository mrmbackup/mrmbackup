 Rise Of The Master <BR> <BR> <BR>Prologue: <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Who&#39;s there!&#34;Screamed the store clerk from behind his counter.&#34;We&#39;re closed!&#34; <BR>	 <BR>He waited, hearing only the sound of a nearby tree scratching the side of his store. Finally the silence was disturbed as the front door swung open, creaking at it&#39;s hinges. The cold night air flowed freely, sending an icy chill down the shopkeepers spine as he peered into the darkness. A deep fog had settled outside, visiblity was horrible, yet something was there. A slender figure in a dark grey cloak appeared in the open doorway. Face shrouded by a hood, the person walked quickly towards the clerk. He noticed an unusal sound as the stranger approached, like claws scraping his wooden floor. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Are ya deaf?&#34;The clerk screamed&#34;This shop is closed! Do you have any idea how lat-&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I wish to make a transaction,&#34;Said a female voice from under the hood. Then, from within the folds of the cloak she brought forth a large sack of gold.&#34;This is what I will pay for the item I seek.&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Well now,&#34;The man smiled greedily&#34;Why didn&#39;t you say so? Whatever you want i&#39;m sure I can get it for ya!&#34; <BR>	 <BR>The cloaked woman stepped to her right and looked over his shoulder before saying,&#34;That piece behind you. I want it.&#34; She pointed to an ancient circuit board. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;This?&#34;He asked, picking it up.&#34;Sure, some old peddler sold it to me. Don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want it though, just a worthless piece of scrap. I don&#39;t even know what it is, but hey it&#39;s your money....Then again, if your willing to pay so much for it&#39;s not so worthless after all. I want double, no triple the original amount.&#34; <BR>	 <BR>Suddenly the front wall exploded in a ball of fire. The wall and half of the doorway were reduced to a shower of splinters. Then, as the cloud of saw dust cleared anouther figure appeared from outside. A huge Zuum shaped creature with blood red scales and talons that measured over a foot long. It was a Salamader, the clerk knew, he&#39;d seen one fight back when he was a boy at a tournament. The cloaked stranger then tossed off her cloaked and revealed her true form. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;S-some sorta pixie??&#34;He studdered looking only half at her as the hungry Salamander edged closer. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;A daina to be exact,&#34;She said&#34;Or at least that is what you humans have named my find....the artifact, give it to me!&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Oh no ya don&#39;t! I&#39;ve got a monster of my own!&#34;He said&#34;Spike! Where are you!?&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;If you mean that tiger....&#34;The Salamader hissed&#34;He won&#39;t be listening to your commands any longer.&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Y-You killed him??&#34;The clerk panicked. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I perfer to say I liberated him from your control,&#34;The Salamander hissed angrily.&#34;The artifact.&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Here....&#34;He handed the board over willingly, greatly depressed over the loss of the tiger which he&#39;d raised from birth.  <BR>	 <BR>Without anouther word the two monsters left swiftly leaving the clerk and emotional wreck and his shop in shambles. Outside they stood on the fog covered road. The pawn shop was a mile outside town, the owner had converted his house into it, perhaps to attract travelers on their way to or from the town a mile down the road.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Bet he never thought he&#39;d have customers like us,&#34;The Salamader laughed&#34;Should have built a hotel instead anyway, eh Shielka?&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;What does it matter Zarzaas?&#34;She said examining the circuit board&#34;I just hope this one works. Ancient tech isn&#39;t exactly easy to find.&#34; <BR>	 <BR>Zarzaas shook his scaley head,&#34;Not with that acursed Moo around. But he&#39;ll get his. He&#39;ll regrete the day he made an enemy of the Master. We-&#34; <BR>	 <BR>He stoped, hearing the sound of heavy footsteps. Out of the dense fog a massive black Beaclon approached, it&#39;s red eyes scanning the area. It was a jaggernaut, a devilish mix of the Beaclons unbelievable power with a jokers wicked intellect. It turned slowly toward the store and made a angry noise as though the very building disgusted him. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;On this road...&#34;Darkclon said in a deep, devious voice&#34;Hotel would make more profit.&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Whats with you guys!?&#34;Shielka screamed at them both&#34;Who cares if it&#39;s a hotel or not? We have what the master wants, thats what matters. I&#39;ll meet you two later.&#34; She spread her wings and took flight, beating furiously to get off the ground before gliding to her next destination. Meanwhile the others were left with nothing to do... <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Hey, didn&#39;t the master say no witnesses?&#34;Zarzaas asked his gigantic friend.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;....Yes,&#34;Darkclon turned his hateful gaze toward the store,&#34;He did.&#34; <BR> <BR>	Meanwhile Shielka raced along the night wind as fast as her wings could carry her. Glancing back, the others were already out of sight. However a pillar of black smoke could be seen rising into the sky. The trip back was a long one and it was three days before she beheld the volcanic wasteland she called home. Exhuasted the daina dived toward a long dormant volcano on the edge of this country. Built into it was a towering steel door , that opened automaticly on her coming. Inside the temperature was extremely high, but for a Daina who bathed in lava itself it was very comfortable. Infact it had been the first time Shielka had been warm since leaving on the mission. Inside, not far from the door was an elevator. She entered and it plunged downward into the somewhat cooler earth. After only a few moments the elevator door opened and she stepped out. The room she was now in was almost pitch dark except for a dim light just overhead. From what could be seen the room was metal walled and filled with all sorts of technology that had somehow been spared by time. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Did you acquire it?&#34;A voice said from the darkness. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Yes master,&#34;She fell to one knee and held out the circuit board. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Indeed, well done!&#34;A long grey tendril reached out of the shadows and grasped the artifact, pulling it back into darkness. A few moments passed as the Master examined it and Shielka wondered just how he could see anything the dark. At last he spoke. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;This should work,&#34;He said with confidence&#34;You have done well in serving your master. All we need is a few more items and we&#39;ll be prepared.&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Assuming the Hengers can repair the thing,&#34;She added. <BR>	 <BR>&#34;They will, Now go! Gather my warriors!&#34;Master said&#34;At last...after all these years of planing, waiting for this moment. Finally my time has come. Moo will fall along side the wretched plague of humanity. The reign of the Master is at hand.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter 1:Thieves in the night <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Welcome ladies and Gentlemen to the Official S cup Tournament!&#34; The Announcer screamed to the crowd&#34;And now our final match! Tied for first place...hailing from Damien&#39;s ranch, the evil hare, Dark Fist!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>An unusually large evil hare stalked out onto the arena floor and began to shadow box. He was fast and powerful, anyone could see he&#39;d been trained well. But from his seat in the front row a young rancher known only as Cid was confident his was the better fighter.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;An his opponent!&#34;The Announcer yelled&#34;Also tied in first, the crowd favorite, in his final match before retirement! The Durahan destroyer, Justice!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>The crowd rose to their feet in applause as Justice made his way to the arena for his final match. As the crowd cheered on the match began. Dark Fist attacked with a fury of blows which Justice didn&#39;t bother to avoid. In a matter of seconds the Hare had exhausted itself and had not the will to continue fighting. Thats when the seasoned veteran of the arena made his move with a brutal slash combo. Dark fist went down, the fight seemed to be over as quickly as it had begun. But the evil hair wasn&#39;t done just yet, pulling himself together for one last effort. The Durahan payed little heed to it&#39;s lesser opponent. He could defeat this hare with a simple and effective charge, indeed thats what his trainer was telling him to do from the stands. But this was his last match, the ending had to be spectacular. Therefore Justice summoned his most powerful attack, energy surrounded his steel form as he focused his own life force into his sword for a great finish. He attacked, but the sword hit only air before impacting with the ground. His blade stuck deep within the arena floor and slightly drained from the death bringer justice was distracted long enough for his enemy to sneak around behind. Then the evil hare unloaded one of his most potent techniques, bang. The durahans knees buckled from the force. Then after a graceful back flip his enemy attacked again with a dragon kick, it&#39;s foot becoming a ball of fire. Perhaps a less experienced monster would have fallen then but Justice lifted his shield and blocked the hare&#39;s devastating kick. Breaking his leg on the shield Dark fist fell to the ground and could not continue. His trainer ran in and forfieted the match before Justice could do more harm.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;The winner!&#34;The announcer said, holding up his steel arm. The crowd roared on.&#34;The winner of the Official S class is Justice! Everyone give this warrior a big round of applause, this was his last match!&#34;  <BR> <BR>One hour later......  <BR> <BR>	Last match, the words echoed in the champions mind long after his trainer collected the gold. Now he walked silently along side his master on the journey back to the ranch through the open grasslands. Final match? Retirement? It seemed like only yesterday he was in his prime, working hard to keep his 309-0 win streak alive and well. Now he was walking away from the one thing he felt made his life meaningful. What hurt worst of all was the slow realization that they were right. He was getting old, nearly loseing to an opponent he&#39;d have desimated only a year ago in flawless victory. Now here he was, just anouther has been.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;You should be glad,&#34;His trainer said&#34;Not many monsters go out with the kind of record you have. Not only that but you just go me up anouther rank. I&#39;m proud of you.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Proud?&#34;Justice said solomly&#34;I never even made it to the big four like Stone claw. It was my dream....&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;It&#39;s the dream of many monsters,&#34;Cid patted his monster on it&#39;s shoulder.&#34;Stone Claw got there but...lets just change the subject.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>It was evening when they arrived back at the ranch. It was even larger then most, with a huge expanse of land that had been in Cid&#39;s family for generations. It was mostly flat praire with many bunches of trees here and there. The house was not very large but quite comfortable. The Stable was much larger although at the moment only two monsters lived on the ranch including justice himself. After bidding his master goodnight the durahan headed for the stable.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Psssss, Justice...&#34; A snakelike voice called. In the far corner of the stable stood a large cell. Held within was Stone claw, a Trident, glaring through the metal bars. He had once been Cid&#39;s greatest monster, his crowning achivement as a rancher. A deadly combination of Naga and Golem, strangly intellegent given his parents, Stone claw seemed to have no equal. But even as a baby he was extremly violent and as he aged it only became worse. After blatently killing a mocchi in the Big four tournaments he was knocked back down to S class. After killing three more monsters and severly injuring the rest in a series of savage attacks, most taking place AFTER he&#39;d won a bout Claw was banned from monster battles in the IMA reigion and Cid&#39;s trainer status was dropped as well. They threatened to have him put down if he wasn&#39;t caged.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I won,&#34;Justice said dryly, placing his sword up on a mantle piece that held many of his favorite trophys. Hundreds more still lined the walls of the house.&#34;And...I&#39;m retired.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Good for you,&#34;He hissed&#34;Now you can enjoy all the good things life offers a monster no longer fighting...like sitting on your metal butt all day watching the clouds slooooowly float by. Getting excited over a new bottle of armor polish. Wasting the rest of your miserable-&#34; <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Shut up snake,&#34;Justice said as he leaned against the wall to sleep.  <BR>	 <BR>Much later that evening about 2:00 in the morning Justice awoke from an uneasy slumber. He sensed a presence outside that disturbed him deeply. At first the Durahan thought he was still dreaming but quickly realized it wasn&#39;t a dream at all. Two sounds could be heard outside, one was the steady, clanking footsteps of anouther Durahan. The other was a slow dragging sound, like something heavy pulling itself along the grass. Justice stood errect and grabed his sword and shield. Somehow, instinctivly he knew his master was in danger.  <BR>	 <BR>Outside he noticed that it was even darker then usual. No stars shined in the night sky, their light blocked by grey clouds coming over the distant mountains. Even the light of the cresent moon was blocked by them. Running with all the speed his metalic body allowed, he came to the front door of Cid&#39;s house. Everything looked normal, no sign of forced entry, no sound of struggle inside. He reached for ther nob to check. Suddenly a red sword crashed through the door nearly stabing Justice in his armored chest. The door shattered under the force of the blow and from within the house a tall Lorica stepped out.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Who are you??&#34;Justice asked, noticing a strange symbol on the monsters chest. Not the crest of Moo, but a single eye. The pupil of the eye had two colors, one side red, the other black. The Lorica laughed, tapping it&#39;s sword over it&#39;s shoulder.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;What does it matter to you? Slave of humanity.&#34;It said with disgust. &#34;You have betrayed your kind. I am Vor, your executioner.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Without anouther word Vor attacked with a triple slash. Justice blocked each blow with his shield but was amazed by the strength of his adversary. Each sent shockwaves through the Durahan&#39;s steel body and brought him to his knees.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Stand up!&#34;Vor taunted&#34;Stand and face me! At least die with what little pride you still possess! I wi-Aaarrrgggghhhh!!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Justice would not be defeated so easily and slashed his enemy in a flash of light. Vor staggered back and Justice pressed his advantage attacking with all his worth, put every last shread of power he had in each strike. At last Vor had enough, blocking the next slash and countering with a million stabs attack. To slow to dodge, Justice was hit many times, the Lorica&#39;s blade slicing into his armor. At last the proud warrior fell to his knees in defeat and Vor lifted his blade high overhead to deliver the death blow.  <BR>	 <BR>He stopped, hearing a loud crashing sound from the house. The nearby window exploded into a casscade of broken glass. A huge Aqua cutter slid out onto the grass. A naga mixed with a jell the monster was nearly invisible. Only it&#39;s cold piercing eyes could be seen clearly. It also bore the strange symbol of the eye.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I&#39;ve found it,&#34;It said, handing Vor an amulet with a large jemstone embedded into it. Justice knew it was a family heirloom that the master treasured.&#34;Had it in plain view, easy to find. I do good?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Good work liqua.&#34;He said staring at justice.&#34;I&#39;ll let you live for now old timer. Remember the feeling of defeat, relish it. For next time we meet you will join your master in oblivion!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Master!!&#34;Justice pulled himself up and entered the house. He soon found his master, in the bedroom. He lay on the floor covered in blood, stabbed to death by a Naga&#39;s claws. Blinded momentarily, the knight stubbled outside only to find Cid&#39;s murders already gone. It was at this moment when the horrible truth finally sunk in. His master and best friend was dead....  <BR>	 <BR>Meanwhile, in the nearby town many where awakened from their sleep by a terrible sound. Many wondered what it could be. Some opened their windows and looked out to the far horizen. The cry came from the ranch over the hill, a sound of pure anguish and pain.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Chapter 2:The Journey  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I swear to you, I will find those responsible and make them pay!&#34; Justice said, kneeling over the humble grave of his master. Morning had come bright and hot over the horizen. But for Justice it was the darkest, coldest day of his life. He had failed to protect his trainer from harm. But the monsters who did this would not escape. The thieves who murdered Cid and stolen his most prized possession would soon share his fate.  <BR>	 <BR>Biding a final farwell to his lifelong friend the warrior turned away and began his journey for vengence. He had already packed up a few provisions but hoped this whole bloody affair could be taken care of quickly. Justice wanted only to return home with the heads of his enemies and spend his last days watching over his masters grave. Trusted sword held over his shoulder Justice turned away at last, stopping by the stables on the way. Here, in a dark corner Stone claw waited within his cell. His piercing eyes stareing through the metal bars hungrily.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Old man!&#34;The Trident yelled&#34;When does the warden plan on feeding me? Bad enough I&#39;m traped in here, the least that idiot could do is serve breakfast on time!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t call him that again!&#34;Juctice thundered&#34;Cid is dead claw, murdered in the night by two monsters who don&#39;t have long to live. I will find them where ever they run, where ever they hide. I will hunt them down and seek revenge even if it leads to my demise.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Sounds fun,&#34;Claw smiled&#34;Your not going leave me here are you? After all, with the boss pushin daisys who&#39;s gonna feed me?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Do you feel nothing?&#34;Asked Justice&#34;No remorse? No sadness over our loss?? He&#39;s dead Claw! Killed in cold blood.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;What do you want me to do?&#34;Claw said&#34;Should I get upset and start screamin &#39;Why!?&#39; all night like you? Look what he did to me! I can&#39;t even move in this cursed cage! After all those years of risking death in the tournaments this is how I&#39;m repayed!? The gold I won paid the bills around here for years, I made this ranch!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;It was for your own good,&#34;The durahan replied&#34;The IMA would have had you put down.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Death would be better then this constant torture...&#34;Stone claw slumped back in his cage&#34;If your not going to free me I have nothing more to say. To hell with you!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Justice thought a moment before bringing forth a steel key. The key clicked into place and after a good turn the cell unlocked. The metal door opened slowly and Stone claw slid out. He was a huge trident, even larger then most and even more bloodthirsty. He stretched a moment, his stone muscles crackling, and took a long breath of fresh air.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Now lets get some things straight,&#34;Justice said in a commanding tone&#34;You must NOT attack, slash, main, brutalize, beat, kill or eat anyone unless I say so. Consider me your master from now on. I&#39;m giving you one chance friend, step out of line and I&#39;ll kill you myself.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;So what your saying is,&#34;Claw grined, showing his teeth&#34;That we&#39;re going to have no fun whatsoever. But fine, i&#39;ll behave, infact I even take back one third of all the insults i&#39;ve spit at you over the years.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Justice just shrugged his metal shoulders before adding sarcasticly &#34;I&#39;m honored.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Soon the two monsters left the ranch they called home and set out along the main road. It was a warm day, getting hotter as time bore on. Endless fields of grass stretched out before them in every direction. Further along the path the landscape change abruptly from flat praire to rolling hills. They headed for the nearest inhabited area, the small town of Golran. Hopefully they could get some information on which way the thieves headed, right now Justice and Claw were just wandering aimlessly. As the day wore on into evening Justice began to wonder about the thieves, in particular the strange crest they adorned. They were perhaps, a unique sect of Moo&#39;s forces. But the evil ones minions had rarely been seen in the area and no nearby village was attacked thus far.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;We&#39;re almost there,&#34;Justice said to his traveling companion.&#34;Golran is a peaceful and tranquil village with a generous mayor. Surely they will aid us in our quest.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Oh,&#34;Claw said&#34;You mean the town up ahead thats burning to the ground as we speak?&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;What??&#34;Justice looked up and saw several pillars of black smoke rising into the darkening sky. They picked up the pace, clearing the final hill they at last beheld thier destination. Unfortunetly it wasn&#39;t in the shape Justice expected to find it. The town of Golran was under attack. Several buildings already stood ablaze, crumbling to thier foundations as the fire consumed them. Thick smoke continued to pour into the sky. Many purple shapes ran through the town with startling agility, cutting down many where they stood.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Lets go claw!&#34;The Durahan tightened his grip on the his sword and led the charge, stone claw close behind. They reached the town in about five minutes, by this time the battle was already over. Those few who had strength enough to fight had already fallen and the streets were littered with the bodies of monsters and humans alike. The town of Golran had fallen under the control of the attacking force. Justice and claw snuck in, hiding near one of the few buildings still standing. A host of naga saurians stalked and patroled the area, all wore the crest of the dreaded moo. Their captain was busy interrogating the mayor in the market place, threatening and snaping at the man when hs didn&#39;t cooperate.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Looking for disks?&#34;Stone claw wondered aloud but after a few minutes of intent listening he spoke again.&#34;No, they are after the same ones we are. The mayor says they headed north, thats all he knows.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I didn&#39;t know you could hear so well,&#34;said Justice.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;One of my many talents.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;That may be,&#34;The durahan said&#34;But it doesn&#39;t matter now. I can not stand by and watch this. Come, we must take back this town!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Charging out from their hiding place they attacked, catching the saurians off guard. Justice cut down three before sinking his blade into the captain while Claw mauled the remaining zuum types. Before dieing by the durahan&#39;s sword the saurian leader gave one last cry that alerted every naga saurian in the area. In a matter of seconds the two found themselves surrounded by thirty of the beasts.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Is this all they have?&#34;Claw laughed with justice at his back.&#34;They don&#39;t know who thier dealing with, eh old man.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Agreed,&#34;He said&#34;So why don&#39;t we teach them.&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Justice attacked with a twister slash, killing seven saurians as the ran into his twirling blade. With a few quick swipes of his sword many more fell to the durahan. Claw fought like a demon, not even using any special attacks. Instead he tore into his enemies with his deadly talons, tearing the outmatched saurians apart. As the pair carved a bloody path through the legions of moo those few remaining fled for thier lives. By this time very few saurians had been spared. Silence followed, the battle had been far to easy. Then, heavy footsteps hailed the coming of anouther of moo&#39;s followers. The sound came from the east, the mayors house obstructing the view. Suddenly the house began to shake, tearing itself in half. Whatever it was planed to come straight through. After a few moments a massive golem type bearing the sign of moo burst through the mayors now destroyed home. Justice had never seen a golem as fearsome as this one in all his years fighting in the tournaments. It was a Tyrant, perhaps on of the most power monsters of all. It stared at them a moment before raising it&#39;s great fists over head and slaming them into the ground.  <BR>	 <BR>The ensueing shock waves caused the ground to errupt violently, sending sharp stones jutting out in it&#39;s wake. Justice and Stone claw avoided it as several houses crumbled to dust in the distance. Realizing the good amount of distance between he and his opponent justice attacked with a rolling slash. The Tyrant slaped him out of the air like an annoying little insect. As he recovered Stone claw attacked with energy shots. Hurling balls of dark energy at the tyrant. The golem was more angry then injured however and countered with a fist shot. Claw was knock back twenty feet and right through a store window. That left only justice to fend off the enemy, he charged and was hit with a huge uppercut sending the durahan to the ground.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I&#39;m getting too old for this,&#34;Justice said under his breath, useing his sword as a brace to help him stand. But then he saw something flying toward the tyrant. He realized it was some kind of hare useing a dragon kick. The hare nailed it&#39;s target in the chest and the tyrant staggered back slightly before attacking with a palm strike. The hare avoided the strike easily, landing not far from where justice stood. He could see it was a fairy hare, but what it was going here he had no idea.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Where did you come from?&#34;He asked the fairy hare.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Just passin by,&#34;She said&#34;Watch out!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>Justice didn&#39;t see the fist shot coming but was able to avoid it thanks to the hares warning. About this time Stone claw emerged from the store he&#39;d been hurled into. The Tyrant laughed deeply and seeing that his opponents were reluctent to attack he smashed his fist through a nearby house, pulling a man out. He then tossed the guy to the ground before steping on him like a bug.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Enough! You will do no more harm to these people!&#34;Justice raised his sword&#34;Everyone, attack!&#34; He summoned the power of lightening against the tyrant. Shocked from the blast, the warrior took his sword in hand and hurled in at the tyrants chest. It sliced through cleanly but the servent of moo still lived. The fairy hare attacked again with a dragon kick, reeling from the blows the tyrant feel to one knee giving Stone claw enough time to employ his life drain. Draining the tyrants life force it fell backward dead, hitting the ground with the force of a small explosion. A few more house collapsed at this point.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Good work, we&#39;ve save the village!&#34;Justice said as he plucked his blade from the chest of the tyrant and raised it to the heavens in victory. For a moment he relived the glory of his younger days before the mayors angry voice brought him back to the present.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Saved? What are you talking about?&#34;He said&#34;At least before you arrived half the town was still standing, now look at it!&#34; Justice glanced around and realized that nearly every structure had been flatened during the battle. Indeed it was no longer even a town, just a really large pile of rubble. A furious crowd gathered around them.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;I would gladly pay for any damages we have inccured,&#34;Justice said&#34; But I don&#39;t have to much money at the moment. If you would-  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Get them!&#34;Someone from within the crazed mob shouted and everyone else cried in agreement.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Thats gratitude for ya!&#34;Said the fairy hare.  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Ungrateful humans, there all the same!&#34;Claw hissed and swiped at the crowd with his talons &#34;Come on! I&#39;ll massacare each and every one of you! Come on!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Enough claw,&#34;Justice said&#34;We know where our quarry headed. Lets just get out of here!&#34;  <BR>	 <BR>&#34;Hey! Wait for me!&#34;The hare called after them.
