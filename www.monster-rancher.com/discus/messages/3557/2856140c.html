 Dadge flew backward as fast as he could. On top of the fact the queen was in that hole, she was in the largest hole in the wall. He slowed down and stopped, training his Harvenger into the black depths of the colony&#39;s hive. Then, two large, red, piercing eyes appeared in the darkness. Dadge aimed his weapon right at the center of the tremendous eyes that seemed to cut through him like butter. <BR> <BR>&#34;Fool, you honestly believe you are powerful enough to defeat me? The Queen of the Swarm and the future ruler of your miserable world?&#34; She spoke slowly, almost mockingly, as Dadge only became more and more unsure of himself. <BR> <BR>&#34;I do not believe I can kill you, I know I can.&#34; Dadge said as he tried to act confident. His disguise quickly melted as a gut-wrenching laugh erupted from the crevasse. <BR> <BR>Then, a massive, insectoid arm reached out and grasped the edge of the hole. Dadge was horrified by the size of the arm alone. Then, another came out and grasped the other side. Then another and still another protruded from the darkness. Four, gargantuan limbs now had a firm grip on the rim of the black oval. Dadge watched in utter disbelief as the arms began pulling on something large within the cave, dragging out something Dadge was not too eager to meet. Soon, a large, bug like form appeared, standing mere yards from Dadge, who hovered still. <BR> <BR>The thing had four, massive legs. At the base of these legs, was a giant mouth. Not a flat mouth either, a full, connected jaw and skull. It best resembled the head of a T-Rex. Long snout, lined with flesh-ripping teeth. It had a small pivot point right under its head, this is where all of its legs connected, then ran into the brain like a spinal cord. <BR> <BR>Dadge&#39;s helm became alive with cluster and clamor from the Jill&#39;s headquarters. Then, Grendel came over the air screaming, &#34;That&#39;s her, KILL HER NOW!&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge really didn&#39;t have time to answer back. One of the legs was flying towards him, pointy end first so to speak. Dadge threw his feet to his left, this of course making him fly right at a high rate of speed. The leg flew through the air, slightly jerking the queen as she attempted to stop herself. <BR> <BR>&#34;Impressive human, your one of the few that has officially lasted more than one shot.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You fixing&#39; to be a heck of a lot more impressed, beast.&#34; Dadge said as he began to circle her. <BR> <BR>Dadge looked at his wrist panel and changed his jetpack fuel intake from 30% to 70%, enough to gain some momentum, and still have enough to get away if need be. As he sped up, he held his arms to his sides to help him be more aerodynamic, or cut through the air better and faster. After a few laughs and more of his advisory&#39;s taunts, Dadge began flying sideways. He raised both his arms and locked on the Wolf and the Harvenger. He put the Harvenger on Armor Piercing for now, mainly because her carapace certainly looked thick enough. He unloaded with both guns as he continued to shift his body weight, circling faster than ever. The Wolf knocked of significant chunks, but the AP ammo of the Harvenger seemed to bounce right off. The Queen screeched and swung with one of the arms, countering the trajectory of Dadge. Dadge hit the limb with all the force of her swing and all the speed of his flight. Dadge flew threw the air, spinning. This was especially bad due to the fact his jetpack went whichever way he was pointing. In other words, Dadge was being slung everywhere and had a headache to boot. <BR> <BR>Dadge finally cut off his pack, plummeting a bit, until he got his bearings. Once Dadge hit his pack again, he turned only to see the Queen charging him very quickly. Mouth open, Dadge was about to become to Queen&#39;s latest meal. He dodged to his left and the teeth came down on his right foot. Dadge tried to free himself, but it was to no avail. The 	Queen began to shake her head wildly, tossing Dadge around like a dog that found a rabbit. The Queen pulled her head quickly to her left, releasing Dadge and opening her mouth wide. To Dadge&#39;s amazement, his armor had protected his foot. This amazement quickly went to fear as Dadge realized what the Queen was doing. She realesed him so that his momentum would sling him right into the fanged maw of death. His packed slowed him some, but not enough compared to the fore she put behind her sling. Her jaw closed with lightning speed, and Dadge found himself in the mouth of the monster. He cut off his pack and looked around, a bit startled. He looked down towards the throat area, and realized where her stomach actually was. <BR> <BR>Her stomach was indeed at the back of her throat. Yet, that was not nearly as amazing as the fact she had loyal servants inside her titanic mouth. Each one was a small drone. They had massive arms, and were very much humanlike. They looked like assimilated Jill. No hair though, each looking like a deformed Jill without any marks of their lost heritage. They didn&#39;t even have skin. Dadge supposed they didn&#39;t really need it inside this place, nothing can harm them. Except Dadge of course. They were just putting a Jill child into this chamber of sorts. Several sacks lined the back of the mouth. Dadge guessed that these housed victims of the Swarm, for the Queens consumption. There were roughly ten of these sacks; each had to it its own Jill monstrosity. <BR> <BR>After the Jill child was put into the sac, probably to be digested, all of them turned and gazed at Dadge. Then, they all turned their heads to the Jill on the farthest end of the sacs. He opened the one on the end, and a Jill skeleton fell out into the mouth of the Queen. It was curled up, in a position of wretched pain. What flesh that was left on its face was contorted into a horrific form of a grimace. The ten fell on the skeleton with unbridled speed. They ripped and tore at the corpse. No doubt, they were fed by the Queen leftovers, and were probably reliant on calcium for a source of food. When they raised up, the only sign that a body was even there was the slight, melted residue on the ground. Now, they all looked at him, and he realized that they hadn&#39;t been hungry, they were only making room for one more morsel, Dadge. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh no, I don&#39;t even think so, you lost Jills ain&#39;t about to stuff me in that sack.&#34;  Dadge said as he backed up slightly. He raised his left arm, the Wolf-380, and aimed for the pack of them that was drawing steadily closer. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m warning you, I don&#39;t want to hurt any Jill in this little escapade.&#34; Alas, Dadge&#39;s words were merely a waste of breath. It pained him to see once proud Jill reduced to mindless servants of this defiling brood. <BR> <BR>&#34;In that case, I will release you, my friends.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, Dadge let off a single shot of his Wolf, right at the Jills. The explosion was a big one, but the Queen didn&#39;t seem to mind. Dadge noticed at this moment that the mouth was shaking a bit. He could hear screaming outside the mouth. His best bet was that the Jill army had been ordered to attack the Queen before she retreated. Yet, when he heard a child scream, he had a heart-wrenching realization. <BR> <BR>&#34;She&#39;s in the city.&#34; Dadge thought. He had to find a way out of her to save the Jill&#39;s city. <BR> <BR>Dadge couldn&#39;t put much more of this through his mind, as a massive hand protruded through the smoke filled area in front of him. The hand grasped his throat. As the smoke cleared, he saw that he only had killed three of the Jills, and the one holding his throat had only one arm. The one-armed Jill picked him up and began to carry Dadge towards the sac. Dadge trained the Wolf on the other disfigured Jills, who were gathered around another corpse, feasting. He fired off not one, but two of the U2 shells. The explosions were huge. Dadge would have shot the one holding him, except he would probably destroy himself in the process. So he opened up his Harvenger on his right hand. He pointed the end of the barrel at the shoulder joint of the massive Jill and let loose a volley of AP ammunition. The flesh about the bone splattered and flew, eventually working down to the bone itself. The bone chipped slowly, what can you expect for something that only eats calcium. Eventually, the bone shattered and the bullets flew into the bottom of the Queen&#39;s jaw. The mouth flew open, and Dadge saw that she was, indeed, in the city. She was destroying the Jill defenses. On top of that, an army of the swarm had fell on the city. Jill and Swarm types alike were dead in the streets. The fighting was heavy, but the Queen was indestructible. As Dadge pulled the arm off his throat, he turned and fired off one shot at the Jill, blasting its head off. The Jill fell dead, now there was no more. Dadge decided if he couldn&#39;t kill this thing, he could at least starve it to death. He shot the top part of one of the sacs. It busted revealing the Jill child, who was very much still alive. She coughed and gagged for air. Dadge knew if you could not last long in these sacs, the captives in the others were long since dead. Dadge blasted the remaining sacs with the Wolf. He took the Jill child up in his hands and went about finding a way out. He noted the holes in the bottom of its mouth, and remembered how it reacted when he shot it. If it felt the bullets, it has nerves, if it has nerves, it has feelings of pain, with feelings of pain, it must have a cerebrum, or a brain. He then concocted a half-baked idea that just might work. The wild card in this was the child. Dadge would only have one shot at this, so he had to do it fast. He couldn&#39;t leave her, and he wouldn&#39;t drop her. So she was just going to have to come along for the ride. <BR> <BR>Dadge stepped towards the backs of the massive teeth; the sounds of war still waging heavily outside. His headset had been long since broken, ever since the Queen nailed him in the head one good time. <BR> <BR>Dadge then whispered to the child, &#34;Now, you hang on, you hear? Everything will be alright.&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge pointed his Harvenger at the back of the beast&#39;s mouth, switching to Incendiary ammo. He let loose a massive number of shots into the back of the Queen&#39;s inner head. Her mouth opened wide and a tremendous scream of pain wailed forth. Dadge grasped the child with both hands as the force of the scream shot them out of her mouth. Dadge was now falling, back towards the ground, still clutching the child, refusing to let go. The Queen reared her head back in serious pain as she spewed fire with each roar. Dadge saw his opening. He hit his pack and, with the child in hand, charged forth towards the Queen&#39;s pivot point. He raised his Harvenger and switched over to the deadly Spark ammunition. He was going headfirst towards the creature&#39;s underbelly, right arm facing forwards. He then lets loose a stream of the little Spark bullets at the pivot point, where all four legs met. Dadge&#39;s thoughts had been simple. If it could feel pain, it had nerves, if it had nerves, it had a spinal cord. That seemed to be the most logical place for it. Connecting to all the legs and being able to sense pain in the mouth immediately. The bullet-heads exploded and chunks of the armored underside was slung off or left dangling from their lofty perch. The drill bits dug into the exposed flesh. The Queen fell from her reared position, landing back on all fours and some kind of ticked off. Dadge was still flying forwards, and now tried to stop himself. The Queen knew he was responsible for her pain and the death of her drones, and was infuriated. She opened her mouth, to reveal the scorching inferno Dadge had left in her mouth, and she was going to bite him in two. If the bite didn&#39;t kill him, the fire would. Dadge clasped around the little girl, to provide some protection for her. To him, his life was inconsequential to the life of another. Her teeth came slicing through the air like razors of the night wind, and right before they hit their mark, the Queen reared back again. She was shaking violently and Dadge realized that his hunch had been right. The minions that walked the streets screamed as the Queen was in torment. Had they all actually been one organism? The Queen fell on her back, and now Dadge could clearly see electricity coursing through the body as it twitched less and less each moment. Finally, it lay still, and all her minions were dead, too. The body lay in a position of torment that could only be achieved in death. The Jill child was crying, with good reason to. She had just had a very traumatic experience, but somehow Dadge knew she would be fine now… <BR> <BR> <BR>Everything was going to be just fine now… <BR> <BR>&#40;Enjoy, lets here some creative critics&#41;

 very nice sequence where dadge was looking a little &#34;down in the mouth&#34;. <BR> <BR>one quibble - slightly shorter paragraphs would help me follow the action a little better.
