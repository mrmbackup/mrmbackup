 The city of Monstria was awakened in the middle of the night. A crashing object sent a shockwave throughout, causing monsters of all kinds to leave their homes and see what the matter was. Chattering and questions were yelled about in total chaotic confusion. What had happened? They waited and waited, but an answer never came. After  getting tired of waiting, monsters began to return to their homes, deciding that there was nothing to worry about. However one monster did not cease question. His name was Convectus, King of all monsters. <BR> <BR>The pure Suezo that monsters all around called their king sat in his throne room, in silence. Suddenly through the huge entrance doorway, a Ragnarocks and Ripper appeared. The Ripper knealt and began to speak. <BR> <BR>&#34;Everyone has returned to their houses my leige. How should we proceed?&#34; the Ripper named Naharud asked. Convectus remained silent for a few moments, pondering the situation. At last he spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;I want you and Black Talon to investigate the perimeter of the crash site and report back to me.&#34; The Ragnarocks, Black Talon, began to object. <BR> <BR>&#34;But Convex, couldn&#39;t we have done that without waiting for the city to clear out?&#34; The king was used to these kind of questions, after all the two had been best friends since birth. In fact, they had been born together as their families were long time friends. <BR> <BR>&#34;I want to keep this quiet.&#34; Convectus replied. &#34;What-ever it is could be dangerous and I don&#39;t want to cause a panic if it is. The less my people know, the better.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Makes sense, I guess.&#34; the black dragon said under his breath. &#34;Not the way I woulda done it though.&#34; Convectus hated it when he talked like this. He had been jealous of his friend ever since he was chosen to be king instead of him 3 years ago. <BR> <BR>&#34;We shall do your bidding, sire.&#34; Naharud rose to a standing position. Convex laughed to hiself as the Ripper left the room.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Suck up&#34;he whispered to his Dragon freind. The two enjoyed a long laugh before the Ragnarocks followed the Ripper&#39;s path.
