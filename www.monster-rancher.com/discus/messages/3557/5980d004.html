 &#34;Bolt, hidden sting!&#34; <BR>The Renocraft dug its sting into the ground and waited. A few metres away stood a skiper.  It was a main breed hopper with a sub breed tiger.  It had a small horn and was eying the ground nervously.  Its trainer stood next to Kain.  He was only about thirteen and  was watching his skipper.   <BR>  &#34;wait for it Blue.&#34;  Said the boy.  &#34;Wait for it, now!&#34;   <BR>   The skipper jumped high into the air and straight at Bolt just as his sting came blasting through the ground.  Blue pulled back his long arm and flew closer and closer towards Bolt.  He landed on Bolt&#39;s face and continuosly flicked his tiny fists at it.  Bolt withdrew his sting from the ground and jumped backwards.  Blue fell to the floor and lost his balance.  He wavered for a split second and this gave Bolt time to jump with his pincers up. His claw assault hit dead on and Blue went flying on to his back.  The boy ran over and bandaged Blue up.   <BR>  &#34;Good game kid.&#34;  Said Kain happily. <BR>  The boy looked up at Kain.  He nodded and smiled then walked off towards the nearby town.  Kain gave Bolt an apple cake and he busily started to scramble at the skin.  They both walked over to the others.  The whole team were sat down at a small camp fire.  They had been travveling for a month and had fought many travveling monsters.  Kain sat down and listened to the others idoly talk.  Bolt slowly fell asleep as the dark red sky slowly changed to dark black.  Kain and the others looked up.  There were so many stars and planets.  There had to be life out there somewhere.  There was. Something stood in the sky.  He had knowledge of the universe.  It was he who had placed the discs around the planets making life forms such as himself.  He had a purpose in this.  His golden face had seen millenia go past.  <BR>  The next day Kain and the oters continued to travvel.  They were going to the next town called Gudos.  They wlaked at a steady pace and their monsters were all behind them except Houndine who was catching and returning a stick that Zack kept throwing.  Zack threw the stick into a river and four pairs of eyes watched him.  Houndine jumped into the river and looked for the stick.  He stopped and stuck his tail bolt upright.  Zack and the others stopped and watched him.  Zack looked around. <BR>  &#34;He can smell something.&#34;  He said, still turning from side to side.  There was a yelp and Houndine was thrown from the water.  It appeared to litterally pick him up and force him out.  Zack ran and grabbed Houndine as he fell to earth.  The tiger looked back at the water and his horns started to glow.  He jumped from Zacks arms and fired two solid lightning bolts into the water.  There was a huge splash as foue figers jumped out.  A liquid cube, Colourpandora sub breed Jell, a jelly saurian, Zuum sub breed Jell, a Gelatine, Moochi sub breed Jell and an aqua cutter, Naga sub breed Jell.  They all stood there on the ground and jumped at an individual human.  The colour pandora jumped straight at kain but Bolt got in its way.  It hit Bolts hard metal side and fell backwards.  Bolt tried to stamp on it but it kept seperating its body segments around Bolt&#39;s feet.  Its tail swung into Bolts side and knocked him back.  It jumped for Kain once more, there was a green flash and it exploded into jelled parts that settled in a sticky puddle.  Kain looked to Bolt who&#39;s claws were open and glowing. Meanwhile the others were battling the blue monsters.  Zea opened her hands and launched a mega ray that ripped the gelatine to shreds. Slowly the puddles oozed back into the river.  Mia looked around. <BR>  &#34;Is everyone Ok?&#34; She asked.  <BR>  &#34;Yep, I&#39;m fine, but i jumped out of my skin when they burst in on us like that.&#34;  Said Alex nodding.   <BR>  Scissora roared gently and everyone turned to look at her.  She was clawing the ground,  when she removed her claw their was a partially buried badge.  It was the sign of the battling monks.   <BR>  &#34;So they are still after us.&#34;  Said Zack looking around nervously.   <BR>  The rest of their journey to Gardos was uneventful.  When they got there however they were in for a huge shock.  The town was burining.  Flames were blasting a hundered feet into the air.  Dead bodies lined the streets and travvelers that had arrived since were desperately trying to put the flames out.  Kain ran up to a building as a man was pulled from the smoke.  He was tall and handsome but covered in smoky fumes and ash.  He coughed desperately and fell to his knees.  Mia was the first to speak. <BR>  &#34;What happened here?&#34;  She asked in a concerned voice as she looked up at the towering inferno.  The man coughed and spluttered.   <BR>  &#34;Men and women with monsters.  They came and torched the city.  Anyone who tried to run was killed instantly.  The men were all bald and they were wearing robes with a symbol on the front, it was like a.&#34;  Then the man stopped, coughed and died.  Alex turned her face away and closed her eyes.  Zack stood up,  his fists were clenched.   <BR>  &#34;<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> it! They knew we were coming here.  They burned this city just because we were on our way here!  Thats it, we are gonna find these monks and kill all of them!&#34;  He turned to face Mia and Kain, then Alex who had finally opened her eyes.  They all looked at the monsters.  They were despereately trying to shake fallen monsters awake.  They returned upset and angry.  Zea opened her mouth then closed it again.   <BR>  &#34;We get men who hurted monster and person place!&#34;  Bolt and Scissora nodded and Houndine jumped up and scratched the air. <BR>  They stayed for a few days.  There were a couple of survivors but not many.  They hekped ckean up the town slightly as it fell to dust.  Then the team continued.  They walked in no particullar direction, just the way they had planned to go.  The monks trained in the mountains.  The mountiains were large and their tips were carpetted in white snow.  Kain and the others got their in four months.  They had bough warm clothing and food from the nearsest town and set out to climb the first mountain.  Kain and Alex got to the base of it first and looked up.  It towered miles into the sky and the path was windy.  They climbed further and further up.  They met no one as it got colder and colder.  They had been walking for three weeks when they hit snow.  It was thick ad dry and made it even harder to walk.  Bolt was begining to freeze.  Zea was not doing well either.  The travvelers walked slowly up and up.  The air became thin and Kain noticed that they had slowed their pace.  Thats when Zack saw it.  A golden light.  They had just climbed up a peak and had reached the top.  They could see just along the way a  shining gold steeple.  <BR>  &#34;This could be it&#34; Said Mia as they set downwards into the valley.  The steeple could be seen all the way down and after about a days worth of walking they reached the temple door.  It was huge and wooden but layed open.  Inside it was warm.  Warmer than the travvelers had been for weeks.  They looked around and Bolt started to wake up.  Their senses came back and they realised this was the place where they could fight a whole horde of enemies.  They quickly hid behind a statue and talked. <BR>  &#34;Lets burst into that room and suprise them.  The longer we wait the more likely they are of finding us.&#34;   Said Mia. <BR>  The team agreed.  They waited by the door and got ready to pounce through.  Bolt stood at the front and bent his legs.   <BR>  &#34;Now!&#34; Shouted Zack.  Bolt smashed a hole in the door with his pinsir then pushed it wide open.  There were several monks inside and about three monsters.  The monks paniked and ran in all directions.  Scissora and Houndine launched a few random fire balls and bolts of lightning while Zea and Bolt jumped around breaking statues.  A bald man burst through the door and was nearly swamped by running monks.  His clothes looked the same as the regular monks but were more elaborate.  He stood there with a sohere of light in his hand.  He laughed evily then stared at the travvelers. <BR>  &#34;So i do beleive you are the IMA competetors.  You managed to unravvel our plan did you.  Well My name is Senth and I am head battling monk.  There is only one God.  He is our God.  He has no form and he cannot show himself in any way.&#34; <BR>  There was a crushing noice.  It started quitely but got louder and louder.  The travvlers and Senth looked up.  The roof was being torn off the building.  Masonry crumbled and fell and lights and statues were torn apart.  A voice boomd out over the room. <BR>  &#34;YOU ARE WRONG!&#34;  The roof was lifted and there was a hand.  It was white and ghost like.  It was tiny.  The size of a mans but still could lift the entire temple roof.  Senth looked up at the hand and screemed.  The hand slowly lowered the roof to the ground outside and a form was revealed.  A golden face with spikes on its plated surface.  A long golden cape.  The gali sunk down into the temple.   <BR>  &#34;I AM THE ONLY GOD!&#34;  The mask boomed. <BR>Senth laughed angrily.   <BR>  &#34;You are nothing but a regular Gali!&#34; <BR>The gali turned to him and the mask began ti spin.  Senth disappeared fromt he spot.  He didn&#39;t reappear. <BR>  &#34;DOES THAT LOOK LIKE A REGULAR ATTACK TO YOU?&#34;  It shouted.  &#34;NOW I SHALL DESTROY YOU!  YOU SHALL FEEL MY FORCE!&#34;  It dived at the team and all of them closed their eyes.  Their was the sound of something hitting a douvet.  They opened their eyes.  Kain saw a deep black wall.  There was the indent of a mask in it.  The Monol stepped sideways as the gali fell back. <BR>  &#34;THERE WERE TWO GODS, NOT JUST ONE!  I AM THE ORIGINAL, I AM THE FIRST, YOU ARE BUT A COPY!&#34;  The monol grew a face as he spoke these words.  The mask smiled evily. <BR>  &#34;YES, BUT YOU CANNOT KILL ME! YOU CANNOT EVEN MOVE ME.  IT WOULD BE LIKE SUICIDE!&#34;  He hissed.  The Monol seemed to consider this then looked at the travvlers. <BR>  &#34;NO BUT THEY CAN!&#34;  The monol just finished the sentance then dived at the gali.  He hit him and light burst out in all directions.  Slowly the  two figuires melted into one.  The form of  a human was took on.  It was a magic monster.  They were very rare in FIMBA and non existant on IMA.  The Magic smiled wickedly. <BR>  &#34;I am destiny!&#34;  It cried then jumped into the air.  It landed a kick on Zea and she went flying into Alex.  Zack stood angrily.  Then he whistled.  Houndine dived forward and dug his horns into the magic.  The magic did not seem to beseriously injured but still fell back. <BR>  &#34;Ok lets get him!&#34;  Shouted Zack. <BR>Bolt, Zea, Houndine and Scissora all droce forward.  Bolt opened his claws and tiny balls of light began to form in each one.  They fired off green lazer shots that just missed the monster.  Magic jumped and opened his arms.  Lightning forced its way at Zea who flew past it.  As the magic came down to land Scissora opened her mouth and fired a flame ball.  It hit Magic in the arm and knocked him over.  He sprang back up laughing.  He spread his arms out and coated his fists in green energy.  He ran at Scissora and punched several times.  Green lazers cut their way through her scales and she let out a scream of pain.  She pulled her tail up in the air and swung it at Magic.  It hit it in the face and Magic stuttered backwards.  Houdine attacked with combination and landed four succesful hits on it.  Magic fell to the floor and Bolt stepped next to it.  The others gathered around in a circle. <BR>  &#34;Ready!&#34;  Kain shouted. <BR>  &#34;Aim!&#34;  Shouted Alex and Mia. <BR>  Balls of light appeared in Bolt&#39;s claws, Zeas hands were clenched but blue light was escaping, Houndine&#39;s horns had electricity surging through them and Scissora&#39;s mouth had a tongue of flame forming. <BR>  &#34;Fire!&#34;  Yelled Zack. <BR>Four powerful attacks hit magic square on.  He glowed many colours then exploded.  The gali lay unconciues on the floor.  The monol was standing.   <BR>  &#34;THANKYOU TRAVVELERS.  YOUR EFFORTS WILL BE HIGHLY APRREICIATED.  NOW I CAN MAKE THIS GALI GOOD NATURED ONCE MORE.  IT ONLY TAKES BELEIF TO TURN A GOD BAD OR GOOD NATURED.  NOW WATCH!&#34;  The Monol&#39;s voice was strong.  He jumped into the air and ifred a bright white lazer from his chest.  It hit Gali and slowly faded.  Gali woke up and smiled.  He did not say a word as he rose into the air and hovered outside the temple.  Monol Slowly dissolved without a word.  Gali picked the travellers up in his hand and placed them outside the temple.  He slammed his fist on the building destroying what was left.  Then he winked at the team and they were back at the mountains base.   <BR>  Kain and Mia were having a mock battle when Zack walked over.   <BR>  &#34;Where do you think the monks went?&#34;  He asked solomly.   <BR>  &#34;Who knows? maybe they set up a new temple.  Even if they did i doubt they will beach much problem.&#34;  Said Mia happily as Scissora launched a slow bite on Bolts leg.  The travvelers were walking onwards threw FIMBA.  Kain tripped on something and fell to the floor.  The other laughed at him except for Bolt who looked concerned.  He reached to the ground and saw a brown lump.  He pulled it out and saw it was a disk stone.  He kept it in his bag.  Kain knew it would have its use. <BR> <BR>Thats the secons part of the Kain saga.  I don&#39;t like it as much as the first but oh well.  Have the next part up before Monday.
