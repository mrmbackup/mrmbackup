 Hey guys. Here&#39;s the next part. I hope you enjoy in the midst of all of this MR4 excitement! <BR> <BR> <BR>It seems that Hannah has some tough times ahead of her. Now, let us turn our attention to Kari, one of the two Soul Masters left. <BR> <BR>It was bleak and stormy winter day. You know, one of those days where it’s just better to stay inside, sit by the fire, and drink hot chocolate while reading your favorite book. The roads were empty and uninviting, but there was one person was daring the storm. Her and her two monsters: a Ripper and a Madillo. They came upon and small town, and found an even smaller inn.  <BR> <BR>The Merry Mocchi was a small inn, and that’s using the word lightly. Walking in, you would see the innkeeper’s table next to a hearth that had a roaring fire going, which was a welcome sight for our three travelers. To the right was a small bar where there was a burly redheaded man. To the right was a staircase leading up the rooms, which were small as well. <BR> <BR>The traveler strode over the innkeeper. He was short himself. He has buzzed blonde hair, and wore geek-like clothes. “How much for a night?” she asked him. <BR> <BR>“Oh, hi there, Dollface. The rooms are usually 500 gold, but for you, it’ll be 250?” <BR> <BR>“Thank you.” Her face was calm, but it soon changed, “Oh! And if you EVER call me Dollface again, I will have Ice Queen over here,” she pointed to the Ripper, “I will allow her to tear your left eye out and serve it on a silver platter to that huge gentleman over there! Is that OK for you?” <BR> <BR>“Uh, yeah, sure, Dol- I mean Ma’am.” This got through to him. “Your room is number 5. Please, help yourself to the bar….it’s complementary!” now he was just trying to save face. <BR> <BR>“Thanks,” said the traveler as she walked over to the bar, ordered a drink, and sat down next to the large, burly man. <BR> <BR>“Ack! Yoo sure ‘ave a way weeth words, lassy!” <BR> <BR>“What? Oh, that. I was just teaching that little man some manners.” A smile had formed across her face. The kind of smile you get when meeting an old friend. <BR> <BR>“So, lassy, what brangs yoo to this par’ ‘o the country. Eet’s poorin’ outside. Good ta be oot of tha rain, eh?” <BR> <BR>“Yes, I’m very glad to have me and my monsters inside. As for my reason for being here, I have a job for a certain mercenary named Shamus McSkyburg. . It’s not so much a mercenary job, but more of a bodyguard job. Are you interested?” <BR> <BR>“Weel…noot at the moment. Yeh see, I’m tryin; tah cut back on the whol mercenary thang. Ta teel the truth, I’m getting’ too old fer thah sort of thang. Mah bones just cannah take it.” He made as if he had pain when he moved. He wasn’t a very good actor. <BR> <BR>“Just like the Shamus I know, lazy as ever. I think you’ll go when you hear the conditions AND the price.” <BR> <BR>“Go on. I’m listnin’.” <BR> <BR>“All you have to do is watch the merchant’s road that goes from Ixin to Hyander, and look for a boy with a Gitan and an Ogyo. Oh! Don’t give me that confused look. You know what kind of monsters those are, even if they’re rare. The fee will be twice your usual.” <BR> <BR>“Ooh! Then I guees I’ll ‘ave tah accept.” Then something donned on him. “Wait a minute. Why am I getting’ paid double fer noot much wark? Is there soomthang special aboot thees kid?” <BR> <BR>“Well,” he voice had severely hushed, “from what I can gather, he is one of the last remaining Soul Masters. Jacques is looking for him as we speak.” <BR> <BR>“Are yoo sure? I thought tha’ tha; Keerstin garl was the Gitan and Ogyo Soul Master. <BR> <BR>“Nope, she was a fake, holding out I don’t know how long. Thank heavens that Jacques found out about James, that’s the boy’s name, as late as he did, or I would have never gotten to him.” <BR> <BR>“So, yoo want meh too protect him until he gets to Hyander. Wot’s ‘e gonna do then?” <BR> <BR>“A large group of mercenaries have been hired to help him on the rest of the way. Knowing how you like to work alone, I thought of giving you this job. What do you say, will you help me, old friend?” <BR> <BR>“Ack! How can I say no tah a face like that…so pitiful!” He laughed aloud and Kari made quite a sour face. “Yeah, I’ll doo eet. When do I start off?” <BR> <BR>“Right now, if you would. He should be nearing Ben’s forest by now. I hope he isn’t stupid enough to go in there. It’s a real pity what happened to him, but we must remember, it was done for the good of all.” There was a long silence, which was finally broken by a nudge from Kari’s Madillo, Percy. “Ah, thank you, Percy. I believe we have to be going now. I’m so sorry to be off so soon. Farewell, old friend,” and in a flash, she was gone. <BR> <BR>“Ack! I doon’t think I’ll ever be used tah that teleportation thang she does. Oh well, it’s a cold night. I think I’ll start off in a morning. Horatio could use a good work out.” He let out chuckle and returned to his drink by the fire.
