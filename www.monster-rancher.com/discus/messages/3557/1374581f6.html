 &#39;Pixies?&#39; Gunt asked in disbelief, &#39;yes&#39; replied Trana impatiently &#39;we wish to stay a night&#39; she jingled her purse as a sign of impatience. Gunt grumbled as he let them in and led them to administration. &#39;these girls wish to stay for a night&#39; Gunt explained as the administrator observed Trana and her friends hungrily &#39;oh yes, one night accommodation and food in the morning will be 300g&#39; the administrator told the pixies as Gunt returned to his stool at the door to the inn, &#39;here you are sir&#39; said Trana&#39;s younger sister Lirna as she gave the administrator the money for the nights stay, ‘thank you young lady’ he said as he accepted the money for their stay. ‘Here is the key for your room. Oi! Kuin, escort these girls to room 37 please’ Kuin was a durahan working for The Red Sword inn which his owner ran. Kuin looked the sisters up and down and finally replied ‘ok Juin, come on girls lets go’ Kuin led them through several passages and twists and finally they arrived at their room, the whole way Vauna was watching Kuin with interest until they got to their room when Vauna asked Kuin to meet her down in the common room in 3 hours to ‘talk’. When the girls had gone to sleep which wasn’t very long indeed, Vauna snuck out to meet Kuin in the common room the only problem was finding her way back but that wasn’t hard as she followed the door number until she came upon the common room and a very nervous Kuin, ‘hi Kuin’ Vauna said as she walked to the fireplace where Kuin was waiting, ‘hey Vauna you came’ he replied anxiously, Vauna as with most of her friends is a mia. Vauna was prettier than the others thought Kuin dreamily, ‘do you want to get a drink’ he asked tentatively though Vauna didn’t see it ‘sure’ she replied steadily as they walked over to the bar a drunk and unusually big garu slapped Vauna on the behind Kuin saw this and growled at the garu angrily ‘I don’t think she likes that’ the garu slurs ‘whadda ya gunna do about it’ Kuin replied quietly: ‘if you do it again you will regret it’ the garu looked as if he was going to retaliate but he thought better and fell silent. Kuin and Vauna made their way to the bar with no more interruptions Vauna ordered a star prune juice and Kuin went with nuts oil mixed with powder they drank with much conversation, ‘so Vauna, where are you and your friends off to anyway?’ Kuin asked ‘we are going to look for the legendary wolf eagle I have no doubt you have heard of it?’ she replied darkly, Kuin seeing the darkness on her face he replied of course I have I was planning to look for it as well, maybe we can travel together’ they were so wrapped up in their conversation they forgot the time Vauna suddenly grabbed her watch and gave a gasp, ‘its almost midnight I have to go or I will get no sleep, are you coming Kuin?’ ‘Sure’ he replied slightly sad she had to go so soon on their way back to the corridor leading to the rooms the big garu slapped Vauna’s behind again Kuin suddenly used a triple slash on the garu enraged the garu jumped at Kuin easily dodging he used a flash slash the garu collapsed unconscious ‘he deserved it’ Kuin said disgusted. Vauna surprised at this show of power swung her arms around Kuin’s neck and gave him a big kiss, Kuin staggered surprised then realized ‘oh’ was all he said and he blushed ‘bye said Vauna ‘see ya tomorrow’ Kuin replied still dazed. As Vauna made her way back to her room she could think only of Kuin. He is handsome she thought dreamily the only thing she dreamed about as she slept soundly in her bed, was Kuin. <BR> <BR> <BR>‘Vauna, get up its morning’ Vauna heard as she woke to find her friends already dressed and ready to go to the common room. Vauna leapt out of bed and begun getting dressed, after she was dressed she walked out the door with her friends to go eat some food, when they got down there they decided to eat some mango and some fish. Jona was quietly watching a jell with interest, when the jell noticed out of the corner of his eye that a pixie was watching him the jells name was Juan he had some past experiences with strong monsters but the power resonating from this pixie was immense he decided to talk to her, as he got up and began blobbing over, Jona got nervous and when the jell got to Jona&#39;s table she was as nervous as a garu beginning school, the jell suddenly sat at the table and said ‘hi’, the pixies’ replied with ‘hi’ in exactly the same enthusiasm but Jona stuttered when she greeted him. Jona struck up conversation with Juan, ‘my n-name is j-j-Jona what’s y-yours?’ she asked, slowly regaining her composure ‘my name’s Juan son of Capella’ just as they were beginning to warm to each other they heard whooshing of cloaks and saw five Gali police officers burst into the common room, the head officer said to the pixies’ as Kuin joined them to protect them, ‘you are under arrest for the abuse of Lanity Yuntas, he was at this bar last night drinking after work when a Durahan and a Pixie  attacked him as you are the only ones in the bar which fits the description, you will be charged with attempted bash’ Vauna looked in surprise at Kuin but his face was clouded with a dark look. Kuin knew the punishment of attempted bash and he knew they wouldn’t stand a chance in court.  <BR> <BR>                                                           <BR>                                                             To be continued…..

 Very good foxman. Nice story overall. The only thing I could point out would be that when you start a new paragraph, don&#39;t indent, press enter twice. If you don&#39;t it will be all jumbled up like this &#40;I think we&#39;ve all went through this one.&#41;. Also when someone else speaks, start a new paragraph. Story wise though, it was great.

 thanks, there was some parts of the story that monster rancher metropolis didnt catch like some of the techs Kuin used were supposed to be in italiano and some speech marks it didnt pick up was kind of a bummer, but im writing the new one so it should be posted in a few days.

 Sorry, Foxman. I haden&#39;t seen this until now. Great story! I see that Vauna and Kuin have a &#39;thing&#39; going on. The only problem that I could see was that you could use some more punctuation. That was my only trouble. Otherwise, great story. I will read the next one.
