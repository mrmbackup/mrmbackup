 The desert is hot during the day, but just as cold during the night. Hannah and Julius were frozen solid on the back of a Beaklon, flying for their lives. Not your peaceful night in the desert, is it?  <BR> <BR>“H-h-how m-m-m-much long-g-g-ger?” Hannah asked, shivering violently. <BR> <BR>“N-n-not f-f-f-f-far. We sh-sh-should get t-t-to the Go-go-goat Sea in about an hou-hou-hour.” Julius was just as cold as Hannah. “Their h-h-h-having a t-t-t-tournament there tomorrow. W-w-we need s-s-some funds.” Hannah gave him a puzzled look. <BR> <BR>“Why? D-d-d-don’t we n-n-need to hide, o-o-or something?” <BR> <BR>“No” said Julius proudly, “w-w-were going af-af-af-after this Th-third Soul thing. You kn-kn-know the way r-r-right? I’ve heard about wh-what the bosses are s-s-saying. We n-n-need to f-find it first.” <BR> <BR>“I g-guess your right. Oh, look! The s-s-sun has risen. It should get w-warmer pretty soon.” <BR> <BR>“’S a good thing th-th-that we are close to Goat, ‘cause it gets hot pretty quick in the desert.” <BR> <BR>“Yeah…”There was a long silence. All that could be heard was the incessant hum of the Beaklon’s wings and the low banter of Hannah’s monsters. The Goat see could be seen on the horizon. It took a while, but finally, Hannah mustered up enough courage to ask a question that had been eating at her ever since they has left the prison. “Julius” <BR> <BR>“Yes, Miss?” <BR> <BR>“How was it,” she paused for a bit, but continued, “that you got mixed up in all of that crap?” <BR> <BR>“Well, it’s quite complicated—“ <BR> <BR>“I knew I shouldn’t have asked, sorry, a thousand times sorry!” she hung her head. <BR> <BR>“No, it’s OK. I probably should tell you anyway. You see, my parents weren’t very wealthy, and a lot of the times, the only way I could eat was to steal. I had gotten pretty good at it and my sticky fingers could lift anything, until I got caught. Some cops picked me up while I was trying to get some food for dinner. I was tried and convicted. I thought I was going to go to jail. I didn’t, though. One of the judges at the court decided to take me as a servant for my crimes. I had a choice: go to jail, or serve time as a servant to this man. I took the obvious choice and became his servant. This man was Duwanee. I was supposed to only work for five months, but when that was up, he offered me a job. As you can imagine, I took it in an instant. Over the years, I grew to love this man, and he treated me almost as a son. <BR> <BR>Recently, he had been gone a lot. I asked why. I first thought that he was gonna hit me, with that look on his face, but then it changed. He took me to the compound in the desert. I was amazed, but also a bit scared. ‘What could he be planning with all these men, equipment, and monsters?’ I thought to myself. He then offered me a job as one of the head soldiers. Normally, I would have refused, but his payment offer was HUGE, so I accepted. My first task, be your guard. Things happened, and now I am where I am today.” <BR> <BR>“Oh, I,” Hannah was at a loss for words. “I just always imagined those soldiers back there as mindless, evil thugs that—“ <BR> <BR>“And your right, most of them are.” He thought for a minute and said, “You know what, I’m glad to be out of that place! I feel a giant relief taken off my back; Angelo, too. Don’tcha boy?” Angelo let out a loud, happy grunt. He then signaled that they had arrived. “Ah, the Goat Sea. I went there once when traveling with Duwanee. It’s amazing. The monsters can breathe underwater!” <BR> <BR>“Really?” Hannah already knew this, being a scholar and all, but she didn’t want to spoil his spirit. “How sure are you about us winning this tournament?” <BR> <BR>“It should be fairly easy. As long as the tournament isn’t held underwater you should whip the floor with the competition.” He seemed quite confident. <BR> <BR>“What do you mean underwater?! I thought that they only trained underwater here!” Hannah was beginning to panic. <BR> <BR>“It’s a local thing. They like to fight under water, so as to throw off the foreign competition; and you call yourself a scholar.”  <BR> <BR>“Well—I—uh,” Hannah was beginning to blush.  <BR> <BR>“Let’s hope that you monsters can hold,” <BR> <BR>“Oh, don’t worry about that, they’ll hold…they have to.” <BR> <BR> <BR>Here you all are, enjoy.

 I know, I know, it&#39;s way too short, I&#39;m working in it, really I am. I&#39;m just glad someone is reading it. My older ones were twice as long. Right now I am in a major transition and the next one will be longer. In fact, I am working on it right now <BR> <BR>&#42;Spoiler&#42; <BR> <BR>There&#39;s gonna be a few suprises at the Goat Tournament.

 If you have trouble with length, revise for details. If you add better descriptions with better, longer adjectives, your work will come out long enough to hook the reader into your plot.
