The Journey of the Jells  <BR> <BR>Chapter Eleven:The Bad, the Badder, the  <BR>Worst <BR> <BR>	The Phoenix and Mr.Freeze looked down at  <BR>the forest and the villages.  It was clear they  <BR>were being shot at. They just didn’t see how  <BR>they were shooting from about four different  <BR>directions.   <BR>	“Don’t worry, Freeze, we’ll mak--AHHHHH!!”  <BR>the Phoenix screamed in agony.  <BR>	By some amazing stroke of luck,  a Beam  <BR>Gun had made it’s way toward him just as a  <BR>misfired bullet went in front of it, and the Beam  <BR>Gun had knocked the bullet straight into the  <BR>heart of the Phoenix.  The Phoenix and  <BR>Mr.Freeze plummeted to the ground. <BR> <BR>					&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>	Minion stared at the falling body.  He saw the  <BR>Phoenix and the Jell separate in the air, the  <BR>Jell fall with a sickening crack, and the  <BR>Phoenix die in the air.  It was over. Scorpio  <BR>cheered.  Everybody looked stunned. It was  <BR>over.  The Jells had won the war. <BR> <BR>					&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>	Otto looked out the window and saw Burner  <BR>die.  He smiled.  <I>I bet everyone’s thinking  <BR>it’s over.  Far from it.</I> <BR>	The evil Automaton took out a bottle of green  <BR>liquid--and he poured it all over the dead  <BR>troops.  Then he sat back and watched with  <BR>glee.  Every monster that was dead now  <BR>wasn’t.  In fact, the only thing they could do  <BR>was obey him, and that would be the end of  <BR>the ‘good’ guys.  We’ll see...we’ll see. <BR> <BR> <BR>				&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>				<B>Two Weeks Later...</B> <BR> <BR>	Minion stepped up to the podium.  The  <BR>audience and the seven billion people that  <BR>were watching on T.V. stood up and gave him  <BR>the applause he deserved.  He responded  <BR>with a thank you and the usual “I’d like to thank  <BR>my wife for being there for me, also I want to  <BR>thank my girlfriend for being there for me.”   <BR>Scratch that.  What he really said was “I’d like  <BR>to thank God, because without Him we  <BR>wouldn’t be here and we wouldn’t have made  <BR>it.  I am also going to thank my friends for  <BR>being there.” <BR>	The president of FIMBA smiled.  “Thank you,  <BR>Minion.  And now, the next person who will  <BR>recieve the Medal of Honor--Baxter!” <BR>	Baxter hastily jumped up on the stage,  <BR>pushed pass the president, and came to the  <BR>mic.   <BR>	“WehavetofindGengen. I know what he’s  <BR>going to do!” <BR>	A murmer went through the crowd.  Then a  <BR>Kato jumped out of the crowd and took  <BR>something from inside Baxter. A green  <BR>glowing orb.  Baxter gasped, then crumpled  <BR>and fell off the stage.  The Kato jumped out the  <BR>window to the waiting helicopter.  Baxter’s  <BR>special orb--the orb that Jells have inside-- <BR>was missing and the body was useless  <BR>without it.  The orb contained Baxter--this was  <BR>just his body.  Minion stared.  <I>”No.”</I> <BR>	A piece of paper floated down to the FIMBA  <BR>president.   It said: <BR>“<I>Baxter is MY friend...not yours. Don’t stick  <BR>your ugly nose where it don’t belong!</I>” <BR> <BR>This was more of a plot builder than anything  <BR>else.

 I know it&#39;s short, but hey, everybody&#39;s gotta  <BR>have a plot builder, right?

 Yup yup. I think me and BR had at least one in our stories. Still sad that Burner is dead so quickly.

 Who says hes officialy dead?  Its really not a  <BR>shame,even if I decided to really kill him &#40;and I  <BR>just might leave him dead&#41;.  If you liked  <BR>Burner, you&#39;ll LOVE Flame, though.  Just hold  <BR>on and hope.  And it would be a never ending  <BR>story if Burner lived forever...I like to change  <BR>things around.

 Nothing wrong with a plot builder, or two, or three! If the story calls for some setting up, do so. I do think this chapter moved too quickly though.
