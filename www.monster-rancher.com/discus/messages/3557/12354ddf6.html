 I&#39;ve read about this type of thing happening eventually, which is unpreventable. If you become paranoid about these kind of these things then please beware.  <BR> <BR>---  <BR> <BR>The warm August sun blistered down on the men working under it. The Texas heat gave no mercy as it pounded 98 degrees of pure skin weltering heat. The year was 2018 and the last bit of oil was being drilled from the hard and barren ground. Three men worked at the oil rig at this time of day. It was later so the heat wouldn’t as bad as it is in the day time. The men worked the drill diligently into the ground as it ripped up dirt, rocks and other worthless items. They drilled for about 20 minutes and then took a break. They had managed to drill about 50 yards.  <BR> <BR>“It’s useless, there’s no more oil in this world.” A man said grimly as he ripped sweat from his dirty forehead. “No matter what President Johnstone says there is nothing left.”  <BR> <BR>“What are we going to do?” Another man asks as he removes his gloves just to reveal a bunch of blood blisters on his rugged hands.  <BR> <BR>“Nothing, Jason. We are just going to watch our economy go crazy and prices for the remaining oil sky rocket to thousands of dollars just for half a barrel.”  <BR> <BR>“Can’t we just find another source of power, Rick?” Jason asked frantically as his eyes widen. Praying for a new hope.  <BR> <BR>“No, that would require more oil. We don’t have enough left.” Rick said as he set his gloves on the ground and walked to his pickup truck.  <BR> <BR>“You can’t just expect to drive off!” Jason said running after him as Rick set his key in the ignition.  <BR> <BR>“Why not?” Rick asked irritated. <BR> <BR>“That would use oil!” Jason exclaimed as he tried to stop the man from turning the car on.  <BR> <BR>“What will this matter? We can’t conserve anymore. We should of thought about this long ago.” Rick said in a harsh tone as he slammed the door in Jason’s face and drove off.  <BR> <BR>Later that night Rick climbed out of his car and walked to his apartment door in Austin, 80 miles away from his work place. He turned the door handle and walked in and sat down. He thumbed around underneath his couch trying to find the remote control. He maneuvered his hands through potato chips and lint as he came up with the remote. He turned on the television and began to watch his favorite program, which was a sports station. The show had ended and Rick decided to watch the news before he’d get something to eat and take a shower. A few minutes went by with the usual, someone was shot, a bank got robbed, someone famous died. Then a short announcement was made about oil. The lady softly cleared her throat and said.  <BR> <BR>“Well, if you bought gas today I think that would be the best thing. If not, then you’re out of luck. Gas stations will be raising their prices per gallon by 50 dollars. Only expect it to increase as we’ve found out that there is no more oil left in our country. The oil reserves as gone. So please, think about going somewhere before you drive off.”  <BR> <BR>Rick stood up and slowly waddled over to his refrigerator and pulled out a frozen pizza. He put it in the microwave and began to ponder the thoughts. He was a well educated man and knew that this could be the worse thing for America. He was day dreaming about all the possible outcomes. Maybe a country is holding off and not revealing that they in fact have an oil reserve left.  <BR> <BR>The beeping of the microwave brought him back to real world thought. He pulled out the slice of pizza which sizzled on the plate. He picked the pepperonis off and ate them individually then ate the pizza. He climbed into the shower and washed himself as the water beneath him turned brown from all the dirt being removed from his body.  <BR> <BR>He climbed out of the shower once more and dried off his body and wobbled over to his couch and lay down. He pulled a blanket over his worn and battered body and quickly fell asleep. The next day he had woke up and gotten a phone call. From his boss, telling him he was now unemployed, without any oil to dig up he would now have to reason to be hired. He kept receiving phone calls from the Gas Company, the Air Conditioning Company and Electricity Company receiving news that the prices will be raised just so they can afford to keep their own companies running.   <BR> <BR>He sighed and turned on the television. The stock market was in great trouble, prices for simple things have been raised by lots of money. One instance said that socks now cost forty dollars a pair. Then it was announced that America had declared war on all Middle Eastern countries.  <BR> <BR>---  <BR> <BR>This is just an introduction for the whole story, expect the other chapters longer.

 Very well written, GG! I am impressed. <BR> <BR>A few slips in thought process &#40;i.e. the last paragraph&#41; were evident. <BR> <BR>BUT your word usage, syntax, adjective increase and excellent descriptions of people and settings truly has elevated you much higher than you have ever written in my eyes. <BR> <BR>Although, I can honestly say I&#39;m not eagerly awaiting the next installment, simply because I know better, and it doesn&#39;t appeal to me. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll just have to trust me, there are several other energy resources either complete and paid to be quiet for now, or in the process of making breakthroughs, to then be paid off to be quiet for now. <BR> <BR>Human nature is inescapable. <BR> <BR>With another resounding BUT, I DO look forward to ANYTHING you write from here on out. <BR> <BR>All Hail GG! <BR> <BR>&#40;Oh, and I&#39;m from Texas, stationed in Alaska, I promise you the last bit of oil will more than likely be in Alaska :P &#41;

 Well, you see. We use oil alot and especially in the US. If we wanted to use other sources of energy we&#39;d have to use oil in the process. Like electric cars. They would have to be made, correct? What do we use currently to make other things? You got it, oil. Solar power is also undependable just because of the fact, the sun isn&#39;t always out, and it takes more oil to build things like windmills then it does to actually power the windmills.  <BR> <BR>Believe me. I know what I&#39;m talking about this time.

 If I told you that, in 50 years, dogs would rule the world and we&#39;d be fighting an underground rebellion alongside all of cat-kind for the freedom of the world, would you believe me? <BR> <BR>Of course not. <BR> <BR>Now, are you telling me that if I, indeed, put forth the effort to beautify this outlandish claim to the point of cultism and creatively ingénue mysterious yet plausible causes for my beliefs that can&#39;t be disproven by simple logical thought processes? <BR> <BR>If anyone can, I can. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t believe everything you hear. That is why Micheal Moore has made 100 million bucks while telling us how wonderful the Middle Eastern Countries truly are. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s another rant altogether. Like I said, great piece of work for just that, I just don&#39;t bite into things I hear, especially when I know better from facts &#40;read above paragraph&#41;. <BR> <BR>Oh, and anyone I scared, dogs can&#39;t rule the world because they have no opposable thumbs, and France doesn&#39;t have enough firepower/manpower/guts. &#40;Think about it.&#41;

 He did a really good job with this. <BR> <BR>All I was saying is that I can&#39;t bite off on something I personally &#40;as my opinion&#41; find outlandish at its most convincing. <BR> <BR>GG did a great job writing it though. The only problem I have is the sentences. I would like to see more commas, fewer periods. In extending thoughts in single, longer sentences, instead of breaking them into several, short and choppy ideas.
