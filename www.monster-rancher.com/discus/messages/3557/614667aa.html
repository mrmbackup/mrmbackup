 Kain stood on a hill in side the silver ship.  The inside had been made to look like a plain or field. A heard of jells were mock fighting each other and training.  Kain concentrated on a pair below him.  One was a green jell with scales running around his head and base.  The other was grey and granity.  They were battling fiercely amongst the others and had been going for some time.  The green jell was continually whipping the rocky one with its tentacles.  The wall mimic was defending himself behind a shield made from his arm.  Suddenly he sunk into the ground and slithered around the scaled one.  Kain watched as the rocky puddle reformed behind the green monster and a whip of spikes forced its way through its body.  The scaled jell fell to the floor and the wall mimic helped him up.  Kain loved watching the strong monsters battle.  They had so many attacks and had learnt to improvise during battle and make attacks out of nothing.  Kain returned to the house area of the ship where himself, Lisa, Zack and Deranracnier eat, slept and planned their day.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey Detanracnier, Lisa.&#34;  Kain said as the automatic doors opened and he walked in.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Please, stop calling me that, call me Detan.&#34;  Detanracnier.  &#34;Its my nick name.&#34; <BR> <BR>They had lunch, although the other monsters fed themselves from troughs when ever they grew hungry, Detan allowed the three of their monsters to eat with them, at least for the time being. Half way through lunch the whole ship was flooded with red and orange light.  Detan ran out of the room and then returned beckoning the others.  They ran through now empty fields to a part of the ranch.  There was a circular pod lying in the grass and smoldering.  <BR> <BR>&#34;We&#39;ve been boarded!&#34;  Said Detan  <BR> <BR>The pod slowly hissed then a door fell to the ground.  It made a ramp to the floor like a cross bridge.  Detan drew his sword from his holster and signified for the others to wait.  He walked up to the pod and was suddenly forced backwards.  Blood poured from his left arm and  <BR>Kain and Zack drew their swords.  Lisa looked reluctant but drew hers and they ran up to the ship.  Five creatures jumped from the ship and landed right in front of the three trainers.  The creatures were new to Kain.  They were slightly like galis but nastier.  Their masks were bright white and their capes were more like robes.  Each one held a scythe like axe.  They appeared to be the same main breed but different sub breeds.  A pink robed monster with a heart on its mask swung its axe at Kain&#39;s body.  Kain instinctively threw his sword in the way and the scythe bounced off spraying sparks over his face.  Zack charged at the nearest monster with a blue splash on its mask. <BR> <BR>&#34;Their jokers, be careful, their normal monsters but their powerful.&#34;  Detan called from on the floor a fair bit away. <BR> <BR>Three of the jokers were clashing swords with the trainers whilst a joker made from rock was fighting Bolt, Fierce and Destiny.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Death energy!&#34;  It cried in a hissing voice. <BR> <BR>Dark light formed around his palm and the energy formed into blades that sprayed over the monsters.  Bolt opened his claws and released a round of energy shots into the enemy.  It keeled over slightly.  Fierce sent a boomerang of wings that cut the joker in half.  It fell to the floor and sunk into a ball.   <BR> <BR>Kain saw it and panicked.  The joker had become a frozen disc, a disc containing all the jokers&#39; information but un operable.  The joker was the closest to dead a monster could ever be.  He forgot about his battle and instantly regretted it.  The tang of pain ripped through his arm.  Blood dripped onto the floor and collected in small ruby pools. Kain bit his lip and plunged the samurai sword into the cape.  The joker bled and slid down the length of the sword before forming in to a ball.  Meanwhile Lisa was viciously slashing on the offensive against a blue joker.  Their swords were dancing and sending waves of sparks in every direction.  Lisa went to stab the creature then quickly slashed it across.  The sword past through effortlessly and the third joker fell to the ground as a ball of light.  Zack was powerfully fighting the final joker.  It had a red slash across its face and a dark red cloak.  Its scythe was longer and sharper than the others had been and Zack was struggling to keep ahead of it.  The joker flew backwards and energy surrounded its fist. <BR> <BR>&#34;Death energy!&#34;  It hissed. <BR>The balls of black formed into blades and rocketed towards Zack.  Zack ducked and jumped around them but two hit him leaving black burn marks.  Zack could hardly move from injury and his companions were to far away to be of any help.  He threw his sword with great force at the unsuspecting joker.  It panicked and twirled its axe.  The end knocked the sword away harmlessly and the joker laughed like a clown.  Its axe was above its head as it advanced upon the injured Zack.  Zack fell to the floor and waited for the inevitable swish.  There was a blast and the joker stopped.  It turned to light and formed a ball just next to him.  The scythe was gone.  Detan was holding a glowing silver gun and he smiled painfully.  Lisa ran to Detan while Kain jogged over to Zack.  Their injuries were quite serious but they had all survived.  Later that day they made it to the healing bay.  Kain lay down in a thin silver cubicle and the lights scanned him.  There was a fuzzy noise in the background and then electric beams ran over his skin.  He could feel himself relaxing as they moved up his body, he thought it may be an anesthetic but he felt more awake than ever.  The pain was also fading, he turned to his arm and the blood was gone.  It was like watching the cut in rewind.  The blood was sucked into the wound and then it zipped up.  He heard a hiss and the cubicle opened.  He climbed out and saw the others reappearing around him.  They all looked fine.   <BR> <BR>&#34;What was that?&#34;  Asked Zack. <BR> <BR>&#34;Recovery machine, it takes a while to warm up but it has the affect of a nut oil, a mint leaf and repairs any injuries.  Perfect for after battles but not a great deal of help during them.&#34;  Detan smiled and looked at his chest. <BR> <BR>&#34;Thank you for earlier, that gun was the only thing that stopped me from getting slashed.&#34; Zack patted Detan&#39;s back. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why did they attack us?&#34; Kain asked. <BR> <BR>&#34;We are near a planet at war, the jokers are blocking off any ships trying to deliver food or supplies to their enemies.  They must have mistaken us for a delivery ship.  Fact is that the Jokers are violent and brutal murderers.  They attacked the planet for no reason and its inhabitants were no threat to them.&#34;  Detan said coldly. <BR> <BR>&#34;There are whole armies of them?  How are the good guys doing?&#34;  Said Lisa.  <BR> <BR>Detan laughed a little.  &#34;There are no good guys in a war, just different sides, however the sides are pretty evenly match at the moment.  Since the jokers attacked unprovoked they are our enemies as well.  Gentlemen, welcome to your first assignment, we are gonna end this war and defeat the jokers.&#34; <BR> <BR>The ship seemed to increase in speed and Kain saw the planet, the planet was mostly ground but had oceans within the land.  The ship made it through to the planet undetected and landed with no interruption.  The ground was dry and dusty and when the ship landed a  cloud of dust shot up.  Kain walked out with Detan, Lisa, Kain, Fierce, Bolt and Destiny.  Detan pointed to a larger door in the ships side.  From the outside the ship looked even bigger, like a cruise ship on earth. <BR> <BR>&#34;If we need any more monsters we open this door.&#34;  Detan explained.   <BR> <BR>There was a noise in the background, a quiet low-pitched mumble.  Detan was looking around with his sword drawn.  His boots were dusty and scuffed already and his grey hair reflected the suns light.  HE ran off towards a sand dune and the others followed.  Despite the barren landscape the climate was not exceptionally warm.  They reached a tall hill and looked down into a valley.  There was a crowd of monsters battling below them.  All of them were of two types, either jokers or another strange breed that Kain had never seen before.  They had weird clam shaped bodies with crested heads.  Their arms, legs and neck were long, thin wires.  Many of the creatures were carrying cutlasses to battle the jokers.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Those are metalners.  They are natural inhabitants of this planet and eternal enemies of the joker.&#34;  Detan explained without looking upwards from the battle.  The battle field was swamped by light from dead monsters of both types.  Kain strained his eyes and focused on a single monster.  It was a pink metalner with hearts encircling its spinning top shaped body.  It had forced its cutlass onto a nearby joker and was forcing downwards, the joker was defending and forcing the cutlass away from his face.  Suddenly the love seeker smacked the joker&#39;s face with its free hand.  The joker slid out quickly from under the sword and fired a fist of black energy at the UFO.  The creature fell backwards and wobbled on its tentacle legs.  Its light bulb eyes flashed slightly then faded and the creature exploded in sparks.  The joker laughed until another metalner this time silver, threw its cutlass at the jokers unprotected head.  Another dead monster turned to light.  Kain turned away.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Are we going to help them then?&#34; Lisa shouted to Detan.  <BR> <BR>Detan seemed to be lost in his thoughts and suddenly snapped awake.  He nodded and jumped down the hill towards the ship.  He beckoned to Zack and he ran over and opened the huge door.  Hundreds of monsters looked at him from within.  Detan pointed at several different monsters and they followed him back to the others.  The sand on the hill was loose and easy to ski down.  The monsters did not seem to realize their entrance to the battle until several monsters were slashed in half by samurai swords.  The metalners seemed to trust Detan instantly and did not check their backs or stay away from him.  A heard of jells went up against some jokers.  The wall mimics formed shields with their hands while others whipped from behind.  The jokers ran up and fired blasts of dark energy from theirf fists.  A pure jell thrust a sharp tentacle through a cloak.  Elsewhere Kain was amazed to see a gang of colour pandoras tackle two jokers by creating a wave of segments.  They all formed into a tower and then fell onto the jokers, yet again it showed initiative on the battle field.  Slowly the number of attacking jokers trickled away to nothing.  When the last one fell to a blast from Detans laser gun the metalners let out a loud cheer.  The metalners began collecting the frozen discs of their comrades.  Detan placed the gun in a holster left of his waist and turned to face a metalner.  <BR> <BR>&#34;We cannot thank you enough, we greatly need your help in these battles.&#34;  The metalner said.  It was a shiny silver but had been covered in dust from the battle field.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Not a problem, it&#39;s my job.&#34;  Detan said happily and picked up four frozen discs.   <BR> <BR>&#34;This way.&#34;  A metalner said, he pointed at a giant dusty hill and Kain sighed. <BR> <BR>The hill was steep and the path leading up it was dusty.  Kain dragged his leather boots up the warm rock and turned to see the others following.  At the top of the hill he dropped the frozen discs and fell to his knees to catch his breath.  A metalner walked up to him and smiled. <BR> <BR>&#34;We are very near the temple now, when we get their you can have a regeneration.  You will feel much better.  Is this your renocraft?&#34;  The silver creature asked. <BR> <BR>Kain nodded and looked at Bolt.  He was managing ok but looked a little tired.  When Kain first saw the building his legs stopped working.  The building was huge.  It had a thin white spire pointing to the evening sky, its surfaces were all white and silver while torches of fire lit up its sides.  Kain walked in amazement.  The inside was just as luxurious with silver walls and metal floors.  Kain and the others were shown to regeneration booths by pink metalners that they presumed to be female.  Kain was recharged and then climbed out.  Around him Detan and Lisa were climbing from their cabins.  The rest of the day was a guided tour around the temple.  The whole building was like a giant monastery, the metalers lived, worked and worshiped here.  Kain saw the drawings and carvings and they were all very accurate.  The group was pushed into a giant church room, it was the biggest room in the temple and consisted of many beautiful windows and carvings.  Kain looked to the center wall, it was a giant shield with strange markings on it.  The shield was white in the background with a giant sword running three quarters if the way vertically in the center of the shield.  At the bottom of the sword two spears created another section leaving three separate chambers.  In one was a dragon, thin and wirey like a legendry dragon, not like the monsters that had been on earth.  Another section yielded a suite of Armour, Kain could not tell what it was but it seemed to be not quite right.  The bottom section held a picture of a man riding a horse.  The metalner guiding them seemed to notice Kains intrest in the artifact.   <BR> <BR>&#34;That is our worship piece, we use it to contact our god and leader.  He is the ultimate battler and it is said that he is the main enemy of all jokers.  In the ultimate battle he shall return to us and save us.  This can only happen when all is lost for us.  We are not quite sure on his appearance or roll in the battle but we do know he was a knight many, many years ago.&#34;  The metalner said with great pride. <BR> <BR>When Kain looked downwards he saw a gathering of different metalners worshipping the shield from below.   There was a crash and a metalner came running in, blood pouring from his head.  Metalner blood was silver and thick like mercury at room temperature.  The metalner ran in and collapsed.  A joker followed him and cut him in half at the body.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Bow down to us!&#34; Its whispery voice echoed through out the chapel. <BR> <BR>&#34;This is a place of worship, do not start a battle here!&#34;  An elderly metalner said angrily. <BR> <BR>The joker ran forwards and swung his axe, the metalner just jumped over.  His foot swung up and caught the joker&#39;s face.  Drops of blood fell from the mask and stained the dark cloak.  The joker&#39;s fist was coated in dark light and a fist of energy fired from it at the preacher.  He shrugged off the blow and jumped forward.  His arms swung at the clown and knocked him back slightly.  There was a blast of light and the joker fell to the floor.   <BR> <BR>&#34;How did he do that?&#34;  Asked Kain in awe. <BR> <BR>&#34;He is the strongest metalner known to us.  He is the head preacher and also the shaman.&#34;  A nearby metalner said. <BR> <BR>Suddenly a procession of metalners came in solemnly.  They were walking in line with their heads bowed and carrying cushions.  On each cushion were five frozen discs.   <BR> <BR>&#34;What are they doing?&#34;  Asked Kain. <BR> <BR>&#34;Shhh, watch the regeneration process.&#34; The metalner guide whispered. <BR> <BR>The cushions were placed on the floor in a ray of light caused by a ceiling window.  The beam of light was reflected in all directions and the metalners began to chant a strange verse.  The light stopped reflecting and it appeared that the balls were absorbing the beams.  Slowly each ball changed shape and floated into the air.  Baby metalners began springing from them and settling on their legs.  Finnaly they stopped chanting and the metalners walked from the chapel.   <BR> <BR>&#34;That is out way of replenishing hope to the dead.  This brings the dead back as children.&#34;  The metalner said then lead them from the room.   <BR> <BR>When they reached their rooms they all gasped.  Even Detan looked impressed.  The beds were white and just like the ones they had on earth but with a thick wooden post at each corner, leading into the ceiling.  The sheets were thin but warm and Kain fell asleep in seconds despite the nut oil he had received in the regeneration booth.   <BR> <BR>The next mourning was slow to start.  Kain got dressed and eat a piece of meat he had in his rucksack he looked at the stirring Bolt and threw the bone towards him.  The metalners were all walking around the chapel in little groups and doing different jobs.  Their long, thin arms were great at reaching high or far away objects.  Kain and Zack went back to the church and saw more metalners preying.  The shield was still their and the metalners seemed to take it as a part of everyday life.  Kain couldn&#39;t help but stare at it even though he had only seen it the past day.  There was something about it that just drew the eyes.  Suddenly a metalner let out a slight cry and pointed upwards to the glass panel on the ceiling.  Kain could hear a noise lowering in tone.  It sounded like a falling aircraft.  There was a crash and a ball of fire fell through the window sending shards of glass down on the metalner like large drops of rain.  The metalners jumped in different directions and the ball of fire settled on the ground.  It was a phoenix, at least it looked a little like one, it was wearing purple armour and had incredibly long flames.  It dropped a scroll on the floor and parted its wings.  A noise came from its beak that seemed much to deep and scratchy to be from it and then it rocketed into the air.  The scroll was slightly torched and the nearest metalner picked it up carefully.  He began to read then looked up alarmed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Its from the jokers!&#34;  He said. <BR> <BR>He carried on reading as the others crowded around him and tried to read over his shoulder.  The note was of medium length and written in thin, swirly writing.  Kain watched them then shouted across the chapel.   <BR> <BR>&#34;What does it say?&#34;   <BR> <BR>The metalners all jumped then relaxed when they realized who it was.  A yellow metalner that appeared to have suezo patterns on it stood up. <BR> <BR>&#34;It says they are to attack in short parties until three days time, then the whole joker colony are planning a giant mass attack.  This is very bad, if all their ships come down then we are in a lot of trouble.  They have a huge army and much more technology than us.  Detan and Lisa had arrived and so had several other metalners.  Detan was watching the windows and seemed anxious, as if he was waiting for an attack but none came.  Eventually the chapel returned to normal.  The UFO creatures were planning a massive defense and no one seemed to have any idea how they would survive.  The first attack came at midnight.  The metalners had set up guard towers and there were guards patrolling the whole temple at all times.  Kain sat wide-awake with the others and waited, they knew that the jokers would not be able to resist an attack that day.  It came.  A horde of jokers crawled over the horizon.  Kain sounded the alarm and a large army of metalners got in formation.  As the jokers reached them they all seemed a bit surprised.  The well-organized aliens were much more powerful than the random jokers.  A blue terror swung his axe at Kain and knocked his sword away.  Kain ducked down and the joker laughed.  It did not see the flash of silver in Kain&#39;s boot.  There was a quick movement and Kain had a gun pointing at the jokers face.  The trigger was pulled three times and a broken mask fell to the floor and turned into a shiny ball.  Lisa was very good at sword fighting, she jumped at a joker and cut his cope in half, as he fell to the floor she span around and cut the joker behind her.  Both of them turned to glowing balls and slowly the jokers turned from a huge crowd to a couple to some light balls on the floor.  The metalners had found it quite easy.  It was great.  Their moral jumped through the roof as they won.  They knew that the real fight would be a lot more difficult but this had been really easy.   <BR> <BR>The days wore on; they were only attacked once more in the time before the battle.  It was strange; the metalners seemed to get more relaxed as the time leading up to the battle passed.  The night before the battle was to start Kain sat up in bed, no one in the room was asleep and Detan was polishing his sword.  Kain watched him, it was amazing how sharp his sword was but he never cut through the rag he was using.  The light from a candle in the center of the room was acting strangely around Detan.  Slowly Lisa and Zack noticed by following Kain&#39;s glare.  The light was reflecting around him as if the sword was cutting it.  He was in a small bubble of blue, shimmering light.  Detan placed the thin blade in a holder and lied down.  Kain thought about him for a little then rolled over and went to sleep.  They were woken early by a metalner.  It looked worried and just pointed out of the room.  Kain and Detan ran out first and stared into the hallway.  It was empty.  Then Kain saw it.  Out of the window he could see a mass of creatures, all jokers.  There were tanks though.  High tech tanks with lasers and missiles.  Small pod shaped craft like the one that had boarded Detan&#39;s ship flew overhead.  Kain grabbed his sword and placed the holder on his back.  Lisa and Zack had already got their swords and Zack was placing a gun in each boot.  The team ran out and Bolt stared at the sky for a few moments.  It was a difficult silence.  The jokers had not begun the attack but were standing in rows and columns.  They all had their scythes in formation.  A joker stepped forward and laughed a high-pitched cackle. <BR> <BR>&#34;We will begin the elimination in three minutes.  Be prepared for the slaughter!&#34; His voice rang out. <BR> <BR>The metalners all came from the temple and stood facing the wall of tanks, craft and jokers.  Then they did what they had been taught to do before a war.  They preyed.  Each one bowed in their own time and closed their cat like eyes.  Kain did not know whether to join them but in the end just stood waiting. Bolt scanned the crowd of enemies with his eyes and looked sadly up at Kain.  Kain could hardly bare to look down at the sad face.  Detan had drawn his sword then a metalner cried out.  There was a cliff beside what was soon to become the battlefield.  The long wirey arm pointed to its peak and an army of heads looked up.  On the mountains top was a shiny surface.  As the sun went behind a cloud the reflection faded and Kain could make out the shield.  The metalners were all whispering loudly.  Detan was the only quiet person on the field.  The jokers were wondering what the fuss was about but the metalners knew no one had moved it.  There was a tiny rumble in the ground.  Then the jokers charged.                                              <BR> <BR> <BR>There was a flash of light as thunder rolled across the sky.  A bright tongue of electricity fired from the clouds and shot towards Detan.  His sword was pointing to the heavens and he stood silent and solemn.   <BR>The lightning was not hurting him and slowly his body began to glow.  The jokers had stopped running, the tanks had stopped moving and fighter jets were hovering above them.  All eyes from both armies were on Detan.  Slowly he was going silver.  Metal ran down his arms and across his chest.  His skin was fading, and leaving the silver.  Balls of yellow were forming at his knees and shoulders.  His head was the only part of him left untouched.  He moved his arms and took off the yellow tinted goggles he had always worn.  His eyes were big red dots, no white or iris, just huge red pupils.  Lightning struck his head and left a helmet of metal on him.  He swung his sword and laughed quietly.  Lighting ran across the sky and he jumped.  He landed with four legs.  Except it was not him.  There was a centaur below him.  It had long, scruffy hair and thick dark green skin.  It was holding a long, sharp lance. <BR> <BR>&#34;It is our lord, he is here.  Prey down to Lancelot.&#34;  An elderly metalner shouted. <BR> <BR>The jokers seemed to awaken and returned to charging.  At the battle cries of the jokers, the metalners also awoke.  Before the enemies could meet the centaur that Detan was riding whinnied.  It charged forward and threw its spear towards the horde of joker.  The spear moved silently but gathered light on its journey.  When it hit the ground a blast of light exploded from it.  A shell of brightness engulfed all the jokers within ten meters and within the light Kain could see the silhouettes crumbling to the floor.  The jokers all panicked and ran in different directions, they totally scrambled.  Then the centaur raised its front legs and Detan held up his sword.  A ball appeared at its top.  The ball was growing and had blue electricity running around it.  Detan swung his sword and the ball flew into the air.  The ball exploded and hundreds of long blue beams came from it.  They settled in the sky.  Slowly they took the shapes of dragons , dragons with dog faces and long curved horns.  Kain watched in amazement as the wolf like dragons swooped down and slashed at the jokers.  Slowly the dragons picked off the flying joker ships.  The ships were fats but could not compete against the speeding dragons.  Kain looked down to the battlefield for a moment and saw Detan riding on the centaurs back cutting down the very last jokers.  The metalners were to shocked to celebrate their victory.  Detan slowly trotted back to them and leapt off the centaur.  Suddenly the armour, the centaur and the dragons all disappeared and Detan stood facing the metalners.  <BR> <BR>Two days later they were back on the ship.  The metalners had begged him to stay.  He had not said very much to any of them since his transformation.  So he sat them down at lunch.   <BR> <BR>&#34;You guys are probably wondering how I did that huh?&#34;  He said laughing slightly.    <BR>          <BR>Zack nodded lightly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well I am Lancelot the god of the metalner.&#34;  He said as if it was common knowledge. <BR> <BR>&#34;But how, the religion has been around for centuries and you are…&#34; Lisa slowed as she spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;Backwards.&#34;  Detan said nodding. <BR> <BR>&#34;Of course.&#34; Lisa said <BR> <BR>&#34;What?&#34;  Zack said. <BR> <BR>&#34;What&#39;s my name backwards?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Nated?&#34;  Kain said. <BR> <BR>&#34;Of course, that’s not his whole name is it? Reincarnated.&#34;  Zack grasped it. <BR> <BR>&#34;I have been this way for millennia, before the universe was even here.  I am a primal.  There are others of us out there, each breed has a primal and it is us who started monsters in the first place.&#34; <BR> <BR>The ship carried on and Detan continued his story, the universe is back in swing.  Space is big, and needs lots of looking after.  Detan was going to do his part very soon.  He was going to leave. <BR> <BR>I like this story, as always give muchos muchos &#40;a lot of&#41; feedback and I&#39;d just like to say how good all the stories on this site are. BTW i like the name of this one.
