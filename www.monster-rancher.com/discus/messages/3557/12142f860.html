 Gali turned his head and began to walk away from the carnage. He scolded his fellow monsters for not backing him up and making him do all the dirty work. Gali floated over towards the Pulscorn, salvia poured out of his mouth as he lay with shattered ribs. Gali knew he’d be a hassle to their efforts. The Godly figure placed 2 translucent fingers on the Pulscorn’s head and a soft streak of lightning vibrated through his body. Pulscorn’s breathing became less and less and his heartbeat stopped. A quick painless death was what Gali wanted to give him.  <BR> <BR>The news came to Darthgali as he sat in a throne pondering how his brother fared. A Ripper dashed into the room and alerted him that the Madillos were killed. Darthgali sighed at his minion’s failure. He motioned his hand and a said to “Release him.”  <BR> <BR>“Him?” The Ripper asked cowering.  <BR>“Yes, I do believe my brother will get a kick out of it.”  <BR>“What if he fails?”  <BR>“Then I’ll have to kill him myself.”  <BR>“Yes sir.” The Ripper said a he jolted out of the room.  <BR> <BR>Gali buried the body and the other monsters paid their last respects to him and the Golem. They turned and walked on. Gali continued to find more cities destroyed, but something was different about the destruction of these villages. It seemed a lot more fire was used; it doesn’t seem like a small monsters fire attack. It didn’t look good and Gali knew it was something big. He didn’t know what it could be; he had little knowledge of most of his brother’s henchmen after the Madillos.  Ashes were all that inhabited the remains of the villages. Darthgali was becoming more tiresome with trying to track Gali down, and he knew it.  <BR> <BR>A shadow cast upon the ground, it was large and moved too be fast to be a cloud. Gali looked up and saw a Death Dragon. The skin of the creature had been rotting off and his bones showed easily through the remains. Gali put it all together; it was him who was killing. He signaled for his comrades to hide as he did. Gali and his group followed the Dragon. They tried to get to him, but he was too fast to catch. He approached a city and with a single burst of fire a city of 100, 000 became a city of 0. Gali could feel the heat from the blast even though he was nearly 2 miles away. He cringed at the thought of being a human in that, but without any signs of stopping the Dragon continued to speed on. He would surely kill more people if he wasn’t stop. Gali shot a bolt of lightning at the Dragon while he was still visible to the naked eye.  <BR> <BR>The lightning wave hit the dragon and surged through him, it didn’t do any damage, but it did catch the dragon’s attention and enraged him. He shot more hellish flames as Gali tried to hold a force field of his own energy up to stop the blast from hurting him and his group. The flames heat could be felt with full force and Gali even remarked that it was several times hotter than the Sun. The force field was getting weaker and draining as seeps of fire could escape through the weak parts of the field and burn the group. Gali knew he could hold it for almost 1 more minute. The dragon had no signs of quitting and he too knew that the force field was giving up. Gali yelled at his group asking if anyone could make a field like his own. A Pixie volunteered, she was a Mint. She used all her might to hold the field up as Gali got ready to attack. He said once he’s ready to let the field go and leave the rest to him. The Mint exclaimed that she only could hold it for 30 more seconds. She wasn’t as strong as Gali and could hardly handle the pressure. Still the flames continued to pour out of the dragon’s mouth in hopes that he will get through and kill Gali and please his Master.  <BR> <BR>The Mint screamed as she passed out and the fields went down. Gali was able to launch and attack of his own. An angelic figure shot through the flames. Like the one he used when they fought the Madillos. It ripped through the flames and smashed the Death Dragon in the head, snapping it back. The dragon slowly fluttered to the ground. He looked at a monster in his group and asked who wanted to make to Ultimate Sacrifice for the world. A brave Ape raised his hand. Gali exhaustedly told him to just stall him long enough for his energy to return. Then Gali would help him.  <BR> <BR>The Ape crawled after the dragon as he landed. He snapped his head downwards and looked at the Ape.  <BR> <BR>“I haven’t had a good meal in awhile.” The dragon grinned.  <BR> <BR>The Ape stood silent as he charged at the dragon. He went to thwack him, but was too slow and the dragon dodged to the right and bent over and grabbed a hold of the Ape with his teeth her dug deeper into the Ape’s skin and threw him into a tree. The Ape’s shoulder bleed rapidly, Gali knew that it would be soon that the Ape gives out and is killed. The Ape sat at the bottom of the tree and stared at certain death. He tensed his body and rolled over at the dragon. The dragon hopped aside, but that fell under the Ape’s plan as he reached around and grabbed the dragon and twirled him around as he threw him through trees.  <BR> <BR>A furious scream came deep from within the tree where he was thrown. Suddenly a stream of fire shot out of the flame and engulfed the Ape. Killing him instantly. Gali hovered off to fight the beast. Ape failed in giving him enough time to fight back strongly, but he had enough time to recover and he could still fight. The Dragon flew rapidly at Gali as a translucent arm exploded out of his chest and collided with the dragons head. It stopped him dead in his tracks. Gali cringed, the dragon’s Intelligence was that good, but he was well versed in everything else.  <BR> <BR>The Dragon climbed to his feet, but was burnt by a Napalm by Gali. He knew that he would be too angry to control, so he couldn’t let him get back to his. Feet, Gali’s crew fear to fight the dragon after seeing what happened to Ape. The dragon exploded up and blocked the bolt of lightning and as fast as the lightning bolt itself he whipped his wing out. It caused a strong gust of wind that ran right through Gali. His defense had been lowered badly trying to hold off the flames from the start that he passed out and was easy pickings for the dragon. A Naga wouldn’t let Gali be killed and Screw Dove right into the Dragon’s head. It caused him to fall back as a flame shot into his stomach. It was from the Mint, she was exhausted as she fell on her knees and passed out once more. The dragon trying to recover from the shock was smacked in the stomach by a Pancho who took safety in his shell. He revved himself up again and continued smacking into the Dragons gut. The whipped his tail around and literally sent the Pancho into orbit after his next try. A slash from behind came from a Naga. When he turned around claws from a Mew dug into his rotting flesh, the Death Dragon stared at the Mew clawing at his chest and opened his mouth and got hold of the Mew and ate her. Muffled screams could be heard during the process. A Raiden attacked the dragon hard as he was still being clawed at. The Raiden was one of the strongest in their group and was dealing out a lot of damage to the Dragon. Then with a fury the dragon exploded to the sky and let out a stream of fire that closed down on the group. <BR> <BR>Sorry for the wait.

 &#34;He knew that he would be too angry to control, so he couldn’t let him get back to his. Feet, Gali’s crew fear to fight the dragon after seeing what happened to Ape.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Some serious proofreading issues. Even though you are improving, I feel this one was a step down from the last chapter. <BR> <BR>Not the greatest, not the worst. I&#39;ll make a call on this story if your next chapter is presented better. Enough to ressurect my interest anyway.

 &#34;The dragon slowly fluttered to the ground. He looked at a monster in his group and asked who wanted to make to Ultimate Sacrifice for the world. A brave Ape raised his hand. &#34; <BR> <BR>In this passage, it seems to the casual passerby that the Dragon, after fluttering to the ground, called upon an ape to make a sacrifice.
