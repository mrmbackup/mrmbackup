 I remembered I had this story I wrote after posting the character Elyk.  It&#39;s really not that good because I prefer creating characters of my own design and letting the person imagin them, it&#39;s harder when describing something that already exists... anyways, on with it... <BR>Oh and sorry about the no indentions. <BR> <BR>Pushing the Limit <BR>        Part 1 &#40;3 or 4 parts&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>        Elyk&#39;s naga, a purple creature with a human shaped torso, a snake like lower half where its legs would be, and a head that was shaped similar to mans only without hair and its ears were fins, down its spine ran a flap of skin held together by little purple spikes sticking out of its back and was completely scaled, fell to the ground.  &#34;You&#39;ll be alright, come on Slash.&#34; Elyk helped Slash up and put him onto his back.  He carried him toward town, which was about a half a mile away. <BR>	Eventually Elyk made it to the lab.  &#34;Is he going to be okay?&#34;  Elyk asked, the monster was bordering 3 years and was much to young to die, every human year was about 15 monster years.   <BR>	&#34;I think he&#39;s dying.&#34;  Corte said as he examined Slash. &#34;He&#39;s going to die of old age, how old is he?&#34; <BR>	&#34;He&#39;s only 2 years 10 months.&#34;  Elyk looked at Corte like he was confused. <BR>	&#34;Well, naga are one of the shortest living monsters, even if this is extremely early.  Well you&#39;ll have to get a new monster.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Freeze Slash, I&#39;ll come back tomorrow and decide what I&#39;m going to do.&#34;  Elyk looked at Corte and gave a nod. <BR>	&#34;Okay.&#34;  Corte took Slash through a door into the back of his lab.  Trainers were not normally aloud to go back there, so many wondered what went on back there. <BR>	Elyk began his walk back home.  He was thinking about a decision that he was going to make very soon.  He needed to decide whether or not he was going to combine his first monster, a zuum, which was a small dinosaur like monster that looked similar to an T-rex, only it was about the size of a Velociraptor, named Scale, with Slash.  He decided, yes, he would, and he would use his dragon fang and his cd fragment.  Monsters were strange, you could combine two together to get a monster that was part of both parents.  Parents wasn&#39;t really the word though, the two monsters were mated together, they were combined to come out with a totally new monster that was similar in strengths and weaknesses compared to the two monsters combined to get it.  Then items were used to manipulate the combining process to make the monster that came out a certain type or to make it stronger. <BR>	Elyk decided, he would do it.  He would use the dragon fang, which would give him a dragon, a monster that was similar to its mythical counterpart only it was about the size of a car, it was red, and it stood upright, not on four legs.  Then he would use his cd fragment to screw with the program and would hopefully cause the correct mutation and make the monster come out stronger than it actually should be.  Of course it was illegal to use two items while combining because it could screw with the program to much and the monster could come out with mutated defects instead of mutated advantages.  It was worth the risk though and Elyk was sure that Corte would do it for him. <BR>	November 24th 1059 <BR>	   Elyk woke up early at 7:00 so he was sure he would be at the lab when it opened at 8:00.  He began walking toward town around 7:45.  He walked and convinced himself that he was making the right decision.  He came walking up to the lab and hesitated before he went inside.  Taking a deep breath he went inside. <BR>	&#34;Hey Elyk what was your decision?&#34;  Corte asked happily. <BR>	&#34;I&#39;m going to combine Slash and Scale using this,&#34;  Elyk pulled the dragon fang from his backpack,  &#34;and this.&#34;  He the pulled out a cd fragment with the other hand. <BR>	Corte closed the lab up. &#34;Are you sure you want to do this, it could have defects.&#34;  <BR>	&#34;Yes.&#34;  Elyk handed the items to Corte. <BR>	&#34;Well seeing this is an illegal operation, I&#39;ll have to charge you an extra 200 bucks, okay?&#34;  Corte looked over at Elyk. <BR>	&#34;Yeah.&#34;  Elyk had brought more than the usual 500 dollars just in case, but he wasn&#39;t going to tell Corte he had a 1000 bucks. <BR>	Corte walked into the back.  Elyk heard some slurping sounds and then a slight humming.  A glow came from beneath the door and then Corte walked out. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, there was a mutation.  I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s going to live.&#34; <BR>	&#34;No.&#34;  Elyk kind of trailed off and then looked at the ground trying to hold back the tears.	 <BR>	&#34;Just kidding.&#34;  Corte laughed a little and then a little dragon about waist high walked out.  &#34;The only noticeable differences between it and a normal dragon is its wings are gold tipped and so are its horns.  Oh yeah, it seems that both of its canine teeth are pure red.&#34;  The little dragon hand a little bit of smoke rising from its snout. <BR>	&#34;Thanks Corte.&#34; Elyk bent down and touched the dragon on its snout. &#34;I&#39;ll call you.....&#34; He stopped and thought for a second, Gold Wing, Gold Horn, Red Fang, &#34;Red Fang.&#34; <BR>	The little dragon growled in happiness and then turned toward Corte.  Blew some smoke at him and then flew up into Elyk&#39;s arms.  <BR> <BR>May 30th 1060 <BR>	&#34;Good job Red Fang.&#34;  Elyk patten Red Fang on the back of his neck.  Red Fang was about man-sized now and was still growing.  Corte had been tests on Red Fang since he was born and hand found out quite a few special things about him. #1: Red Fang was born strong considering the monsters that were used when combining. #2: Red Fang was growing about half as fast as a normal dragon, but that also meant that it would live about twice as long. #3: Red Fang&#39;s Strength grew at tremendous rates, he learned quicker than any normal dragon, his muscle mass grew at about twice the rate of a normal dragons, and his scales hardened a significantly greater amount faster than a normal dragons.  Of course there was a downside, he was about as fast as a pile of rocks.  He had just beat D class at 6 months though, so the speed didn&#39;t really have that much of an effect. <BR>	They got home and Elyk looked over at Red Fang, &#34;How much rest do you need, I know you&#39;ve been training hard and then we went straight into that tournament without even a days rest.&#34; <BR>	Red Fang held up two fingers. <BR>	&#34;Two weeks rest, well, I guess you deserve it.&#34;  Elyk sounded kind of disappointed. <BR>	Red Fang grunted and tapped Elyk on the shoulder.  He then bent down and in the ground spelled out days.  The s was backwards, but he was six months old after all.   <BR>	&#34;Are you sure?&#34;  Elyk frowned in disbelievement. <BR>	He shook his head yes.  Then went into his stable, closed the doors, and fell asleep.  Elyk looked at it from outside, most monsters usually required at least a weeks rest after that much training. <BR> <BR>January 28th 1062 <BR>	Elyk used the stick as a lever to get he bus size rock rolling down the hill.  Red Fang looked at the boulder flying down at him, this was supposed to be a speed drill, but his speed was still really low and he didn&#39;t even know if he could dodge it, so, he didn&#39;t.  The rock smashed into Red Fang right after reaching its top speed.  Red Fang caught it and didn&#39;t move a single inch from the boulder slamming into him.  He then began rolling the boulder back up the hill.   <BR>	&#34;Good job Red Fang!!&#34;  Elyk yelled happily as he looked into his vision goggles, which measured the strength of a monster. &#34;You went up 20 in power and 10 in defense just from that!!!&#34; Then under his breath he added, &#34;Even though this was supposed to be a speed drill.&#34; Then he looked up at Red Fang. &#34;Well, let&#39;s go to town and I&#39;ll get you some meat to eat.&#34;  Red Fang cheered and picked up the rock over his head and threw it up and down over his head catching it and then doing again. &#34;Show off, let&#39;s go to town.&#34; <BR>	About half a hour later they came walking into town.  Everybody was inside and the town was virtually vacant.  &#34;We&#39;re going to go to Corte&#39;s lab first, okay?&#34;  Elyk looked over at Red Fang who shook his head yes.  They walked down the streets of the vacant town and came to Corte&#39;s lab.  The door was locked so Elyk knocked.  No one came to the door.  &#34;Corte, it&#39;s Elyk, answer the door.&#34;  Corte peeked through his curtains and then unlocked the door. <BR>	&#34;Hurry in boy!&#34;  Corte whispered at Elyk who began walking a little faster and Red Fang then came walking in slowly.   <BR>	&#34;What&#39;s going on Corte?.&#34;  Elyk asked as they walked in. <BR>	&#34;About noon six monsters came into town and said that this town was now their town.  If anyone had anything to say about it they are to go south of the town to the base of Mount Creation.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Who&#39;s going?  I know I am.&#34;  Elyk cracked a smile. <BR>	&#34;I think I heard a few trainers talking and saying they would go.  I wouldn&#39;t go if I were you.&#34;  Corte looked Elyk straight in the eyes. <BR>	&#34;What time do I have to be there?&#34; <BR>	&#34;I said I don&#39;t think you....&#34; Corte was cut off. <BR>	&#34;What time?&#34; <BR>	&#34;You have to meet at 5:00, PM.  Please don&#39;t go.&#34; <BR>	&#34;I&#39;m going, right now, it&#39;s 4:30 and it&#39;s at least a hour walk.  Red Fang your going to have to fly us there, okay?&#34;  Elyk looked over at Red Fang who blew a little smoke out of his snout in a nod.  &#34;Bye Corte.&#34; <BR>	A short time later they landed. &#34;4:55, we made it just in time.&#34;  Elyk and Red Fang landed next to 3 other trainers and their monsters.  &#34;Sivart, how&#39;s it goin&#39;.&#34; <BR>	Sivart, a man about 5&#39;11&#34; with brown hair turned and looked at Elyk. &#34;Elyk how ya doin.  I see you got Red Fang with you.  I&#39;ll tell you what, you barely beat my Nova last time and the next him and Red Fang fight, my Nova will win.&#34;  Sivart looked over at his monster which was a hare sub-type tiger, hares were brown monsters that were like rabbits except they were about five feet tall not including ears and stood upright like a man.  The fact that Nova was sub-type Tiger, which were monsters that looked amazingly like blue wolves, mad it blue and white.  &#34;My Nova will outspeed your monster next time.&#34;  Sivart smiled. <BR>	&#34;Isn&#39;t that....&#34; Elyk trailed off. <BR>	&#34;Yeah, kind of a quiet guy.&#34;  Elyk and Sivart looked over at Atries, the 5th highest rank trainer in the world.  Next to him stood a henger, a robot monster that was about 7 ½ feet tall and light brown.  It was shaped like a skeleton of a man only it was solid with no holes, solid metal, and its head was shaped like a bowl with the front taken out and attached to the back.  This particular monster&#39;s name was Excalibur, it had shocked the world by even beating S-class, the highest ranking class right above A.  Then it beat monsters rated in the top 10 of the world until it faced #4, a durahan which was a monster that looked like knight armor that was filled with nothing, and lost.  What was incredible that its strength rating was only 3024, while the previous rank #5 monster&#39;s stats had been about 3425, a significant difference.  Excalibur and Atries had only made it because Atries and Excalibur worked as a team, Atries watching and telling Excalibur what to do and when, and Excalibur always doing what he was supposed to, to the exact detail. <BR>	The third trainer there was some kid with a suezo, a monster that was one big eye covered by a skin flap over most of it except the front, and then a big mouth right underneath.  That&#39;s all it was besides a little tail coming down from it that it hopped around on.   <BR>	&#34;What are we up against here?&#34;  Elyk asked Sivart. <BR>	&#34;I don&#39;t know, I know there&#39;s six of them.&#34;  Sivart looked up at the mountain as a group of monsters came along. <BR>	&#34;I&#39;ll get out my vision goggles.&#34;  Elyk reached into his backpack and grabbed his vision goggles.  &#34;Let&#39;s see here.&#34;  He looked at Red Fang who had a strength level of 2431, then at Nova who had one of 2400 flat, Excalibur who now was at 3098, and finally the suezo which was at a whopping 1257.  Six monsters came down the mountain.  Elyk looked at them, they were wild monsters so obviously they couldn&#39;t be that strong.  Elyk was wrong.  The one who looked like the leader, a henger sub-type joker &#40;looked like a normal henger only was purple and had blades sticking out of its elbows and knees going off to the side&#41;, was at 2742, then a pixie came &#40;pixies are little monsters about 5&#39; tall that looked like a woman with a pink fur shirt that covered only to right above the belly button and had no sleeves, then tight pink shorts that went down about to mid-thigh, it had a little pink wings and pink hair&#41; that was about 2414, then a golem &#40;a monster about eight feet tall that was shaped like an extremely bulked up man with long arms and was completely made of grey boulders stuck together&#41; at 2397, then a joker &#40;think grim reaper only  the garment is purple with gold trim and the sickle has a large axe blade on the back of it and most importantly a mask floated where the hood would be that was a ceramic looking clown face&#41; at 2302, next a wracky &#40;a little toy boy doll monster dressed in a suit with a little razor blade&#41; at 2100, and last a mock &#40;a monster about nine feet tall that looked like a brown tree with multiple branches as arms and roots as feet&#41; at 2068.  &#34;This is not good.&#34;  Elyk looked over at Sivart. <BR>	&#34;How strong are they?&#34;  Sivart asked Elyk.  <BR>	&#34;They are all about 2000 to 2800.&#34;  Elyk looked at them in horror. <BR>	&#34;Our monsters are stronger than some of them and Excalibur is stronger than all of them.  We can do it.&#34;  Sivart tried sounding helpful.   <BR>	&#34;There is six of them and four of us, that suezo over there only has a strength of like, 1200 or something like that.  We can&#39;t win.&#34;  Elyk frowned and looked up at Red Fang.  &#34;Actually, maybe we can.&#34;  <BR>	The monsters reached the bottom of the mountain. &#34;Are you our challengers, don&#39;t make me laugh.&#34;  The henger sub-type joker spoke.  Everyone but Atries looked surprised. &#34;My name is Death, remember it well.  This is Selina,&#34; He gestured toward the pixie, &#34;this is Crusher,&#34; he gestured toward the golem, &#34;this is Reaper,&#34; the Joker floated forward, &#34;this is Chuck,&#34; the little wracky at about 2 feet tall began doing back flips, &#34;and this is Branch.&#34;  The mock raised its branches toward them. <BR>	&#34;Are you ready Red Fang?&#34;  Elyk whispered in his Red Fang&#39;s ear.  Red Fang nodded. &#34;Then go!&#34;  Red Fang had smoke pouring out of his nostrils, then he opened his mouth and fire came bursting from his mouth at the six monsters all of them moved out of the way except Crusher and Branch, Crusher was singed on the leg a little and Branch was incinerated into a pile of ashes on the ground. <BR>	&#34;Nova, go for it now!!&#34;  Nova ran forward and began pummeling Reaper as hard as he could with his fists over and over he hit, Reaper fell back and Nova came up for one crushing blow and was kicked by Death and sent flying.   <BR>	&#34;Excalibur use your lasers.&#34;  Atries was completely calm.  Excalibur had two laser swords come out of his wrists right above his hands and then right above a spinning laser cutter came up, his hands then turned into little cannons.  &#34;Now.&#34;  Excalibur began blasting large beams out of the hand cannons. Selina shot a flame at Excalibur who met it with a blast of his own and almost completely canceled it out but was still hit.  He then swung his laser sword at her and caught her on her arm, cutting her.  Smasher came from behind Excalibur and crushed him into the ground with a large axe handle smash.  Excalibur was down and not getting up, but then he struggled to his feet.  &#34;That&#39;s it Excalibur grit your teeth... or whatever.&#34;  Excalibur then began glowing, turned and hit the golem with both laser swords and laser cutters then blasted him with his cannons.  The golem fell to pieces.  Selina then gave a hard kick into Excalibur, who didn&#39;t even flinch turned and then gave a heavy chop downward on Selina, Selina dodged barely getting out of the way.  Chuck then threw his little razor at Excalibur, it glowed and then hit Excalibur, knocking him down.  Nova gave a hard straight right into Chuck and sent him flying.  Nova then turned and was hit by a fireball by the pixie.  Nova stumbled back and collapsed.  Red Fang was high in the air.  He came down extremely hard and fast toward Death, he hit right on and Death crumpled like tinfoil, his legs being almost completely destroyed.  Chuck, Selina and Reaper lined up in front of Red Fang.  Selina began charging up a ball of energy in front of her, Chuck jumped into the air and Reaper chuckled, the all shot a blast of energy toward Red Fang, Red Fang stood there unable to move fast enough to get out the way, the suezo then teleported there and the teleported him and Red Fang out of the way.  The suezo then spit at Selina and hit her in the eye.  The three monsters turned their attention to the suezo.   <BR>	&#34;Red Fang, let&#39;s get out of here!! Grab the others.&#34;  Elyk pointed toward Nova and Excalibur.  Red Fang flew toward them and picked them up in his hands.  He then landed by Elyk who gestured to everybody, let&#39;s go, they all jumped on and Red Fang grabbed the suezo trainer with a back foot.  The suezo was hit by the Reaper&#39;s energy, Red Fang grabbed the Suezo&#39;s tail in his mouth and flew toward the top of the mountain.  The pixie shot one last fire ball toward them, but missed and they were out of there. <BR>	&#34;We lost.&#34;  Atries said as soon as they landed.  He then took off his backpack and pulled out a few tools, went over to Excalibur and began repairing him.  &#34;Here you guys may need this stuff.&#34;  He reopened his backpack and pulled out some bandages and a few medicines.   <BR>	&#34;We got stomped.&#34;  Sivart looked over at Elyk. <BR>	&#34;Luckily, Red Fang was there to fly us out.&#34;  Elyk smiled. <BR>	&#34;Don&#39;t forget, my suezo, his name One-Eye, bailed out your Red Fang.  By the way my name is Yeoj.&#34;  He smiled an even bigger smile than Elyk.  They grabbed a few bandages some medicine and began fixing up their monsters.      <BR>	&#34;There we go all better.&#34;  Sivart stood Nova up and gave him a big hug.  &#34;You did a good job.&#34;  He pulled a small piece of taffy out of his back pack and gave it to Nova. <BR>	&#34;You okay?&#34;  Elyk asked Red Fang. Red Fang hand small flames coming out of his nostrils.  &#34;Pretty mad, huh?&#34;  Red Fang sniffed the flames back inside.  &#34;We&#39;ll get them next time okay?&#34;  Red Fang showed all his shiny sharp teeth in a big smile. <BR>	&#34;You lost.&#34;  Atries looked at Excalibur.  &#34;Why did you lose.  I was so worried that you could have been injured.  I mean, you were knocked out cold.  Don&#39;t do that anymore, okay?&#34;  Excalibur made a few beeping noises and then dropped his head down into a hanging position looking at the ground.   <BR>	&#34;Good job!!!  I can&#39;t say I could have been more proud.  You saved that big ole dragon over there.  Today One-Eye you really made me happy.  Here have this.&#34;  Yeoj pulled a mango out of his backpack and put it in his suezo&#39;s mouth. <BR>	&#34;We have to get back to town.&#34;  Atries announced.  &#34;That&#39;s where they will be going now that they have defeated the towns defenders. <BR>	&#34;Let&#39;s go.  Red Fang will you give us all rides?&#34;  Elyk asked Red Fang.  Red Fang ushered toward his back.  Elyk got up on the head.  Sivart and Atries got on his back, Yeoj sat on his tail, then Red Fang took off into the air and grabbed Excalibur with one hand, Nova with one hand, and stuck One-Eye between his feet.  He then flew toward the town. <BR>	They landed at the head of the town and everything was completely still and quiet.  &#34;I don&#39;t like this.&#34;  Sivart looked around.  They began walking down the middle of the street toward the center of the town.  They looked around at everything, no wind, no birds chirping, no sound at all.  Nothing in the streets.  No leaves underneath the trees, no leaves on the trees, the town was vacant of life.  They came walking up to the center of the town. <BR>	&#34;Oh, my, god.&#34;  Elyk looked into the middle of the town, where a fountain of water was still going, it was slightly red.  All over the middle of the town were people&#39;s bodies, they littered the ground, just laid out in no orderly fashion.  Flies buzzed around, landing on the bodies of all the people. <BR>	&#34;Uhhh, eh, this is disgusting.  Mom! Dad!&#34;  Sivart ran over to two bodies on the ground laid next to each other.   &#34;I&#39;ll kill those little bastards.&#34;  Sivart stood up with tears in eyes.  &#34;Let&#39;s go!!&#34;  He walked away from the bodies and stood there, back turned. <BR>	Yeoj looked around, &#34;Glad my parents live in Trente.&#34; <BR>	Elyk walked over to Corte who laid there dead.  &#34;Corte, the only person I ever talked to.  You were the last person who was my friend, now I have no friends and no family.  I&#39;ll get them for this.  I promise.&#34;  Elyk bent down and took the key necklace off of Corte&#39;s neck.  &#34;We&#39;ll get some monsters from the lab, then launch an attack against those monsters.  Okay everybody?&#34; <BR>	Atries was bending down at a dead body.  Under his breath he said these words, &#34;Mother, I&#39;m sorry I never visited or called just to say that I loved you, I&#39;m sorry.  I&#39;m sorry.&#34;  He stood up completely holding back his tears, the first time he had to since his childhood.  &#34;Okay everyone let&#39;s go.&#34; <BR>	They came to the street that the lab was on.  Standing at the other end of it was Selina and a group of baby monsters.  She looked down the street at them.  &#34;I see your here.  Your lucky that the rest of us aren&#39;t here.  We would have to kill you.   To bad, oh well, Suezo teleport us.&#34;  She looked over at a couple of baby suezo.  They began concentrating and then they were gone along with Selina and the rest of the baby monsters.   <BR>	&#34;Great.&#34;  Elyk went into the lab and went behind the counter where all the cd&#39;s containing genetic information on different monsters so that they could be replicated using the lab&#39;s machine.  &#34;They took all the cd&#39;s.  Well I wonder how many they made, it couldn&#39;t have been many because they can only feed and hide so many at a time.&#34; <BR>	&#34;So there is no reason for us being here.&#34;  Atries stated with confidence.  &#34;We should go to Trente so that we can warn the rest of the world about these monsters.  It seems they are building a small army of monsters so that they can take over another town or city and maybe then the rest of the world.  These monsters are obviously crazy look what they did to all the town&#39;s people.&#34;  Atries looked over at Red Fang.  &#34;Will you give us a ride?&#34; <BR>	Red Fang blew some smoke out of his nostrils and then grunted a little.  He then knelt down so that they could board.  &#34;Thanks Red Fang.&#34;  Elyk stuck one leg over Red Fang&#39;s neck and then sat down.   <BR>	They came upon Trente about an hours and a half later.  Trente was pretty far away.  &#34;We&#39;re finally here.&#34;  Elyk sounded exhausted.  Red Fang kind of chuckled a little grunt. <BR>	They landed in front of the gates of the mayor&#39;s mansion.  At the gate Atries spoke to the guards.  At first they were hesitant to let them in until Atries pulled out his badge that said that he was ranked 5th in world.  They then let him in without saying another word. <BR>	Went they went into the mayor&#39;s office the mayor stood and said in a friendly voice, &#34;Ah, Atries, 5th highest rank trainer in the world, that&#39;s quite a title.  These people are your friends?&#34; <BR>	&#34;Associates.&#34;  Atries replied and then continued on into another sentence. &#34;This is Elyk, this is Sivart, and this is Yeoj.  They were with me during this entire ordeal.&#34;  Atries looked the mayor straight in the face. <BR>	&#34;What ordeal?&#34;  The mayor asked, now his tone changed to a serious kind of mean sounding tone. <BR>	&#34;The town of Exor was attacked by a band of six monsters, five are left, they defeated the four of us in battle.  These monsters were extraordinarily strong for wild monsters.  One of them could talk, his name was Death, he was an Endbringer, a henger sub-type joker.  He was in command, there was another that could also talk, her name was Selina, she was a pixie, I believe she was second in command.  They broke into the lab at Exor and took the CDS containing genetic information.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Was anybody in Exor hurt?&#34;  The mayor now sounded dead serious. <BR>	&#34;They were all dead when we got back from our lost battle against the monsters.  The monsters had got there before us and killed everybody.  You need to alert all other town officials and spread the news to the world of these five remaining monsters, and their army.&#34; <BR>	&#34;I see.&#34; The mayor pushed a button on his desk.  A man in his early twenties came in.  He was well groomed and with him was a phoenix &#40;looked just like the mythical phoenix&#41;.  &#34;James, could you please have your phoenix deliver this message to all towns within a hundred miles.&#34;  The mayor handed James a note. <BR>	&#34;Yes sir.&#34;  James then left with his phoenix. <BR>	&#34;They will be notified.&#34;  The mayor spoke.  &#34;You will be notified if the monsters attack.  I suggest that you all continue training and battling normally, you must prepare for in case they attack.&#34; <BR>	January 21st 1063 <BR>	&#34;Okay Red Fang use your Fire Breath attack!!&#34;  Elyk yelled. <BR>	&#34;Watch out Nova!&#34;  Sivart yelled in response. <BR>	Red Fang let a blast of fire from his mouth toward Nova who nimbly jumped out of the way and then dodged left and right as he go closer and closer to Red Fang.  Nova jumped in the air just a few feet away from Red Fang and came down as to hit him, but Red Fang turned around and hit Nova with his tail, sending Nova flying and hitting the ground about 20 feet away.  Nova got his feet, stumbled and then stood there.   <BR>	&#34;Okay training over!&#34;  Atries yelled.  Everyone had moved in with Elyk since the monsters had attacked.  They all now trained together and although Nova and Red Fang probably had a while until they died Excalibur was 4 ½ years old now and probably wouldn&#39;t last longer than another year at most.  <BR>	&#34;Everybody ready?&#34;  Elyk asked.  Everyone shook their head yes. &#34;Okay then, let&#39;s go!&#34; <BR>They all began walking toward the battle arena so they could all beat their class, or some of the monsters in it.   <BR>	&#34;Wait up!&#34;  Yeoj came running up.  &#34;I&#39;m going to beat A class!&#34; <BR>	&#34;You know it&#39;s amazing how much stronger One-Eye has gotten since the it began training with us.  It&#39;s strength level now is.....&#34;  Elyk looked in his vision goggles, &#34;2616.  It&#39;s more than doubled in the last year.  That is one strong suezo.&#34; <BR>	&#34;My secret is, that I feed it tablets to keep it from getting stressed out and I always feed it plenty of Vitamin C and D.&#34;  Yeoj smiled as he revealed his secret. <BR>	&#34;I think Vitamin C and D will decrease a monster&#39;s life span.  They may make him train better, but in the long run he&#39;ll die off at least a couple of months earlier.&#34;  Atries looked over at Yeoj. <BR>	&#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true, I mean vitamins don&#39;t hurt us any.&#34;  Yeoj pointed out. <BR>	&#34;Yeah, whatever.&#34;  Atries said in his monotone voice. <BR>	A couple of hours later they arrived at the battle arena.  &#34;We should have just rode on Red Fang.&#34;  Yeoj said. <BR>	&#34;I didn&#39;t want him getting worn out before the tournament.&#34;  Elyk said in a snappy voice. <BR>	&#34;Why are you participating in this tournament?&#34;  Sivart asked Atries. <BR>	&#34;The top five trainers are required to participate in this tournament.  As you know, I am now ranked third.  That means that I have to participate.&#34;   Atries walked in the front door. <BR>	&#34;Does that mean we are going to have to battle against the strongest monsters in the world?&#34;  Sivart asked. <BR>	&#34;Yep.&#34;  Elyk looked over and smiled.  <BR>	They went to the registration counter and signed up to be in the tournament.  &#34;You guys are going to have it tough, this is a ten monster, elimination, tournament.  The top six, and the 9th and 10th monsters ranked in world are in this.  You two are really going to have a hard time.&#34;  The clerk said as she stamped Nova&#39;s and Red Fang&#39;s papers. <BR>	&#34;They&#39;ll do fine.&#34;  Atries said as he pushed his slip over to her.  She went to stamp it and then stopped.  She grabbed another stamp that, instead of having a big S on it, had a big 3 on it, above it in small letter it said, &#34;rank&#34;. <BR>	&#34;Okay let&#39;s go!&#34;  Elyk said as they walked toward the S class arena.  &#34;See ya later Yeoj.&#34; <BR>	Yeoj looked over, &#34;I&#39;ll see you guys after my tournament, there&#39;s only eight monsters in it.&#34; <BR>	The first battle was Red Fang versus the rank # 9 monster in the world.  It was a golem sub-type gali.  It looked just like a normal golem only was white and gold.  Elyk checked it with his vision goggles.  &#34;A strength level of only 3200, huh?  We can do it Red Fang, we&#39;re stronger than he is.&#34; <BR>	The announcer began to speak, &#34;Our first battle will be the 9th highest ranked monster in the world, Golden Giant, versus a newcomer to S-class, Red Fang!&#34;  People cheered as the two monsters walked out into the battle arena.  &#34;Fight!&#34; <BR>	Golden Giant began charging at Red Fang as fast as he could, which wasn&#39;t very fast.  Red Fang took a deep breath and let the flames fly.  Golden Giant ran straight through them and grabbed hold of Red Fang, picked him up and slammed him down, picked him and slammed him down again, picked him up, and Red Fang began flying into the air, Golden Giant held on squeezing with all his might.  Red Fang reached the top of the arena and then feet first plummeted toward the ground using his wings to make them fall faster.  Golden Giant was smashed into the ground with Red Fang on top of him.  Red Fang flew up into the air and shot a blast of flames down toward the Golden Giant.  Golden Giant stood up with the flames beating down on his back.  He then jumped up through the flames and grabbed Red Fang, Red Fang unprepared fell underneath Golden Giant&#39;s weight.  Golden Giant held on to Red Fang&#39;s feet as they went toward the ground.  Golden Giant hit the ground first and landed on his feet, with Red Fang&#39;s feet in hands he slammed Red Fang into the ground.  He then let go and came down with a strong chop right down to crush Red Fang into nothing.  Red Fang looked up and saw the hand coming down and caught it with his hands and then pulled himself up feet first and kicked Golden Giant in the chest and did a back flip landing on his feet.  He then took an even bigger breath than before and flew toward Golden Giant, he clawed Golden Giant&#39;s head twice then swung his feet forward and hit Red Fang in the chest, used it as leverage and did a backflip in the air and then shot a large blast of fire hitting Golden Giant hard and strong.  Golden Giant stumbled back and then fell, out cold.  &#34;Oh my gosh, the winner is, Red Fang!!&#34;  The announce sounded truly shocked. <BR>	&#34;The next battle will be the 10th strongest monster in the world, Puffball, versus another newcomer to S-class, Nova.  Here with us we have the winner of the last battle, Elyk and Red Fang.  So now you guys might be taken in consideration for being ranked in world, how do you feel about that?&#34; <BR>	&#34;Well,&#34; Elyk began, &#34;We plan to go all the way, this is just another step for us.  I&#39;d like to talk about this next battle, if I may.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Well go ahead.&#34;  The announcer answered the rhetorical question. <BR>	&#34;I think this next battle I&#39;m going to go with Nova.  Nova is a Pulsar, or a Hare/Tiger for those of you who don&#39;t know the names, and I train with him.  He is almost as strong as Red Fang and he&#39;s got the moves to back it up.&#34;   <BR>	&#34;If you say so, are you ready Puffball, Nova?&#34;  The announcer looked down at the arena at the two monsters who shook their heads yes. &#34;Okay then, Fight!&#34; <BR>	Elyk looked down at Puffball with his vision goggles, &#34;3210, yeah Nova will win.&#34; <BR>	Nova ran at the Puffball as fast as he could, Puffball shot some flower petals at Nova who just ran straight into him, then realized he made a major mistake.  Each petal was hard as a rock and was sharp like a razor blade, Nova was getting all cut up and didn&#39;t know what to do. &#34;Nova!&#34;  Sivart screamed from the sidelines. &#34;Use your foul gas attack!&#34;  Nova bent over and let a large cloud of green gas out.  The petals all dissolved.  Nova jumped back and was ready to fight.  Puffball shot another blast of petals at him, Nova easily jumped out of the way.  Puffball shot a small laser at Nova who batted it away from him.  Nova then smiled and began running at Puffball, Puffball took in a deep breath of air and just about quadrupled in size.  It then jumped up and went into the position called a &#34;cannonball&#34; when diving, it came down straight on Nova, who ran out of the way barely being missed.  Puffball shrank down to normal size and then opened its mouth.  A large pink beam with sparkles flying all about it came hurtling toward Nova, Nova jumped over it toward Puffball who was about twenty-feet away, Nova seemed to glide through the air and hit Puffball with a kick straight into it&#39;s pink little head.  It stumbled back and stopped using its cannon sized beam.  Nova brought his hand back as far as he could and came with a punch right into Puffball&#39;s head who flew and hit the wall with a big bang sound.  Puffball didn&#39;t get back up. <BR>	The matches continued and they ended up like this. <BR>Golden Giant R# 9 vs. Red Fang winner Red Fang <BR>Puffball # 10 vs. Nova winner Nova <BR>Hoppy R #6 vs. Janard #5 winner Janard <BR>Hercules R #2 vs. Falcon R #4 winner Falcon <BR>Hardcore R #1 vs. Excalibur R #3 winner <BR> <BR>	&#34;The next battle will be Hardcore, the undefeated, strongest, monster in the world versus Excalibur, rank #3 in world.  This will be one hell of a battle!!&#34;  The announcer sounded genuinely excited about this.  &#34;Ready, Fight!!&#34; <BR>	Hardcore was a magic monster sub-type durahan.  He looked like a knight in his armor.  Elyk looked through his vision goggles at Hardcore.  &#34;Oh, crap.&#34; <BR>	&#34;What?&#34;  Sivart asked. <BR>	&#34;Hardcore&#39;s strength level is 5035.&#34;  Elyk eyes began to swell up in fear at the strength of the monster. <BR>	&#34;What, that can&#39;t be right!  How strong is Excalibur!?&#34; <BR>	Elyk looked over at Excalibur. &#34;He&#39;s at a strength level of...... 4270.  That&#39;s not nearly strong enough.&#34;  Elyk stood up.  &#34;You can do it Excalibur!!&#34; <BR>	Sivart stood up to, &#34;You&#39;re a better fighter, you can do it!!&#34; <BR>	Excalibur stood and looked at Hardcore.  Hardcore smiled and began walking forward slowly toward Excalibur.  Excalibur backed up a little bit, then stopped and put both his arms out.  Both of his fists turned into drills and shot forward at Hardcore who disappeared and reappeared out of the way.  He then pointed his hand at Excalibur and began shooting little energy bullets at Excalibur rapidly.  Excalibur dodged a few and then was hit by one and knocked back, he was stunned and a couple more were about to hit him when his hands turned into little cannons and began picking off the little energy bullets that were flying at Excalibur.  Hardcore stopped, smiled again and energy appeared in his hands shaped like a violin.  He squeezed it and a ripple of sound shot forth toward Excalibur who dodged it, the was hit by another one and fell to the ground, holding its chest.  It sat there for a second and then Hardcore was there next to him.  Hardcore spoked, &#34;You weren&#39;t even worth my time.&#34;  With that he surrounded himself with energy, the energy floated off of him and engulfed him, &#34;Psychic blow!!&#34; he yelled and then went to smash into Excalibur, Excalibur pulled both his laser cutters out and jumped from his squatting positions and the laser cutters went up and slashed the Hardcore and then Excalibur pushed off of Hardcore&#39;s chest with his feet and landed a few feet away from him.  &#34;That&#39;s better.&#34;  Hardcore was injured badly, but he acted as though it hadn&#39;t even hurt him.  Hardcore&#39;s energy faded away and his fist lit up with fire he swung hard ate Excalibur who went into a fold up position &#40;Hengers could fold up into something that looked like just their head with four little feet sticking out&#41; and then went back to normal form and did a low kick right into Hardcore&#39;s shin, then with a heavy chop Excalibur went to finish it, Hardcore disappeared and reappeared about 20 feet away.  &#34;Didn&#39;t think you were going to get me that easy did you?&#34;  He walked forward and Excalibur held out his arm, the hand turned into a cannon and Excalibur held it up with his other hand. <BR>	&#34;Excalibur shoot the ground right in front of him.  Then run forward with your laser swords out.&#34;  Atries spoke just loud enough from the sidelines so Excalibur could hear him.  Excalibur shot the ground right in front of hardcore then rushed forward, Hardcore reappeared right in front of the blast unprepared for Excalibur to be there.  Excalibur slashed with both swords at the same time, his arms starting out like an X.  Hardcore disappeared and reappeared a couple of feet away, one of the swords had caught him and he was hurt.  He surrounded himself with energy and rushed at Excalibur full speed.  Excalibur was hit and flew back, hit the ground, got back up and electricity surged through his body.   <BR>	&#34;Time up!!&#34;  The announcer announced.  &#34;In a moment I will get the judges stats.&#34;  Chatter arose in the crowd.  &#34;The stats are, percent of life left, Hardcore, 5%; Excalibur, 5%.  Okay, who had more life left, Hardcore, who hit more often, Excalibur, who used more guts, it&#39;s a tie.  This makes the match a tie.  Both monsters will be eliminated from the tournament as if they had never entered, this will neither count as a loss or a win.  It will not be put on either monster&#39;s record.  The next battle will be Janard vs. Nova then Falcon vs. Red fang.&#34; <BR>	Janard was a metalner.  A silver/chrome colored monster that was short and looked round.  It was made of metal and its arms were like slinkies, they could stretch and contract. &#34;Ready, Fight!!&#34; The announcer said unexpectedly.  Janard came forward slowly at Nova.  Elyk looked at Janard, 3400, not to strong.  Nova could take him.  Janard came forward and swung his arm at Nova from about five feet away.  Nova dodged it, but then it twisted and managed to still hit Nova.  Nova wasn&#39;t to hurt by it and ran forward, he began pounding on Janard hitting on him over and over, then Nova pulled his arm back as far as he could and hit Janard right in the chest.  Janard wrapped stood there, unfazed, then wrapped its arms around Nova and began squeezing, Nova broke free easily and jumped back.  Then jumped forward with a spin and gave a kick right into Janard&#39;s chest.  Janard stumbled a little, but didn&#39;t fall over.  He then blasted a little beam at Nova which Nova dodged and then punched Janard again.  Janard then pushed both his arms forward as hard as he could and hit Nova hard.  Nova stumbled back, but still didn&#39;t seem fazed, he then jumped forward hit him once then twice and jumped back.  Janard then turned his back to Nova and charged to him.  Nova stumbled again, this time he looked a little hurt.  Nova then pulled his arm back as far as he could and hit Janard again.  Janard stumbled back and fell over.  It then got up and shot another beam at Nova.  Nova moved out of the way, but the beam curved and hit Nova.  Nova was hurt bad now, he struggled to his feet and then with all his might jumped forward and gave a kick straight into Janard&#39;s chest, the dropped and gave a couple punches before just hitting Janard as hard as he could.  Janard stumbled back and fell.  Nova waited, Janard wasn&#39;t getting back up.  &#34;The winner is Nova!!&#34;  The announcer boomed throughout the stadium.  &#34;The next battle will be Falcon vs. Red Fang!&#34; <BR>	Red Fang and Falcon stepped into the arena.  &#34;A phoenix.&#34;  Elyk said to himself.  He then put on his vison goggles.  &#34;3603.  That isn&#39;t a good thing.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Ready, Fight!&#34; The announcer yelled it this time with eagerness.  Falcon lifted his wings and jumped into the air, a large wave of lava came flying toward Red Fang.  Red Fang looked up in horror the wave fell upon Red Fang and he fell.  &#34;The winner of this battle is Falcon!!&#34;  The announcer sounded overly happy. <BR>	&#34;Red Fang, no!&#34;  Elyk wiped his tears on his sleeve. <BR>	Red Fang slowly got to his feet stood up, his entire body smoking, fire flaring from his nostrils, gritting his teeth, he opened his mouth and roared.  &#34;Wait! The battle isn&#39;t over, Red Fang is getting back up!!&#34;  The announcer yelled.  Red Fang became surrounded with fire and flew toward Falcon.  Falcon shot a large beam at Red Fang.  Red Fang froze, he couldn&#39;t dodge it and if he got hit again he was going to be injured.  Red Fang smiled, he stuck out his hands, the beam hit his hands with such force that Red Fang began getting pushed back.  Falcon continued to shoot the beam without relent.  In front of Red Fang a small ball was forming from the energy of the beam.  It was getting bigger and bigger.  Red Fang was glowing he was so furious from that first hit, he let go of the beam for a second and then gave a thrust with both palms forward and hit the ball of energy that had formed.  It smashed through the beam that Falcon had created and hit Falcon in an explosion, people piled out of the way of the explosion.  Part of the arena had been incinerated, a large piece of seats and the wall were gone. Falcon, without the fire was just a giant orange bird.  Then it stood back up and lit on fire.  Red Fang stared in amazement at the willpower of this monster, any other monster would have passed out, given up, but not Falcon.  It squawked and rose its wings into the air, a stream of lava and fire came hurtling across the ground at Red Fang.  Red Fang flew into the air so he wouldn&#39;t get hit.  Falcon then shot a fire ball from its mouth at Red Fang, Red Fang caught it and threw it back, Falcon dodged it and then flapped his wings which a tornado of fire flew from its wings at Red Fang.  Red Fang took a deep breath and the entire tornado went into his mouth.  Red Fang flew down toward Falcon and spit it, Falcon was hit and flew into the stands and laid down, paramedics came in and then delivered a message to the announcer.  The announcer spoke, &#34;It seems that Falcon is injured, he will be taken to the hospital.   We have one battle left, the monsters that will be battling are Nova and Red Fang.  We were told earlier that they train together, what a coincidence that they are the final monsters that have to fight.  There will be a half an hour intermission in order for Red Fang to rest and the audience to get drinks and go to the bathroom.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Are you ready Nova?&#34;  Sivart asked.  Nova looked up and shook his head no. <BR>	&#34;Hey, are you guys ready?&#34;  Red Fang and Elyk walked in.  &#34;Are you?&#34; <BR>	&#34;Yeah we&#39;re ready.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Well, I don&#39;t expect Nova to go easy on Red Fang or Red Fang on Nova just because they&#39;re friends.&#34;  Elyk smiled. <BR>	&#34;Yeah.&#34;  Sivart looked at Red Fang and Nova. <BR>	They walked to their sides of the Arena.  This was it, for the S class championship, and a ranking in the world.  When the announcer said fight it was if nothing had happened, Nova and Red Fang continued standing there, looking at each other, waiting for the other to make a move.  Red Fang was the first one to make a move.  He looked at Nova and shot a small burst of fire, just to get things moving.  Nova easily jumped out of the way and then ran at Red Fang, Nova jumped and gave a strong kick into Red Fang&#39;s stomach.  Red Fang caught Nova off the rebound of his chest and slammed him into the ground.  He then kicked him and chased after Nova as Nova flew through the air.  Nova saw Red Fang coming and as soon as Nova hit the ground he jumped out of the way, Red Fang went flying past mouth open.  Nova came from Red Fang&#39;s side and head butted him, giving a hard straight he then began rapidly punching Red Fang.  Red Fang turned toward Nova, picked Nova up in his mouth and began squeezing with all the muscles in his jaw.  Nova screamed in pain, then let out a large cloud of gas inside Red Fang&#39;s mouth.  Red Fang spit Nova out stumbled back and began coughing and spitting.  Nova ran toward Red Fang and jumped into the air and came down with a both hands together right into Red Fang&#39;s head, he then gave a strong uppercut and jumped back.  Nova landed about five feet away and panted a little, he was out of energy and needed to rest for a second while Red Fang was stunned. <BR>	Red Fang shook it off and looked up at Nova.  Red Fang was obviously hurt, but Nova wasn&#39;t it very good condition either, there were puncture holes on parts of his body where Red Fang had bitten him.  Red Fang smiled at Nova, then flew at him full speed.  Nova went to jump out of the way, but Red Fang caught him with one hand and put him back in his place.  Then Red Fang using his wings to keep him afloat, began rapidly kicking Nova in the head, then using Nova as leverage pushed off into the air and blew a large ball of fire down at Nova.  Red Fang then dropped full speed down on top of Nova with both feet.  Red Fang stood there for a second to make sure Nova was out cold, then got off and began walking toward Elyk who was in the trainer box on the sidelines.  Nova struggled to his feet and saw Red Fang walking away.  Nova smiled, this was his chance he could get a cheap shot in and win it, but that would be fighting dirty.  Nova ran at Red Fang and jumped right up and over him.  As he was above Red Fang he kicked him on top of the head and then landed in front of Red Fang.  Nova smiled and with his boxing glove like hand he made the movement as to say come here.  Then Nova seemed to begin concentrating, with that he brought his fist back and with all his might he punched Red Fang in the stomach.  Red Fang grabbed his stomach and fell to his knees, Nova then gave a hard straight into Red Fang&#39;s head, which knocked him over.  Nova raised his arms as if he hand won.  Red Fang rolled over and got up, back turned to Nova, then, with his tail, Red Fang began slapping Nova back and forth across the face.  Nova blocked with one arm and then slapped the tail away from him.  Jumping in the air Nova landed on Red Fang&#39;s back and with his little two rabbit teeth in front bit into Red Fang&#39;s shoulder.  Red Fang folded his wings int then catapulted Nova off with them.  Red Fang then began slapping Nova with his wings, back and forth.  Then Red Fang stopped and punched Nova right in the head.  Nova fell over, Red Fang stood there waiting for a minute to see if Nova was getting up and then began walking slowly backwards keeping his eyes on Nova. <BR>	&#34;The winner of this battle is........ Red Fang!!!!&#34;  The announcer yelled so loud that it echoed throughout the arena and rang in people&#39;s ears.  Everyone watched in awe as Red Fang backed away until he got to his corner and left the arena.   <BR>	Sivart ran out into the arena and picked up Nova in his arms.  &#34;Hey, get some medics out here!!&#34;  Medics ran out into the arena and picked up Nova on a stretcher like device, &#34;Take him to our room in the coliseum and lay him down, he&#39;ll be okay.&#34;  Sivart told the medics to do so and they left immediately. <BR>	Everyone was outside the arena standing together.  &#34;You two fought well, you should be proud.  You&#39;re now ranked in the world.   What rank did you two get?&#34;  Atries tried to crack a smile, but failed. <BR>	&#34;I got rank 6 in world and Sivart got rank 8 in world.&#34;  Elyk gave the, let&#39;s not talk about it look. <BR>	&#34;Well at least I beat A class.  It was darn hard to, me and One-Eye almost lost at every battle, but One-Eye slapped them around with his big tongue and eventually, we won.&#34;  Yeoj smiled big and then added, &#34;One-Eye also got a lot stronger.  Didn&#39;t you One-Eye?&#34;  He patted One-Eye on the head.  With that they began walking toward Elyk&#39;s ranch in silence.

 Part 2 <BR> <BR>February 1, 1063 <BR>	Nova pounded the punching bag, left, right, left, right, left, left, then one big right.  His fist when right through the punching bag and it broke off its chain.  Nova slid it off his arm and then began kicking it on the ground.  He kicked it repeatedly harder and harder, until eventually nothing was left of it. <BR>	Outside Red Fang pulled 15,000 lbs. of bricks with a rope up the hill.  Then he added a brick, took the sled back to the bottom and began pulling it back up again.  He reached the top walked over to the pile of bricks, picked it up over his head and began flying as high as he could.  At first he could barely get a foot off the ground, but he was getting higher and now he was up to about 30 feet.  He dropped and hit the ground letting the bricks fall on top of him and break over his body.  Red Fang stood up, bricks piling off of him, and began putting the broken bricks back on the sled to pull up and down the hill. <BR>	Excalibur kept very silent and still.  He looked at the ocean shore where a large zilla stood digging in the sand for crabs to eat.  Excalibur crawled down the cliff&#39;s face toward the ocean.  He dropped in and began swimming underwater until he reached the shore.  He poked his head up out of the water to catch the zilla eating a crab.  Excalibur jumped up out of the water and landed next to the zilla.  The zilla took a swipe at Excalibur which Excalibur easily dodged.  Excalibur then pushed the zilla in one of the holes it had dug and then jumped in the ocean and began swimming back home.   <BR>	One Eye ate some vitamin D then began levitating itself into the air.   Using his mind he pictured somewhere he wanted to go.  He opened his eyes, he was there.  Looking around he found he was in the forest he had pictured.  Concentrating real hard he created a barrier of energy around him, then he blasted it away from him sending it bashing through trees and anything else that got its way.  One Eye then teleported back to Elyk&#39;s house and began concentrating on going to the mountains. <BR>	A phoenix came flying up.  Elyk walked up to it and took a letter from its mouth.  It said: To all trainers, the city of Trente is under attack.  Your assistance is required.  Please come straight to Trente to help battle the incoming hordes of wild monsters.  -Jake Summers, Mayor of Trente <BR>	&#34;You guys, we have to go to Trente, it is being attacked by the monsters!&#34;  Elyk yelled to Sivart, Yeoj, and Atries.  &#34;Red Fang!!!  We have to go now!!&#34;  Elyk yelled to Red Fang and he came flying up. <BR>	&#34;One Eye!!&#34;  Yeoj yelled.  &#34;We gotta go, come here.&#34;  One Eye appeared in front of Yeoj. <BR>	&#34;Nova, we&#39;re leaving come on!!&#34;  Sivart yelled and Nova came running out of the gym. <BR>	Excalibur came walking up. Atries smiled, &#34;Right on time as always, we&#39;re leaving, Trente is being attacked.&#34;  Excalibur beeped a few times and then they all got in a group. <BR>	&#34;Ready One Eye, think you can teleport us to Trente?&#34;  One Eye nodded his big eye- head.  Then they disappeared.   <BR>	&#34;Where are we?&#34;  Elyk looked around.  &#34;I don&#39;t think One Eye hit his mark.  Red Fang, fly up into the air and see if you see any cities in the distance.  Red Fang flew into the air and then pointed.  He came down and in the sand drew a little arrow.  Everyone looked that way. <BR>	&#34;How did we miss that?&#34;  Sivart asked. <BR>	&#34;We were all looking this way instead of that way.&#34;  Atries put simply. &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34; <BR>	They arrived within a couple of minutes.  The mayor came running up.  &#34;I&#39;m Jake Summers the mayor.  Oh, It&#39;s you guys.  The monsters are at the North end of the town.  Please go there.&#34;  Jake pointed the way. <BR>	The all hopped on Red Fang&#39;s back and began flying toward the North end of the town.  They came and from above saw a huge army fighting another huge army.  &#34;It&#39;s huge.&#34;  Elyk sounded amazed.  They landed in back and then were attacked from the sides.  A zuum came and spit a large flaming rock at Red Fang.  Red Fang caught it and threw it back and hit the zuum.   <BR>	Nova dodged a hopper&#39;s punches. &#40;A hopper is a creature that has a face like a raccoon only it is completely gray with the black, they have little skinny arms and little legs like a rabbits, the stand straight up and aren&#39;t very tall&#41;.  Nova dodged left then right then gave a straight right into the hopper&#39;s head knocking it out.   <BR>	Excalibur jumped high into the air and came down on a baku &#40;a large monster that has an elephant body only it has a really light brown hair covering everything up, it&#39;s head was big and it had big floppy ears and big cheeks and a wide nose, and big eyes&#41; and began flipping in midair hitting it over and over until it collapsed on the ground.  <BR>	One Eye shot a laser from its mouth across the battle field and hit a golem, the golem fell and then got back up and looked around.  One Eye teleported over there, floated into the air, and then One Eye began slapping the golem across the face with his tongue.  The golem fell to pieces and hit the ground. <BR>	Elyk found a pixie sub-type plant and began throwing punches at her.  She dodged left then right and slapped Elyk across the face.  Elyk kicked her in the stomach and then punched her across the face, she fell to the ground. <BR>	Sivart tackled a centaur.  As it tried getting up he began kicking it and knocking it back down.  Sivart gave a strong kick to its head and it passed out.  He looked around and was hit by a pixie&#39;s ray in the chest.  He got up and ran toward the pixie.  The pixie slapped him across the face and then kicked him in the shins. He grabbed his leg and stumbled back. <BR>	Yeoj ran full speed toward a suezo, he punted it like a football and it flew across the battle field.  He turned around and saw a skipper &#40;hopper sub-type tiger&#41; standing there.  Yeoj grabbed it between his legs and began squeezing as hard as he could. <BR>	Atries pulled a sword out of his backpack.  It was a sword that was supposed to be used when combining monsters to get a durahan.  It had a jagged edge and was extremely sharp.  Atries turned and saw a tyrant &#40;a golem sub-type dragon, it was red with little wings and a small dragon head&#41; standing there.  It came down with its hand down toward Atries.  Atries jumped out of the way barely getting missed.  He stood up and thrust forward and stabbed it in the stomach.  He pulled sword out of the Tyrant and it fell over.  Fire bursted from the hole and burned nearby monsters, Atries ran out of range to be hit and turned to see a hare, he ran toward it and swung his sword..... <BR>	The battle was coming to an end.  Both sides had very few numbers left.  &#34;Regroup!!&#34; Elyk yelled and ran back to the side opposite the monsters. <BR>	&#34;He said Regroup people!!&#34;  Atries yelled and everyone ran back toward Elyk.  The monsters looked in amazement.  There were only about twenty people and monsters left on the side of the humans. <BR>	&#34;They have at least 50 monsters left.&#34;  Sivart looked at the monsters which were now also regrouping. <BR>  	Death walked out to the middle of the battle field.  &#34;We offer you the chance to leave without losing your lives, but we will get the city.&#34;  He chuckled a little bit.  &#34;If you don&#39;t accept we will have to kill you.&#34;  Selina flew up next to him.  Then Crusher walked up and Reaper floated up.  Chuck came up doing flips with an evil little grin. <BR>	&#34;Measure their strength.&#34;  Atries looked over at Elyk. <BR>	&#34;Okay.&#34;  Elyk walked over to his backpack on the ground.  He took his scanner out and looked at the group of monsters standing in the center of the battle field, &#34;Death is at  3943, Selina is at 3619, Crusher is at 3582, Reaper is at 3227, and Chuck is at 3577.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Do you think we can take them?&#34;  Sivart asked. <BR>	&#34;Like us four on their five?&#34;   Elyk asked. <BR>	&#34;Yeah.&#34;  Sivart said. <BR>	&#34;Why?&#34; <BR>	&#34;Maybe we can challenge them, if we win they leave for now, if they win, we leave for now.&#34;  Sivart smiled. <BR>	&#34;Let me see, their total strength is, 17948.  Our total strength is,&#34; Elyk looked at Red Fang, pushed a button, looked at One-Eye, pushed a button, looked at Excalibur, pushed a button, and finally looked at Nova and pushed a button.  &#34;Our strength is 14209.  I seriously don&#39;t think we could win.&#34; <BR>	At that moment a large carriage came up.  The two baku that were pulling it huffed.  The side opened and out stepped the trainer Sutal.  The other side opened up and Hardcore stepped out.  Sutal spoke, &#34;No need to worry, Hardcore is here.&#34; <BR>	Hardcore chuckled a little and then added, &#34;Where&#39;s the enemy?&#34;  He looked over at Excalibur, &#34;I&#39;m lookin forward to a rematch, got it?&#34;    <BR>	&#34;We&#39;ll have him help us fight, then we couldn&#39;t lose.&#34;  Elyk looked at the magic monster and smiled. <BR>	Atries spoke up, &#34;We&#39;re going to try to convince them to have a five on five match, we need a fifth monster to help.&#34; <BR>	Sutal spoke, &#34;Hardcore will fight, but the rest of your monsters better help him.&#34; <BR>	&#34;They will.&#34;  Elyk smiled looking confident. <BR>	&#34;Do not speak to me, you are not above rank five in world, if you ever are, then you can speak to me.&#34;  Sutal&#39;s facial expression never seemed to change.  He was short and had a light brown hair.  He was in a off-white robe with the hood hanging down behind him. <BR>	&#34;I will go talk to them.&#34;  Elyk walked out toward the center of the battle field.  Red Fang followed closely behind.  &#34;We challenge you to a five on five match, the winner stays in the city and the loser has to leave.&#34; <BR>	Death&#39;s eye lit up, &#34;No.&#34; <BR>	&#34;What do you mean no.  It&#39;s a perfectly good, fair deal.&#34;  Elyk started to raise his voice. <BR>	&#34;I mean no.  We have two or three times as many soldiers as you and we can easily win this war.  We don&#39;t care about what&#39;s fair.  We&#39;re going to win this war and take over the city.  This city has three labs.  We&#39;ll get a lot of disc stones that we need.  Not to mention that this is one of the largest cities in the world, so each lab is humongous.   We need this city and we&#39;ll take it any way we can get it.&#34;  Death would be smiling with confidence that his army was going to win if he had a mouth. <BR>	&#34;Red Fang, let&#39;s go.&#34;  Elyk began walking back to his side of battleground.  Death put his arm up and shot a blast out of it at Elyk&#39;s back.  Red Fang saw the shot and blocked it with one his hands.  Then turned, Selina shot a huge flame toward Red Fang and Elyk. <BR>	&#34;Look!&#34;  Sivart pointed toward the center of the battlefield where Red Fang was blocking blasts from the five monsters.  &#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34;  Sivart and Nova began running out there. <BR>	Death turned to his monster army.  &#34;Attack!&#34;  The army began running forward toward Elyk and Red Fang. <BR>	&#34;Attack!&#34;  Atries yelled to the human army which began running toward the center of the battlefield. <BR>	Nova punched Selina in the head knocking her to the ground.  She stood up and chuckled.   &#34;Do you think a pathetic monster like you could beat me?  You don&#39;t stand a chance.&#34;  Selina flew into the air and began shooting blasts of lightning down at Nova.  Nova dodged one after another then got hit and knocked to the ground.  He rolled out of the way of a large fire ball and jumped into the air at Selina.  Selina moved out of the way when he left the ground.  She then shot a fireball and Nova fell to the ground, he didn&#39;t move and a lot of his hair was burned off. <BR>	Death looked at the Magic monster that stood in front of him wearing armor.  &#34;You don&#39;t stand a chance, give up while you&#39;re ahead.&#34; <BR>	The Magic monster smiled, &#34;My name is Hardcore, I&#39;m the last monster you&#39;ll ever face.&#34;  With that he ran at Death full speed. Death tried to move out of the way but was rammed to the ground.  Death kicked at Hardcore, but Hardcore disappeared and reappeared behind Death.  Hardcore then began to glow with energy, Death stood up and turned around both laser swords extended from his wrists.  Hardcore slammed into him and sent him flying across the battlefield.  Hardcore smashed through dozens of monsters to get to Death.  Death shot a large of blast of energy from one of his hands as Hardcore.  Hardcore walked through it looking almost unfazed.  He then grabbed Death by the chest, crushing the metal in his hand for a grip and picked Death up off the ground.   <BR>	&#34;You can&#39;t kill me.  I am Death, the leader of this army.  We are for monsters, we are here to free you, you won&#39;t be a slave to humanity anymore.  Put me down and you can join my side.&#34;  Death pleaded with Hardcore. <BR>	&#34;No deal.&#34;  Hardcore began glowing with energy and then he began rapidly shooting energy blasts from his hand into the chest of Death, he let go of Death and Death slowly floated higher and higher into the air lifted by the force of the small energy blasts hitting him the chest.  Hardcore stopped and Death fell to the ground.  Hardcore walked over to Death.  &#34;Your a pathetic monster, not fit to lead anything.&#34;  With that he crushed the metal head of Death with his boot and turned to see a pixie flying in the air.  In his hands appeared energy in the shape of a violin, he shot a wave of force up at Selina.  Selina was hit and fell to the ground dead.   <BR>	Red Fang picked the wracky in his mouth and closed it, killing the wracky.  Chuck came walking up. He pointed his little razor blade at Red Fang and then threw it him.  Red Fang caught it threw it to the ground and broke it underneath his heel.  Chuck began growling and laughing hysterically at the same time.  He then ran at Red Fang and jumped into the air and shot a large blast of fire at Red Fang, Red Fang shot a blast of his fire back.  They collided in the air and Chuck&#39;s went through Red Fang&#39;s and hit Red Fang.  Red Fang flew into the air and looked down at Chuck.  He began spitting little bursts of fire at Chuck. Chuck was hit and fell to the ground.  He got up and looked at Red Fang, he then took off his little doll head and began doing a one-handed hand stand on it.  Red Fang looked around and everything was wavy, he then fell to the ground.  Chuck walked up and kicked Red Fang in the head.  Red Fang reached over and grabbed Chuck in his hand, crushing Chuck in his hand and continued laying there waiting for the world to stop spinning.   <BR>	Excalibur looked at Reaper.  Reaper chuckled an evil little laugh and then shot a blast of energy at Excalibur.  Excalibur was hit and stumbled back.   The sky then went black and Reaper got into a crouching position.  Excalibur looked around and then saw Reaper flying at him full speed his sickle extended toward Excalibur.  Excalibur dodged out of the way and kicked Reaper in the side.  He then pulled out his laser sword and came down right on Reaper.  Reaper hit the ground and didn&#39;t move. <BR>	Crusher looked around and saw all his dead comrades.  He roared and began charging through the battle field hitting and injuring or killing humans and monsters and anything that got his way.  A tear stayed in his eye.  He came up to Red Fang who shot a blast of fire at him.  Crusher stumbled and smiled.  He grabbed Red Fang with both hands and began slamming him into every thing he could.  He then jumped into the air and put Red Fang underneath him, he landed on top of Red Fang crushing him.  He got off of Red Fang and smiled.  Then was hit from behind.  He turned around to see a magic monster in armor.  &#34;I am Hardcore, and that monster is my ally.&#34;  He then began glowing with energy and slammed into Crusher.  Crusher stumbled backwards, but then caught hold of Hardcore.  He picked him up into the air with both hands and began squeezing.  Hardcore struggled to get free, but could not move.  He looked up toward the heavens, knowing soon he would be there.  Then saw a large Red Dragon flying down toward him and Crusher.  It landed right on Crusher smashing him into the ground.  Crusher struggled to his feet and then roared again and began running away.  The rest of the monster army followed him. <BR>	&#34;We won!&#34;   Elyk yelled as all the monsters ran away.  Red Fang came walking up carrying Nova in his arms.  &#34;Sivart, come on we have to get Nova to the hospital!!  Yeoj, we need One Eye to teleport us to the hospital, now!!&#34;   <BR>	&#34;Did you hear him One Eye?&#34;  Yeoj yelled to One Eye in the distance.  One Eye nodded then he teleported himself, Yeoj, Elyk, Red Fang, Sivart and Nova to the hospital.  They all ran into the hospital. <BR>	&#34;We need some medical assistance now!&#34;  Elyk yelled at the nurse.  She nodded and pushed a button.  A medical team came running up with a mobile bed.  Red Fang lied Nova in it then they were gone.   <BR>	&#34;We&#39;ll need the trainer to fill out these papers please.&#34;  The nurse had a real nasal shrilled voice. <BR>	Sivart took the papers and sat down in a chair and began filling them out.  Elyk sat down too, then Yeoj followed.  Red Fang sat on the floor and One Eye curled up in a ball on one of the chairs.  They all sat and waited for information on Nova.	 <BR>	&#34;Looks like we won.&#34;  Atries looked over at Sutal. <BR>	Sutal looked over at Atries expressionless, &#34;Looks like it.&#34; <BR>	&#34;My Excalibur is going to beat you&#39;re Hardcore.&#34;  Atries smiled in challenge. <BR>	&#34;No, your Excalibur isn&#39;t strong enough.&#34;  Sutal&#39;s eyes slightly slanted and the corners of his mouth went up slightly.   <BR>	&#34;He will be soon.&#34;  Atries stated. <BR>	&#34;Well, let&#39;s go.&#34;  Sutal&#39;s face went back to his no expression. <BR>	&#34;To the hospital.&#34;  Atries started walking down the city street. <BR>	&#34;Why to the hospital?&#34;  Sutal asked. <BR>	&#34;We have to see how Nova is doing.&#34;  Atries stopped and turned.  &#34;Sivart is the trainer of Nova.  Him and Elyk are my only friends, I care about them and their monsters.&#34; <BR>	&#34;We&#39;ll take my carriage.&#34;  Sutal got in his carriage and Hardcore got in the other side.  Atries and Excalibur got in and looked around, soft seats covered with a type of fur and it had room for about eight people.  &#34;Baku! Go!&#34;  Sutal yelled and they began moving. <BR>	Crusher and what was left of the monster army sat in a cave.  Crusher was thinking about what he was going to do next.  He couldn&#39;t figure out what he was going to do.  He had a small army of about 40 monsters and he could probably take over a small town, but after he got all the cds and got the monsters he wouldn&#39;t know why he was taking towns over.  Death and Selina had planned everything out and had known what was going on.  He looked at what was left of his previous team of monsters.  Death was in pieces, Selina looked pale and wasn&#39;t moving, Chuck was so taken apart it would take years to piece him back together, Reaper had a large sword shaped cut out of his side, and Branch&#39;s ashes sat in a little golden pot with a lid.  There was only one thing to do.  Crusher had been told this many times, along with the rest of the team, if the team was destroyed except one of them, the last one was to the lab they had built in the very back of the cave and be combined with what was left of the previous monsters.  Chances were it would cause some horrible mutation and kill the last of the monsters.  Death had a way around this though, him and Selina programmed a cd rom to unscramble all the DNA code while combining so that the final monster would turn out extremely strong, instead of just a pile of mess.  Crusher had been taught to do this, so he took his old dead gang and went to the lab in the back of the cave.  He put each one in their own tube and then told the computer when the last door of tubes was shut to initiate the process.  He got in a tube and process began. <BR>					February 14, 1063 <BR>	Red Fang landed at the hospital.  Elyk had gotten a call that morning saying that Nova and Sivart needed to be picked up.  Nova was finally fully healed.  Sivart and Nova came out and got on Red Fang&#39;s back and they flew home.  For the last two weeks everyone had been resting from the battle.  A little while later Red Fang came flying up to Elyk&#39;s ranch and set them down.  They all went inside where they found Elyk, Atries and Excalibur sitting at the table.  &#34;Tomorrow we begin training again.&#34;  Elyk smiled and then took a drink of his milk. <BR>	January 1, 1064 <BR>	&#34;The tournament is over, the winner is Nova!!&#34;  The announcer rang throughout the stadium.  After this tournament Nova had been bumped up to rank 4 in world.  Red Fang was Rank 3 and Excalibur had been Rank 2 for a long time.  Soon Excalibur was scheduled to fight against Hardcore for the world championship.   <BR>	At Elyk&#39;s ranch Atries went over to Excalibur.  He handed Excalibur a silver fruit that was very similar to a peach.  &#34;Eat this, it will make you live longer.&#34;  Atries stood there and watched for a second and made sure Excalibur ate the fruit.  &#34;That&#39;s it, I&#39;ve fed you both of the Shining Fruits, nothing I can give you will make you live longer.  Now let&#39;s go fight Hardcore for the World Monster Championship.&#34;  Excalibur beeped a few times.  They began walking toward the stadium.  Nova and Excalibur were already there because they had participated in a S class tournament.   <BR>	Excalibur psyched himself up before the battle.  He pounded on a steel wall.  His fist went through it almost every time, he stopped then looked over at an electric socket in the wall.  He went over to it and pointed his middle finger and his index finger at it.  They both opened up and wires came out.  The wires went into the wall and electricity began flowing from it into Excalibur.  Excalibur&#39;s one eye began to glow and then brightened and the electricity began streaming out into Excalibur.  Little bolts of electricity surged through him and his eye continued to glow.  He knew this could be his last battle ever, not only because the opponent could kill him but he also was old and although the silver peach helped he was already supposed to be dead, he just willed his way through his death.  The silver just relieved some of the constant pain that Excalibur was in.  Atries walked in. &#34;Are you ready?&#34;  Atries smiled with excitement in his eyes, this may have been the only time in his life that Excalibur had seen Atries look so happy.  Excalibur shook his head yes and stood up. <BR>	Excalibur and Hardcore walked into the arena.  They looked straight into each other&#39;s souls.  Hardcore had come far and was determined to never lose his championship.  Excalibur was determined to win the championship, his last feat before his death.  &#34;This battle will be Hardcore vs. Excalibur, it will be for the world championship.  These monsters will be receiving no help from their trainers this battle and will have to fight this one with no help.  Now!  Let the battle begin!!&#34;  The announcer yelled and everyone in the crowd cheered. <BR>	Excalibur slowly walked toward Hardcore, they stood about a foot away from each other now and still neither made and action.  Hardcore smiled, &#34;Are..... you.... ready?&#34;  He asked in his extremely deep voice.   <BR>	Excalibur began beeping then stopped. In a robotic voice he replied, &#34;Now you will feel the true power of the ultimate weapon, Excalibur!&#34;  With that Excalibur shot multiple beams out of his eye.  Hardcore disappeared then reappeared only to be hit by a large blast from Excalibur&#39;s arm cannon.  Electricity began flowing through Excalibur&#39;s body.   Hardcore tried to kick Excalibur but Excalibur dodged to the side.  Hardcore formed a sword of energy in his hands. <BR>	&#34;Time for you to die!!  Slash Combo!!&#34;  Hardcore swung the energy sword at Excalibur who caught it between his two hands.  He kicked at Hardcore who disappeared and reappeared to get hit by a small blast from Excalibur&#39;s arm cannon.  &#34;Enough is enough, and that&#39;s all I&#39;m gonna take!&#34;  Hardcore began glowing with energy and charged toward Excalibur, Excalibur flew into the arena wall and fell to the ground.  He hit the ground out cold. <BR>	&#34;Excalibur get up!&#34;  Excalibur was in a dark place.  In front of him stood a figure of a man.  &#34;It isn&#39;t time for you to die yet, you have to win this tournament.  I can grant you the ultimate power if you win, you are the chosen one, you are the only one who can save the world from destruction.&#34;   <BR>	Excalibur&#39;s eye began glowing again and he stood up, he looked at Hardcore who was smiling a good distance across the arena.  Apparently only a second or two had passed.  The electricity in Excalibur began thrashing about and hitting the ground and the wall nearby.  Everywhere it hit a small explosion happened.  Hardcore was hit and stumble back, not hurt but shocked.  Excalibur&#39;s voice changed it now sounded like a normal male voice, Excalibur spoke just loud enough for Hardcore to hear him, &#34;Final Sword.&#34;  Excalibur began glowing with energy the jumped into the air.  A large green energy sword appeared in his hands, it caught on fire with green fire and Excalibur came down on Hardcore, Hardcore disappeared and so did Excalibur, Hardcore reappeared a couple of feet from where he had been then looked up to find Excalibur there.  Excalibur came down with it onto Hardcore&#39;s head, &#34;Sledge Fall.&#34;  Excalibur began spinning in midair hitting Hardcore over and over with the sword.  Hardcore stumbled back stunned.  Excalibur landed then an energy sword came out of each of his wrists, he went up to Hardcore and starting with his arms crossed, slashed Hardcore, ending with his hands at his sides.  Hardcore fell to the ground.  He was bleeding badly, a paramedic team came out and picked him up and carried him out. <BR>	Excalibur fell to the ground.  He was in the black place again.  The figure was there again.  &#34;Eat this to add up to two years to your life.&#34;  The figure handed Excalibur a platinum colored shining fruit.  &#34;Also take this.&#34;  The figure handed him a disc stone.  &#34;Use this and combine with the monster that is called Red Fang.  You will come out with the ultimate power, but your body will be shared by two souls, each one will be equally in charge.&#34; <BR>	Excalibur woke up in the hospital.  Atries sat next to his bed.  &#34;Are you okay?!&#34;  Atries yelled then yelled out the door, &#34;Nurse he&#39;s awake, Excalibur is awake. <BR>	Excalibur spoke in his robotic voice, &#34;I will die soon, probably within a few years.  When I am to old to fight any longer I need you to do something.  Freeze me and combine me with Red Fang using this cd.&#34;  A hologram of a cd appeared in front of Excalibur, it then solidified and fell into Excalibur&#39;s hand.   Excalibur handed it to Atries.   <BR>	Atries shook his head yes and then said, &#34;I&#39;ll talk to Elyk about it.&#34; <BR>	January 2, 1064 <BR>	&#34;No.&#34;  Elyk could not be convinced about the combining.  &#34;I need Red Fang for the next monster I train, that way it will be extremely strong as well.&#34; <BR>	&#34;How about this, we&#39;ll combine Red Fang and Excalibur together and use this,&#34; Atries showed Elyk the cd, &#34;and you can train the new monster, I have enough money to last the rest of my life anyway, all I ask is that I can stay here and help you train it.&#34;   <BR>	&#34;Well, as long as I get to train it I guess it&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s going to be a while before my Red Fang dies.&#34;  Elyk smiled. <BR>	&#34;It&#39;s a dragon, dragons usually have a short life span.  Your Red Fang is getting old for a dragon, surely you&#39;ve noticed that he isn&#39;t going up as strong as he used to.  He&#39;s getting old, I give him another year at most.&#34;  Atries was very serious. <BR>	&#34;Yeah maybe.&#34;  Elyk didn&#39;t sound to convinced. <BR>	 <BR>	The monster was completed.  It walked out of the canister that it was being held in.  It was huge, bigger than a golem.  It had previously been Crusher, Death, Selina, Branch, Chuck, and Reaper.  It now was a huge monster of destruction.  It wore henger metal armor all over its body, underneath was green, but hard like stone.  In its right hand it held a large sickle on the back of it was a knife blade. On top of its head was bright pink hair.  &#34;I am reborn!!  Now it is time for all to feel the power of Death!&#34;  It formed a small energy ball in the palm of one of its hands.  &#34;Me and my minions now have the ultimate power, I am in control, and I will take over this pathetic human infested world.&#34;  He smiled showing his large, white, sharp teeth.  Then walked into the room with his small army of monsters.  &#34;Listen up!&#34;  His voice echoed through the cave.  &#34;We&#39;re going to launch another attack on the city of Trente.  This time I guarantee that we will win.&#34;  With that he walked out of the cave and all of the monsters followed him. <BR>	January 20, 1064 <BR>	Excalibur stood with his arms crossed out in front on him.  Red Fang hit him time after time.  Excalibur stood there taking it, this would greatly increase his defense, at least for a henger.  Red Fang knew that this also would increase his strength and skill.  A couple hundred feet away Nova let One Eye&#39;s teleport attack then gave a strong gas attack right into One Eye&#39;s mouth.  There was no point in dodging or attacking with his physical attacks, Nova was maxed out in these areas.  Taking the hits and attacking with intelligence attacks would increase what he needed.  One Eye was also becoming stronger in every possible way, he was pumped up on Vitamin D and was fighting a far stronger opponent, so he would definitely get stronger. <BR>	&#34;Our monsters are going to be able to beat Hardcore soon too.  We get a lot more out of our training because our monsters have other monsters near their strength to practice against.&#34;  Elyk smiled. <BR>	&#34;Excalibur said he has exactly 1 year and 3 months left to live.  I can&#39;t figure out how he knows.&#34;  Atries frowned and then lifted the weight at his feet off the ground and flung them above his head.  He then lowered it behind his head then lifted it back up.   <BR>	Sivart pushed the weights off his chest, &#34;Maybe your monster has reached such a powerful level of strength he just knows.&#34;   <BR>	Yeoj bent down with the weights resting on his neck then stood back up, &#34;Well, One Eye is starting to get old too, I can tell.  He&#39;s only a little over four years old too. I guess it&#39;s because I pumped him up on that Vitamin D his entire life.  Well, I know he&#39;ll be strong even if he does die soon.  I&#39;m going for rank ten here soon.  In about one month I&#39;ll be ranked just like you guys.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Elyk I need to ask you something.&#34;  Atries looked over at Elyk. <BR>	&#34;What?&#34;  Elyk replied. <BR>	&#34;Have you made up your mind about the combining?&#34;  He asked. <BR>	&#34;Yeah, I guess I&#39;ll do it, where did Excalibur get the disk from again?&#34;  Elyk asked. <BR>	&#34;He made it, well that&#39;s what it seemed like to me.&#34;  Atries kept that no expression he normally had. <BR>	&#34;Maybe we should combine our monsters when they get to old to go on.&#34;  Sivart looked at Yeoj. <BR>	&#34;Yeah we could do that.&#34;  Yeoj didn&#39;t even sound the slightest bit like he didn&#39;t want to. <BR>	One Eye and Red Fang switched partners.  Red Fang and Nova began hitting and dodging, actually Nova dodged, Red Fang didn&#39;t, back and forth, One Eye began beating on Excalibur. <BR>	A phoenix landed in the middle of Elyk&#39;s yard.  It squawked and everyone came out of the gym.  Elyk took the note out of its mouth.  It said, &#34;We are under attack in Trente again, please come quickly.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Well, let&#39;s check it out and see if it&#39;s for real.  Off you go phoenix.&#34; The phoenix flew away.  &#34;One Eye, teleport us all there.&#34;  Elyk called the monsters together and they disappeared. <BR>	They were transported to the middle of what was the battlefield.  Only a couple of humans were left and the monster&#39;s army was still about the same size as they had left it at the last battle.  A large monster boomed in the back and all the monsters piled behind him.  It walked forward.  &#34;I see you are back again, well this time I will not lose.  I will kill that Hardcore monster and all of you.&#34;  Coincidentally Hardcore and Sutal came driving up.  &#34;Perfect, Hardcore, I Death challenge you to a rematch.&#34; <BR>	Hardcore stepped out and walked out to the middle of the battle field.  &#34;I accept.&#34; <BR>	Elyk looked through his vision goggles to see the strength of the two monsters, Hardcore was at 5896 and Death was at..... it was impossible, he had broken the strongest any monster could ever get which was 5994, he was at 6225. <BR>	Death reached out to grab Hardcore, Hardcore disappeared then reappeared behind Death.  With that he flared up with energy and rammed Death in the back.  Death stumbled forward then turned around smiling.  &#34;Good job Hardcore, you&#39;ve gotten even stronger since our last encounter.&#34;  With that Death jumped into the air and began flipping, electricity and a red energy surrounded him, with that he came down on top of Hardcore, both hands hitting him with a chop.  Hardcore fell to the ground, dead.   <BR>	&#34;No.&#34;  Sutal said quietly with tears in his eyes.  He then ran at Death and punched Death right into the stomach.  Death didn&#39;t move, he picked Sutal up with one hand by the leg and flung him away, Red Fang flew up into the air and caught him.  He set Sutal, who was unconscious, down. <BR>	&#34;We&#39;ll have to all fight him, he&#39;s much to strong.&#34;  Elyk said loud enough so that all the monsters could hear.   <BR>	Death raised his hand into the air and his entire monster army took a step forward.  &#34;Yes, fight me all at once, then we will fight you all at once.&#34;  He looked over at Excalibur, &#34;You&#39;re next.&#34;   <BR>	Excalibur walked forward ready to fight.  Then someone spoke up from the back, &#34;No I want One Eye to do it.&#34;  It was Yeoj, then under his breath he whispered, &#34;It&#39;s obvious we don&#39;t stand a chance, none of our monsters do, did you see how easily he took out Hardcore, I think you should go combine Red Fang and Excalibur while One Eye fights.  Hopefully that disk does something that will make the monster really strong, because otherwise we&#39;re all going to die.&#34; <BR>	Death laughed, &#34;You want me to fight this little yellow one-eyed thing?  He will surely die instantly.&#34;  With that he charged toward One Eye.  One Eye teleported about twenty feet behind him.  He turned around and charged toward One Eye, who teleported away again.   <BR>	Elyk and Atries flew off with Red Fang who held Excalibur in his paws.  Their destination was the lab.  Elyk spoke to Atries while they were flying, &#34;I don&#39;t really want to do this yet, but I guess we don&#39;t have a choice do we?&#34; <BR>	Atries turned to him, &#34;Me neither, but we have to because it is our only chance.&#34; <BR>	Death finally got a hold of One Eye and picked him up with one hand.  One Eye blasted  a laser beam from the center of his eye into Death&#39;s chest.  Death dropped him and stumbled back a couple feet.  &#34;Caught me off guard little one, but that won&#39;t happen again, I will kill you.&#34;  Death put his hands in front of him about a foot away each other.  Between them a small ball of energy began to form, Death laughed then blasted the energy toward One Eye.  One Eye jumped to the side but was still hit by the explosion.  He was tossed to the side by it and didn&#39;t move.  Yeoj ran over to him and felt his tongue.  One Eye was still alive, Yeoj could feel his pulse still beating in the center of his tongue.   <BR>	&#34;Sivart it looks like it&#39;s going to be up to Nova to hold him off until Elyk and Atries get back!&#34;  Yeoj yelled at him. <BR>	&#34;Okay.&#34;  Sivart didn&#39;t sound overly happy but nodded toward Nova and Nova walked forward to fight. <BR>	Nova was not afraid.  He knew his opponent was a lot stronger than him, but he also knew that his opponent would underestimate him.  That would give him the edge he needed to win.  If he could get off his big bang attack once or twice he knew he could do it. <BR>	&#34;Well are you just going to stand there or are you going to do something little bunny?&#34;  Death asked him. <BR>	Nova ran forward and punched at Death.  Death jumped out of the way.   He punched again, Death jumped back out of reach.  Nova went for a jump kick, Death ducked under it.  Nova then went for a one-two punch, he jumped forward and punched once, sacrificing power for speed, and hit Death in the stomach then came with another quick punch into the same spot.  Death stumbled back and then jumped into the air and began flipping.   Nova let a large amount of gas out in the direction of Death.  The green surrounded Death and Death fell to the ground.  He stood up and looked around everything spinning.  Nova ran toward him and let out a massive bunny-rabbit roar and hit Death in the stomach, it made a big bang sound and Death flew back.  Death stumbled to his feet and smiled.  His eyes began to glow.... <BR>	Atries fired everything up at the lab, he had been studying on the mechanics of how to work these machines ever since he became a monster trainer.  Elyk stood by looking at the ground.  Red Fang got in one tube and it filled up with a green liquid.  Excalibur got in a different tube and it filled up as well.  Atries went over to the computer and pushed a button.  A disk drive opened which he placed the cd in.  He began typing rapidly and the tubes which Excalibur and Red Fang were in began to glow.  Then he stopped.  A button flashed on the control panel, he put his finger to it, closed his eyes and pushed the tears away, then pressed the button. <BR>	Death had Nova in both hands and was squeezing, he threw Nova into the air and shot a beam from his eyes into Nova.  Nova fell into the ground, seemingly out cold.  &#34;Nova get up!&#34; Sivart yelled at him.  One of Nova&#39;s eyes opened then the other.  He grit his teeth together and stood up, wiped the blood out of his fuzzy little hair by his mouth, and ran at Death.  Death jumped out of the way and came down with a large slap, knocking Nova into the ground.  Nova didn&#39;t get back up.   <BR>	Sutal walked forward toward Death.  &#34;I Sutal challenge you to battle.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Ha ha, a human would never stand a chance against any monster.  I accept your challenge.&#39;&#34; Death laughed a little more then started walking forward toward Sutal. <BR>	&#34;Wait, I ask that you allow me a short time to prepare for battle so that I may be more of a challenge.&#34;  Sutal walked over to his carriage.  He stepped up inside and pulled out a sword from the mythical Red Ruby Knight, the Red Ruby Knight was like a durahan, only dark red with wings on his helmet.  Then he reached in and grabbed what looked to be some kind of handle.  He pushed a button on it and a laser sword came from it.  Sutal smiled wickedly and walked over toward Death.  &#34;I&#39;m ready.&#34; <BR>	With that Death jumped at him full speed, Sutal jumped to the side then came down with the durahan sword into Death&#39;s side.  He then jabbed forward with the laser sword piercing Death&#39;s armor.  Death blocked the next hit that was coming above from the durahan sword and backhanded Sutal, sending him flying.  Sutal landed on his back then staggered back to his feet.  His face was covered in blood and it ran down onto his silk shirt, turning it red.  He pushed another button on the handle of the laser sword then immediately pushed another button, a drill shot out toward Death, Death jumped over it and landed on Sutal. <BR>	&#34;Stop you&#39;ll kill him!&#34;  Yeoj yelled at Death. <BR>	&#34;That&#39;s kind of the point.&#34;  Death smiled and then lifted his foot to crush what was left of Sutal. <BR>	There was a blast that hit Death from the side knocking him down.  He stood up and looked toward where it had come from.  Standing there was a henger, but it was gold in color with white hands and from the knee down it was white.  &#34;Death, I challenge you to a battle.&#34; <BR>	Atries and Elyk stood behind Death.  Atries was wearing his vision goggles.  &#34;Death is still stronger Atries, but he&#39;s also been wore down, I think we can win this!&#34; <BR>	&#34;We were so excited when he came to exist we forgot to give him a name.&#34; <BR>	The golden henger looked over, &#34;I will name myself and my name will be Entity.&#34; <BR>	&#34;I except your challenge Entity.&#34;  With that he kicked Sutal to the side, Atries ran and caught him, falling to the ground when Sutal landed in his arms. <BR>	Entity pointed his arm at Death and his fist shot out at him.  Death jumped over it in the direction of Entity.  Entity lifted his other arm up and it turned into a cannon, with that he shot a large beam surrounded in fire at Death. It exploded when it him and Death went flying.  Entity&#39;s fist retracted back into his arm.  Then a laser shot from his eye and hit Death in the chest knocking him down.  He struggled back to his feet.  &#34;Entity, I am weak from previous battles, therefore I must forfeit.  But until then,&#34; he turned to his army of monsters, &#34;attack!!  Then jumped over his army and about ten monsters followed him away from the battle. <BR>	Two golden wings came from the back of Entity.  He flew up into the air, on his back was something that acted like a jet-pack, and a huge beam surrounded in fire, one from each arm, down at the monsters.  It hit a coupled incinerating them instantly, then the force sent many others flying off.  It only took a small portion of their army out, but the rest ran in horror.  Entity landed and began picking them off one by one with small little beams, until they had all ran away or died. <BR>	They waited a couple minutes, until they were able to wake One-Eye up, and then teleported to the hospital. 	 <BR>	&#34;The only one we have to worry about is Sutal, the rest will be fine, you probably could just tell this by looking at him, but Hardcore is dead.&#34;  The doctor injected something into Nova&#39;s arm and then continued. &#34;What happened out there?&#34; <BR>	Elyk was the first to respond, &#34;You know there was a huge army, but that&#39;s not what gave us trouble.  A monster who has named himself Death fought each of our monsters and Sutal one on one.&#34; <BR>	&#34;The endbringer?&#34; <BR>	&#34;Not the henger sub-type joker Death, but a new Death, he seems to have all the memories of the old one though, and he is some type of monster I have never seen before.  He was horrendously strong.  We flew to the lab hoping for a miracle when we combined Red Fang and Excalibur and used this mysterious cd-rom that Excalibur had created.  It worked and we got a miracle, out came Entity,&#34; Elyk moved his hand toward Entity, &#34;Entity is the only monster besides Death who has stats that break the 999 mark.  Therefore he has potential to break the 5994 mark and become the strongest monster ever.  He fought Death and beat him, but he wouldn&#39;t have been able to if Death had been at full strength.  So we need to train him, so tell me how long is it going to be before Nova and One-Eye get out of the hospital because they will both be his training partners until the next battle where we will have to fight Death.&#34; <BR>	&#34;That&#39;s amazing, two monsters have managed to break the 999 max in one stat areas and one has even broke the 5994 mark for total.  Nova and One-Eye will be out probably tomorrow, but they won&#39;t be able to train for another week or so.&#34;  The doctor was still dwelling on the stat max break. <BR>	&#34;I have an idea.&#34;  Yeoj spoke up from behind them.  &#34;We&#39;ll have the top ten trainers in the world meet at Elyk&#39;s house and we can all train together, we&#39;ll send the notice out today and most of them should probably be there by tomorrow.  It shouldn&#39;t take that long to get to your house from where they live because most of them live close to the battle arena and your house isn&#39;t all that far from there either, then we&#39;ll all train together.&#34; <BR>	Atries walked over to a phone in the doctor&#39;s office and picked it up, &#34;Get me the committee.  Yes, this Atries, the monster Hardcore is dead, he was killed in the battle, the monster Red Fang and my monster Excalibur are also gone.  Death is still the leader of the army, he has been reincarnated into some kind of super strong monster, we need you to contact the top ten monsters and their trainers and tell them to go to Elyk&#39;s ranch for training, yes I have Elyk&#39;s permission, the training is for the upcoming battle against Death.  Yes thank you, goodbye.&#34;  He hung up the phone and turned to Elyk, &#34;They said that all the trainers will be there withing two days. <BR>				January 22nd, 1064 <BR>	You are all here to train for the battle that will take place very soon.&#34;  Atries yelled at them all.  &#34;My monster had to be sacrificed as did the monsters of many others in order to win the last one, and this is the least you can do.  You are the top ten trainers in the world, as I read off your name tell me who you are and what your monster is, Elyk will give me the power reading on the monsters.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Rank #10 Jared.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Right here, my monster is a niton named Shelley.&#34;  He had an average male voice and sounded kind of nervous. <BR>	&#34;Strength Level is 3000, highest stat is defense at 800.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Rank # 9 Max.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Here, my monster is a golem named Rocky.&#34;  Max was a big man that had a build similar to his golem. <BR>	&#34;Strength level is 3003, highest stat is Power at 999.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Rank #8 Jim.&#34; <BR>	&#34;My monster is a Jill. &#40;A monster that looks kind of like Big foot with white hair&#41; His name is Big guy.&#34;  Jim was an old man who looked like he had been working his entire life. <BR>	&#34;Strength level is 3310, strongest stat is life at 600.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Rank #7 Yeoj.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Right here, my monster is a suezo named One-Eye, he can&#39;t train for the rest of the week though because he was injured during the last battle.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Strength level is 3900.  Highest stat is skill at 999.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Rank #6 Flank.&#34; <BR>	&#34;My monster is a durahan named Arthur.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Strength level is 3760.  Highest stat is defense which is 990&#34; <BR>	&#34;Rank #5, Michelle.&#34;   <BR>	&#34;My monster is an angel &#40;pixie that had white on instead of pink&#41; named Angel.&#34;  She had a real high pitched voice. <BR>	&#34;Strength level is 4001.  Highest stat is speed at 800.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Rank #4, Michael.&#34; <BR>	&#34;My monster is a phoenix named Inferno.&#34;  Michael was a young boy of about 15, for being so young he was ranked extremely high in world, probably the youngest trainer to ever make it in the top ten.  He had blonde hair and deep blue eyes. <BR>	&#34;Strength level is 4200, highest stat is intelligence at 900.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Rank #3, Jack.&#34; <BR>	&#34;My monster is a dracohopper, a hopper sub-type dragon, his name is Happy.&#34;  There was a slight chuckle among the other trainers, then most stopped in realization that Happy&#39; was rank 3 in the world and could beat them in battle. <BR>	&#34;Strength level is 4199, strongest stat is skill at 999.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Rank #2, Lilly.&#34; <BR>	&#34;My monster is a siren &#40;an undine sub-type joker, undines were mermaid creatures that were made of water, the sub-type joker made it a dark purple in some places making it look as though it had clothing on&#41; and her name is Destroyer.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Strength level is 5000, strongest stats are intelligence and speed at 999.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Rank #1, Sivart.&#34; <BR>	&#34;My monster is a pulsar named Nova.  He will not be able to train for the rest of the week because he was badly injured in the last battle.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Strength level is 4508, highest stats are speed and power at 999.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Okay we&#39;re going to train in groups, of three,   Shelley, Rocky and Big Guy will be one group, the next will be Arthur, Angel and Inferno, the last will be Happy, Destroyer and this monster who&#39;s name is Entity.&#34;  Atries gestured toward the monster&#39;s living quarters and out walked Entity, a type of monster that no one had ever seen before. <BR>	Big Guy and Rocky locked hands and began pushing against each other, Rocky overpowering, Shelley began whipping them from afar with his tentacles.  Angel and Inferno flew high in the air and Inferno shot a larger beam toward Angel, Angel yelled, &#34;Megaray!!&#34; and fired multiple smaller beams in return, they collided and energy began gathering between the two.  Arthur shot a blast of air into the energy forming in the center and it exploded, knocking the Inferno and Angel to the ground.  Arthur charged at Angel and began slashing at her with his sword, she blocked each attack with her arm, each one left a small cut.   <BR>	Happy rapid punched at Entity who dodged in between each attack and then kicked the little monster sending it flying.  It caught itself with it&#39;s little wings on its back and floated its red scaly body back down to the earth. A beam came from the side and froze Happy solid.  Destroyer turned to Entity and shot the same beam, Entity lifted his arm and met it with a medium sized beam of his own, hers was stronger and began overpowering Entity&#39;s attack.  Entity made a larger beam and began overpowering her attack.  They were both hit in the side of the head with little red fists and turned to see Happy standing there retracting his stretchable arms. <BR>	Inside Elyk&#39;s house the trainers sat and read different books on different training methods and how to make a monster stronger.  Nova and One Eye read in books about different techniques they could acquire.  They also concentrated on making objects float in midair thereby increasing their knowledge and intelligence.

 Final Part <BR> <BR>				February 29th, 1064 <BR>	The monster had been training hard for a month and after One-Eye and Nova had healed they joined into two groups themselves.  Nova with Destroyer, Happy, and Entity, and One-Eye with Shelley, Rocky and Big Guy.  Elyk and Atries were in the weight room, Elyk strained to lift 250 pounds for his tenth time, finally got it and then set it back down.  Atries added another 200 pounds and began benching it, first he took it down to his chest then slowly lifted it up, then he did it again and continued.  The gym was hit with a large explosion taking out one of the walls.  The trainers got up and went outside to where the monsters were training.  Standing in the distance about 300 yards away was Death and a large army of about 300 monsters. <BR>	&#34;Monsters come to me!!&#34;  Atries yelled and the monsters gathered in front of him.  The trainers stood behind him.  He looked over at Yeoj, &#34;Go get the taffy and the nuts oil, we can&#39;t have our monsters fight when they&#39;re tired.&#34;  Yeoj ran into the house.  &#34;This is what you all have been preparing for, this battle will be tough, we are far outnumbered and we.....&#34;  He was cut off by a carriage pulled by two Baku came driving up. <BR>	Out of the carriage stepped Sutal.  Out from behind him came a centaur in white armor from head to toe.  &#34;We are here to help.&#34; Sutal spoke in his normal emotionless voice.  &#34;I think you will find my monster of sufficient power to aid you, he trained with Hardcore for the last half of Hardcore&#39;s life and is pretty strong for his age.  I call him Crusader.&#34; <BR>	Elyk ran into the gym and came out with his vision goggles, &#34;Strength level is 3500.  He will be very useful, he has also learned all his techniques.&#34; <BR>	A durahan made of stone, probably sub-type golem, from Death&#39;s side walked toward their side of the soon to be battlefield.  &#34;Big Guy go find out what he wants.&#34;  Atries yelled, Big Guy grunted and him and Jim walked toward the durahan.  Within a couple of minutes Big Guy and the durahan were standing within in ten feet of each other.  The durahan yelled out to them, &#34;Death offers you the chance to surrender, the humans death will be painless and the monsters will join our army.&#34; <BR>	&#34;No chance in hell.&#34;  Jim spoke solidly and the monster almost seemed intimidating.   <BR>	&#34;Then I am to kill you and your monster.&#34;  The durahan raised his sword up into a fighting position.  &#34;I am Death&#39;s 3rd strongest monster, one of his generals, Death and his rank three will kill you.&#34;  The durahan ran forward at Big Guy.	 <BR>	Big Guy grabbed hold of the durahan and picked him up with one hand and slammed him into the ground.  The Durahan slashed at Big Guy and hit him across the chest.  Big Guy stumbled back in pain, a large slice was down his chest.  &#34;I am Warrior, and I will be your death.&#34;  The durahan then jumped into the air and pointed his sword straight down toward Big Guy.  Big Guy closed his eyes and lifted his hands into the air, a tornado swept Warrior into the air and spun him around, he was hit by lightning and large balls of rock hard ice, then dropped to the ground.  Warrior got up and slashed at Big Guy and hit him across the chest then continued spinning and hitting in a flurry of blades.  Big Guy stumbled back and roared, then ran forward spinning his arms as fast as he could and began hitting Warrior over and over, knocking the sword from Warrior&#39;s hands.  Warrior kicked Big Guy in the stomach then did a roundhouse sending Big Guy flying.  Warrior turned around to grab his sword and found there, Jim, who bashed Warrior&#39;s head in with the sword.  Warrior swung his fist at Jim and knocked hit to the ground.  Big Guy grabbed Warrior from behind and began squeezing as hard as he could.  The air around them froze and a large icicle, larger than a house, and ending in a needle like point, formed above them.  It fell crashing and shattering as it crushed Warrior, killing him.  Big Guy and Jim walked back toward the other monsters and their trainers.   <BR>	&#34;Are you okay?&#34;  Elyk came running up.   <BR>	&#34;Big Guy is hurt bad, we have to get him to bed to rest.  I&#39;m afraid he won&#39;t be able to participate in this battle.  That was Death&#39;s third strongest warrior so I&#39;m glad we could at least help out some.&#34;  Jim was under Big Guy&#39;s arm and struggling to hold him up.  Elyk and Jim helped Big Guy into the monster&#39;s house, laid him down in a bed made specially for larger monsters.  They wrapped his wounds in bandages and went outside with the rest of the trainers and monsters.   <BR>	&#34;It seems there two other really strong monsters out there, as strong and stronger than some of us.  They are Death&#39;s Elite.  Besides them don&#39;t forget about Death, do not go one on one with him, you will die.  If you find him try to either runaway or find another monster to help you fight him.  Try to take out as many monsters as possible while wasting as little energy as possible.  Try to do it from afar so there is less chance of you getting hit by an attack.  Well, hope you&#39;re all ready to fight because here we go!&#34;  Elyk pointed at the army of monsters running their way. <BR>	They turned and began marching toward the army of monsters.  They had the advantage that they were stronger than any of the monsters they would be fighting, but they were severely outnumbered.  Destroyer began shooting ice beams and freezing monsters solid from far away.  The monsters would freeze, fall over, and shatter.  Inferno flew ahead of the other monsters and put his wings into the air, a large wall of fire came from behind him and splashed down on the battle field melting many monsters down to nothing.  Happy stretched his arms out and hit monsters from afar knocking them down and out.  One Eye shot telepathic waves and knocked monsters into the air, them shaking from the power, and collapsing on the ground when they landed, mentally gone.  Entity shot little blasts from his arm and incinerated little monsters from afar.  The monster army had finally reached the group and began overwhelming them. <BR>	Rocky, separated into pieces and began spinning violently, the monsters were caught up and spun around being hit by large boulders and being crushed like they were nothing.  He went back together and curled into a little ball and began rolling, mowing down any monster in his way.  He hit a monster and sent him flying back.  He uncurled and looked up, standing in front of him was Death.  Death laughed, raised his hands into the air and energy gathered in them, he put his arms in front of them and shot two energy blasts from his hands incinerating Rocky into nothing. <BR>	Nova jumped over an attack and hit the monster from behind, then turned and kicked another monster in the head.  He head butted a monster in front of him and then punched to both sides knocking out two more monsters.  He then gave a hard straight in front of him and blinded a suezo.  He jumped toward a celius &#40;a centaur that was sub-type tiger, had the body of a centaur but was blue and white everywhere like a tiger and had a head like a tiger&#41; and gave a hard kick.  The celius jumped out of the way.  Suddenly no monsters were attacking Nova.   <BR>	&#34;I am Blaze.  Death&#39;s strongest warrior.  Prepare to be destroyed.&#34;  With that Blaze jumped into the air and a large red rock on fire formed in his hand, with both hands he pushed it down in front of him and then plummeted toward Nova.  Nova jumped out of the way, the ground imploded and all that was left was a large black hole.  Blaze charged toward Nova and shot a fire ball while he was running toward Nova.  Nova caught it in his little mitten like hands and pushed against the fireball and then pulled one arm back and punched it, sending it flying through the air.  Blaze was about 5 feet away now and began jabbing at Nova with his long spear.  Nova jumped back and forth in between the attacks until one came straight toward his head.  Nova&#39;s hands came together in front of him catching the spear about one-inch from his face.  Nova used it for leverage and spun around while holding the spear and roundhouse kicked Blaze in the head.  Blaze caught Nova by the ears and brought Nova up to be looking him straight in the eyes.  Nova punched Blaze across the face knocking him to the ground.  Nova ran forward and pulled his arm back as hard as he could and came forward hitting Blaze and creating a big bang sound.  Blaze stumbled back, grabbed his stomach, and his two front legs fell to their knees.    Blaze looked up at Nova and raised his spear above his head.  He began spinning it around and then brought it down below his arm and it ended pointing at Nova.  A large blast of energy came rushing forward toward Nova.  Nova tried to jump over it, but was to late and it burned his feet.  Nova fell to the ground and struggled to his feet. His legs were in a severe amount of pain.  He looked Blaze deep in the eyes and then ran forward and gave the strongest kick he could ever give, his foot went through Blaze and Blaze fell into two pieces.  Nova turned his back toward the dead blaze and a little bit of green gas escaped from just below his little flap of a tail. <BR>	A zilla picked up Destroyer from behind and began squeezing.  &#34;Know that you were killed by one of the best.&#34;  It said in a deep voice. <BR>	&#34;Know that you weren&#39;t one of the best.&#34;  With that she slipped out of his hands by turning to pure liquid, then reformed, turned to look at the zilla and then shot a large beam at him.  He was hit then surrounded by an outline of a coffin in ice, the coffin imploded on him then exploded in icy blue energy.   <BR>	The zilla stumbled forward and started, &#34;But I&#39;m rank # 2, I can&#39;t....&#34;  With that he was hit with two of the blasts that he was previously hit with and collapsed on the ground.  He then struggled back to his feet squinting his eyes in pain, Destroyer floated forward, her arm turned into and ice sword and she slashed the zilla across the place where there would be a neck if he had one.  He collapsed on the ground not moving this time. <BR>	The battle continued for hours, until all the monsters were dead or knocked out.  The humans were all also out cold.  Two monsters remained, Death and Entity.  Death chuckled, &#34;You again, I&#39;m at full power this time, you can&#39;t win.&#34; <BR>	&#34;Wrong.&#34;  Entity raised both his arms up and shot two large blasts out of his arms, Death put both hands out to stop them, but they were to strong and his arms collapsed under the power and he was hit.   <BR>	He got back up to his feet and growled.  &#34;How about we see what you&#39;ve got, bring it.&#34;  He gestured with his hand toward himself. <BR>	Entity ran forward toward Death and punched.  Death caught the attack and came with a large slap from the side.  Entity ducked under it and jumped into the air, a sword of white energy formed in his hands and he began flipping and came down on top of Death, hitting him with the sword over and over.  Death stumbled back in pain.  Then shot an energy blast at Entity.  Entity tried to catch it but it exploded on contact and sent him flying back.  He shot small blasts from his right arm at Death.  Death backhanded one blast away, then another, then was hit in the chest with a big one, knocking him to the ground.  He formed some energy above his head and threw a large fireball at Entity.  Entity had a sword come from each wrist which he crossed in front of him, he blocked the fireball with them and held it for a second before uncrossing them and sending the fireball back at Death, Death caught it with his hands and raised it above his head and sent it flying back.  Entity shot multiple beams from his eye into the fireball, it exploded sending them both flying.  Entity spread his wings out and with the jet flew high into the air and began charging a cannon on one arm.  Death stood up and two dark pink wings sprouted from his back, which he began to flap and they lifted him off he ground.  He flew toward Entity full speed.  Entity fired his cannon and it was a huge laser blast that tore into Death and knocked him to the ground.  Entity flew toward the falling Death and began punching him again and again and then finished with a kick to Death&#39;s head that sent him flying into the ground.  He flew toward Death laser swords at his sides to finish Death off, Death laid on the ground not moving. <BR>	Right before his swords pierced Death&#39;s skin, Death caught him with his large arms and began to squeeze Entity.  &#34;Finally, I have one.  Let me show you my true power.&#34;  Death had Entity&#39;s arms pinned to his sides and he could not lift his legs up far to hit Death&#39;s arms, and they were not long enough to kick him.  Death began to glow and smiled with his sharp white shiny teeth.  Then a spear came through his chest.  It was pulled out a second afterward.  Death fell to the ground, dead.  Behind him stood Crusader, battered and bruised, but still strong enough to finish business. <BR>					March 30th, 1064 <BR> <BR>	&#34;This tournament we have the top ten monsters competing for new ranks.  It is expected that Destroyer take the #1 position this time.  There will also be some changing down below.  There will also be an unveiling of the new monster that the trainers Elyk and Atries will be training.  It is rumored to be some type of henger.  Now the tournament will begin!&#34;  The announcer yelled and the crowd cheered.  <BR>	&#34;Battle #1, Nova versus One Eye.&#34;  Nova walked out to the center of the arena.  One Eye hopped out there on his tail.  &#34;Let the battle begin!!&#34;  Nova got in a fighting stance and One Eye gritted his teeth. <BR>	Nova ran full speed at One Eye and punched as hard as he could, One Eye disappeared and reappeared behind Nova and then started slapping Nova with his tongue.  Nova ducked to the ground then rolled over and jumped to his feet.  One Eye disappeared and reappeared above Nova and came down on top of him with his tail, Nova caught the tail, turned, and slammed One Eye into the ground.  Then he kicked One Eye into an arena wall.  One Eye got up and shot a laser from his eye at Nova, Nova punched it to the side sending it into another wall.  Nova walked forward slowly staring One Eye down.  One Eye growled and a small vein in his forehead began to stick out.  Then in a second One Eye grew to the size of a house and bent down to try to bite Nova, Nova dodged to the side, but One Eye did not shrink down he went for another bite, and he hit.  Nova was squished between the teeth and One Eye began to chew, Nova becoming greatly injured.  Nova caught himself and put his feet on One Eye&#39;s bottom teeth and his hands on One Eye upper teeth, One Eye struggled but could not close his mouth.  With that Nova let a large amount of gas flow from below his fluffy tell, One Eye spit Nova out, shrunk back down to normal size and collapsed. <BR>	&#34;The winner of this battle is Nova!&#34;  The announcer yelled and everyone cheered. <BR>	Throughout the rest of the battles it continued with Nova wins! and Destroyer wins, until the last battle, where the two finally met to battle for the world championship.  &#34;This battle will be between the two strongest monsters on the planet.  Nova and Destroyer!&#34;  They both went into the arena and got into a fighting stance.  &#34;Let the battle begin!&#34;  With that the two went toward each other full speed.  Nova jumped out of the way of Destroyer and came up from behind her.  He began rapidly hitting her in the back.  She turned and was hit by a strong attack right to the head.  Nova didn&#39;t let down and began punching her in the stomach, then gave her an uppercut and kicked her in the stomach.  Her hand turned into and ice sword and came down on top of Nova, Nova caught it and broke it off.  She screamed in horror and jumped back out of pain&#39;s way.  Nova ran toward her and jumped into the air and kicked her in the head, landed and continued to kick her in the face, back and forth across it.  She floated into the air and shot down an ice beam at Nova, Nova was hit and it shaped around in him in the form of a coffin, he let a big one escape from underneath his fluffy tail and all the ice melted.  Destroyer was worried and began charging in both hands, blue energy rose from her.  Nova began glowing and one hand began to electrify and sparks flew about it.  She shot her blasts at him and he jumped toward her.  He broke through both blasts with the electrified fist and then hit her in the stomach.  She fell to the ground and didn&#39;t move.  &#34;The winner is..... Nova!!&#34;  Nova jumped up and down and held his boxing glove shaped hands above his head. <BR>	&#34;Now what we&#39;ve all been waiting for.  The unveiling of the new monster to be trained by two of the greatest trainers of all time.  Meet..... Entity!&#34;  A sheet was taken off of the golden henger&#39;s head.  &#34;His strength level at about 2 months old is rumored to be stronger than any monster ever!  I will bring up his stats on the teletron right now, they are as follows,&#34; A screen on came out of the ground from the middle of the arena and on it some numbers came up. &#34;Oh my god, he&#39;s incredibly strong, life is 999, power is 1000, intelligence is 1000, skill is 1200, speed is 1051 and defense is 1207.  The strongest monster ever recorded, Hardcore, didn&#39;t even have his stats at straight max, and now it&#39;s been found that it wasn&#39;t even the max.  That was the thought to be the highest physically possible for any monster to get.  But that theory has now been disapproved. Thank you everyone and goodnight!&#34;

 Dude! Most new aurthors have a length flaw when they begin, sometimes they want to know if their work is any good before theyr ight a lot. Naturally, we encourage them to write longer stories to help them develope their talents. Others are experianced writers. Yours, I can&#39;t express that you don&#39;t require any more length in mere words. I got halfway through this today, and I&#39;ll try to read the rest tomorrow, I&#39;m pressed for time today. All in all, I like it!
