 Hey everyone!  Sorry about the long wait...  Life seems to have well...  become some thing I have to pay more attention to.  SO, I dont have as much time as I once did to sort my thoughts out and write stuff.  Anyhow, Enjoy. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>That night, after a small celebration of our victory, we were allowed again to stay in the village.  Durahan, after a long soak in a small hot spring, seemed to be only bruised by the battle.  After getting cleaned up, his steps were sure again, if a little weary.  But despite his obvious lack of energy, he still denied that he was tired.  Sarah&#39;s ankle was also only a minor hurt, and caused her only a slight limp after she too took a bath in the hot spring near town.  All in all, we did well for our very first &#39;serious&#39; fight.  But one thing worried me. <BR> <BR>Angel.  She had not suffered any physical harm.  But I could see...  Pain, a torment of the soul.  Some thing was bothering her in a way most humans never experience.  She looked away from me when I looked at her with the question on the tip of my tongue.  Sarah, too, couldn&#39;t get any answers either. <BR> <BR>Some thing was wrong.  This entire situation stunk of something, and Angel knew what it was.  I could feel it.  But, I wouldn&#39;t get an answer from her.  So, I looked elsewhere for the answer.  I looked in the book.  Some how, I felt the answer was in there, between the hard covers of that old tome. <BR> <BR>I was right, and as I read, I could feel my own soul cry out for Angel.  My own pain seemed like a spark against an inferno.  I found, after the pages containing the near end of the ancient&#39;s civilization, where the Shrine Keepers had become monster hunters.  Experimenting with humans, in a desperate attempt to regain ground lost to the monster armies, some hunters had undergone a monster merging.  Instead of the two pedestals, a third was added.  Two monsters, and a human, merged into a single form.  Again I saw the madness that war brings.  Sealing the monsters in disks was good.  Having to hunt down rouge monsters...  Not really pleasant, but even in this age, it had to be done on occasion. <BR> <BR>But this?  Madness!  Creating something that could just as easily fail, and cause more damage.  We had already seen what just one of these...  Hybrids, could do.  My mind boggled at the thought of a small army of them.  Reading further, past a detailed example of the process of how the merging was done, it confirmed my thoughts on the matter.  Yes, the process wasn&#39;t always successful.  Some times, a man-monster would go die before even taking a step off the pedestal, or even, as with the Dean, go insane, the difference in mentality distorting the person&#39;s mind. <BR> <BR>Some of these experiments had worked, with great success.  People gaining a Pixie&#39;s magic, or dragon wings, or a golem&#39;s great strength.  But it was still, not enough.  There was more too.  The experiments were continued, in a frantic effort to save what was left of their civilization.  But, that is where the book ended.  The last words, reading as such, &#34;Despite the mediocre results of the man-monster experiments, positive data was obtained.  There is a possibility of creating a monster, artificial like the Hengar, but still organic.  Our only hope is that this effort works, and soon, as they&#39;re few places left that have not fallen to the monster armies.&#34; <BR> <BR>That was it.  Answers, leading to questions, with only one certainty.  What ever it was the ancients had in mind as this &#39;last resort&#39;, it had failed.  The evidence was all over the world, right? <BR> <BR>I closed the book, looking over to the nearly burned out candle.  Durahan was resting, sitting in the way of the door.  Sarah was in the single bedroom in the cabin the villagers provided for us after the celebration.  And Angel...  When I looked away from the candle, was standing quietly beside the desk, just outside of the candle&#39;s small glow.  I could see tears in her eyes. <BR> <BR>&#39;You know.&#39;  I said to her, not asked. <BR> <BR>She nodded, looking away from me.  &#39;You know, and you are ashamed...  Why?&#39;  She wouldn&#39;t answer me.  I knew she wouldn&#39;t, but the question seemed to burn in my mind the longer I held it in.  &#39;Some thing my father discovered along with you, makes you ashamed.  What?  What is this secret?  What secret could be so dark that...&#39; <BR> <BR>A sudden vision from the cave, the morning after Angel and I fled from the ranch, the angry shout that died on my lips...  But not this time...  Tears filled my eyes as well. <BR> <BR>&#39;What secret is so dark that my father had to die to keep you safe from it?!?!&#39;  I yelled at her through my own tears.  &#39;What secret could make you cry...?&#39; <BR> <BR>Angel was holding me then, I could feel her arms wrapped around me, comforting me as my mother had when things troubled me.  I wanted to push her away until I had an answer from her, to get some sort of...  Clue to this whole mess.  But I couldn&#39;t ask.  The anger I felt, so sharply pointed at Angel, slid away, shattering like a glass window and vanishing like puff of smoke. <BR> <BR>After finding my voice again, the tears burned out of me again, I remember speaking before I fell asleep, &#39;I will uncover this secret.  My father&#39;s last wish, your sorrow, and my vengeance, I will find out what this is all about.&#39; <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Again, I pause my writing.  The morning sun becoming painful in its mid dawn brilliance, shining through the window of the small cabin we all rested in.  I could feel the chewy brown root lose its potency, my eyes starting to blur as weariness crept up on me.  Still more to write, but by the gods I was sleepy. <BR> <BR>Lightly blowing on the freshly inked page, I shook out my hand.  I could hear a faint wind blowing outside, the slight sigh of its passing almost like a lullaby in my current state. <BR> <BR>I will write more tomorrow...  Yes, after some rest... <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>I also appologize for the short length of the update.  The story is sort of at...  a crossroad again.  Heres one, I&#39;ll leave it to you readers &#40;if I have any left&#41; to help me decide. <BR> <BR>I was thinking of setting Miki&#39;s &#40;the &#39;hero&#39;s&#41; prolog aside, and switching points of view until I reached the next major event.  But, I&#39;m not sure if I should, or should not.  So, I&#39;ll put it to a bit of a vote. <BR> <BR>Keep Miki&#39;s viewpoint <BR> <BR>or <BR> <BR>Switch for a while.

 I love this story. I like the POV as is, however I&#39;m sure you could pull off switching to someone else. As long as more comes I&#39;m happy. =&#41;

 here is a long answer that will not help, but hopefully will give you something to think about. <BR> <BR>a lot of my time is spent on monster rancher, and tecmo, boards.  what i see too often is fans taking ownership interest in the sequel to the game - in what is to come - and then becoming angry and turning aside from the game they enjoyed, because their suggestions do not become reality.  yet they became fans of the game - ardent enough fans to become regulars on forums associated with that game - precisely because the game contained a spark of inspiration and ingenuity that reached them and touched them and caused them to celebrate the creativity involved with the original game&#39;s creation. <BR> <BR>i am now a fan of your story.  the last thing that i want to do is take an ownership interest in it, only to become disappointed when it goes in another direction.  however you want to spin out the tale - even if you tally up the votes of others and proceed accordingly - is fine with me.  you, the storyteller, have earned my faith in your storytelling. <BR> <BR>as you can already tell, i abstain.

 &#42;ponders on this.&#42;  &#42;reads it over&#42;  &#42;ponders a little more&#42; <BR> <BR>Yes.  There are times when giving advice starts to get your hopes up.  Kinda like voting for sombody in parlement, who gets elected, and then becomes a total twit. <BR> <BR>So the vote sits <BR>One: stay the same <BR>none: change POV <BR>one: sitting back and watching. <BR> <BR>^_^

 I think that another point of view would be okay, but I do rather enjoy Miki&#39;s prologue. But, as torey luvullo stated, it is not my story &#40;which, by the way, will be coming very soon&#41;. The Blaize saga, my story, is mostly all told from a third person view. But, then again, it is your masterpiece and your choice. Even if you tally the votes of my fellow readers, it is still your choice. So I am going to have to say, tack up another for sitting back and watching.

 dragon master makes a good point.  miki&#39;s prologue is such a nice set up to the whole story.  so, if you are going to change pov&#39;s, i would hope you would provide some sort of reason why suddenly the tale is not being told as miki is writing it down.

 Hmm.  Well, as I stated before, the story itself is still going to progress as planned.  It has a sort of...  Definate, path.  I know I could pull off the switch fairly easily, but, it seems that Miki has a fanbase now.  &#40;snicker&#41; <BR> <BR>Alright.  I&#39;ll get back to my writing desk, so to speak.  Thanks for the input everyone.  ^_^
