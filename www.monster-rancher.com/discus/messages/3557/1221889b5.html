 The fire came closer towards Gali’s group as it was suddenly stopped. A Tiger with a bit of Plant mixed into it was huffing and puffing as soon as the smoke cleared up. Lightning surged through his body. Sean and other monsters ran towards Gali and his group as the Tiger stared down the Dragon. The Tiger was very bulky with his muscles easily showing through his body. Lightning waved through his body as the Dragon had finally realized that his attack was blocked. That was the first time it had happened to him, he became furious and exploded downwards at the Tiger.  <BR> <BR>The Tiger easily dodged, speed and power seemed to be his strength as he dashed towards the dragon. His horns on his head lead the way as he came closer to the death dragon. He was a few feet in front of the dragon when he was dodged. The dragon fluttered his wings and the Tiger was caught in a huge dust tornado along with trees.  <BR> <BR>Sean watched this fight as the Golem kept a close watch on him. Sean remembered the Golem mentioning that the Tiger was one of the strongest monsters in the world. He was a big contender in international battles and never lost. He was finally squaring off against someone who could actually beat him. The Tiger had become emotionally stronger after his trainer was brutally murdered. He had lots of hatred towards Caesar and his gang of monsters and wanted no more than to kill them all.   <BR> <BR>The Dragon flew into his ‘hand- made’ tornado and claws clashing and loud noises were heard and lightning and fire was seen coming from the tornado. A scream from the tornado echoed through the forest as a large ice storm shot out of the tornado. The tornado died down and threw the Tiger out. He hit the ground spinning and struggled to get to his feet as he looked on. Snow and ice covered the ground where the tornado once was.  <BR> <BR>Sean walked over to the Tiger to aide him, but was held back by the Golem. He told him that the fight wasn’t over and that it wouldn’t be wise to leave his sight. Sean then noticed two gashes running down the side of the Tiger, but thanks to the Plant side of him the gash was slowly healing itself as he caught his breath. He took a few steps as the snow began to melt away as the dragon stood up and let out a scream. He flapped his wings effortlessly and flew up into the air and recklessly charged downwards. He had no specific target, just anything in his way. The Tiger was wounded badly and couldn’t move to do much as he watched the dragon rip through monsters in his group. A hare tried to attack the dragon, but was beheaded before it could do anything. The dragon shot a stream of fire that instantly killed 3 monsters.  <BR>  <BR>Vines came from the Tigers wound and healed the dog quickly. The dragon had been halted when he was punched by the Golem guarding Sean. He ordered Sean to run as he held him off. Seconds later the dragon ripped through the body of the Golem and continued his assault. The Tropical Dog was healed and charged into the side of the dragon, his horns couldn’t break the outer layer of bone on the dragon. He let out an electrical bolt run through the body of the dragon as the bone structure began to shake and his eyes rolled in the back of his head. The dragon fought to gain back control as convulsions ran through out his body. He screamed as he flapped his wings out creating a gigantic tornado.  <BR> <BR>Sean was on the back of a hare as he ran off with him. They were out of the tornado’s path, but it caught the Tiger and everyone else and whipped them around. A few monsters in Gali’s party died as the tornado spun more rapidly. The tiger exploded out of it and clashed with the dragon in mid- air. The Tropical Dog snarled as he clawed at the dragon. The dragon slashed his claws and tried to attack the dog as they fell to the ground.   <BR> <BR>Gali slowly regained consciousness and with all his might he stopped the tornado as monsters fell dazed to the ground. He lowered himself to the ground and watched the Tropical Dog fend off the Dragon. He could tell both were tired to the point it’d be easy to finish off the Dragon. Gali pondered the idea as he watched the two powerhouses clash. Gali charged up a bolt of lightning at his finger tips and then the dog screamed.  <BR> <BR>“He’s mine! Don’t you help!”  <BR> <BR>Gali stopped and watched the fight. The Tiger took great pride in him self and had to kill him for his own reasons. Neither would easily be defeated and Gali knew this could go on for hours… or even days. Gali tried to gather some energy to destroy the dragon, much to the Tropical Dog’s disappointment. He didn’t seem to have enough energy for something that would do anything but anger the dragon. The dog dashed in and got a grip of the rotten flesh of the dragon and began tearing it off the bone. The dragon was getting ready to whip his wings out to do his massive flutter attack, but the dog took advantage of this moment and charged into his right wing, nearly cracking the bone. His left wing flapped with half the energy, but still had power to knock over a few trees that were in the way. The other wing was frozen as the Tiger continued to try to advance through the wing of the dragon. The Death Dragon whipped his head around and got his head around and got a hold of the dogs back.  <BR> <BR>The Tropical Dog yelped as he was lifted off of the dragon’s wing. Then to the horror of the comrades of the Tiger, the dragon slowly began chewing on him. He was going to eat him, Gali thought. A blast of fire struck the dragon and knocked the Tiger out of his mouth. The plant genes in the dog weren’t going to bring him back to good enough health to fight effectively. Gali launched his Napalm once more as rotting flesh was burned. The smell became so horribly rancid that it caused Sean to vomit. The dragon seemed to have no end to his life as he was attacked again and again by weak Napalms that only got weaker. The Tiger stood to his feet as sweat fell from his forehead he scowled at the beast and tensed his body as energy seemed to ascend from his body. The pupils of the dragon faded away as the energy coming for the dog seemed to thicken.  <BR> <BR>Then with all of the might he had left an explosion came from the Tigers mouth. The sound waves could be seen travel as it hit the dragon. The extreme loudness of the sound caused Sean’s ears to begin to bleed as he fell to his knees screaming. He cupped his ears and let out a scream that couldn’t be heard by anyone near the scene. The blow caused everyone to lose their hearing for a short time. In all the ruckus they didn’t see what happened to the dragon. Gali looked over and saw a pile of dismantled bones, and rotting flesh seep to the ground. The Tiger began to shake and then fell to the ground, passed out.

-Just got done reading all the others, so I&#39;m sorry I got here a little late- <BR> <BR>Very very good! You have a way with writing... just... it&#39;s just so vivid. It&#39;s like I can see exactly what you see in your mind while writing, beyond the point of actual &#39;seeing&#39; to the point of <I>feeling</I> the action. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">However</FONT> <BR> <BR>I know this is a bloody story, with each monster showing contempt toward another, but you should not emphasize so much of your descriptive ability on how things looked. You could shoot for how each character with a &#40;major&#41; event felt, or even if they portrayed a certain emotion. <BR> <BR>Overall, an awesome epic so far! <BR> <BR><B>RANK:</B> <FONT COLOR="ff0000">A</FONT>
