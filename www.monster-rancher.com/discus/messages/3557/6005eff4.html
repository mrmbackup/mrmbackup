<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF='mailto:Richard@absalom.co.uk'>GARLANT</A></B> on <B>Saturday, October 27, 2001 - 11:49 am</B>:</FONT><P>
 The travellers had reached a crossroads.  They had defeated the monks for now and got much stronger.  The need to stick together was now gone.  Kain sat on the floor eating a chicken leg.  The others were all silent.  Even the monsters eating had fallen into a quiet growl.  Mia and Alex were going to leave.  They wanted to take the separate path.  Kain and Zack had tried to talk them out of it.  Mia explained that noth of them felt that the males did not think they were as strong.  Kain knew that they were all equal but could see how the girls could feel this way.  When the lunch was finished they all stood up and smiled slightly.  The girls took the left road and Kain and Zack stood waving for minutes on end.  Then Zack stopped and turned.  He faced the right road. <BR>  &#34;They are gonna be fine.&#34;  Said Zack some how reading Kain&#39;s mind.  Bolt and Houndine looked sadly at each other and they followed their masters down the right path.  It was a long walk with the other two gone.  There were large gaps in the conversation.  Zack battled another trainer later that day.  The trainer was called George and had a Jelly gaboo called Globula.  The two monsters stood a distance away and watched each other as George said, <BR>  &#34;Ready, steady, go!&#34;   <BR>  Globula pushed out two long arms from its main body.  They dug into the ground and pushed it straight up.  The jelly blob fell right towards Houndine.  Houndine dived forward and turned firing a spray of ice from its mouth.  Globula screamed as its face began to freeze over.  Its beady black eyes closed and its arms went limp.  George stared in amazement. <BR>  &#34;Wow, your tiger is really strong.&#34;  Said George in awe.  He walked over to Globula and tried to brush some of the ice off.  Globula groaned gently and looked unhappy.  His eyes were not as dark as they had been earlier that day.  George shook Zack&#39;s hand then carried the Gaboo off to the east.  Zack chucked a lump of meat at Houndine who jumped up and caught it in his teeth. He dropped it to the ground and began to pull chunks off with his teeth.  Zack walked over to Kain who was training Bolt.  Bolt was throwing stones at piles of stones a fair way off.  Kain was shouting words of encouragement.  Bolt took a second to line up his claw, swung it back and threw the tiny rock,  it flew through the air and just missed.  He picked up another and threw it; this one hit and knocked the pile over.  He ran up the path and back.  Kain watched him.  He turned and noticed Zack. <BR>  &#34;Oh hi Zack, how was the battle?&#34;  Kain said absent-mindedly.   <BR>  &#34;It was easy, our monsters are getting pretty strong.  We need a new challenge.&#34;   <BR>  A blaze of fire flew across the sky and landed nearby. It was a phoenix and it was wearing the armour that said it was delivering for IMA or FIMBA.  The phoenix dropped a scroll.  Zack picked it up and the others crowded around him. <BR>  &#34;It says:  You have been selected to fight in a secret tournament in the Indos woods.  Please do not tell anyone of this meeting or you will be expelled from the tournament.  Ima.&#34;  Zack read. <BR>  Kain started to get excited.   <BR>  &#34;I wonder why its all so secret.  How far is Indos?&#34;  Kain asked. <BR>  &#34;Hmmm... I dunno maybe four days from here.  Its a patch of woodland, nothing there.&#34;   <BR>  Bolt continued to train with Houndine for the day then the next day they set off.  Kain suddenly stopped. <BR>  &#34;I just thought of something.  Have you ever thought how strange it is that our monsters don&#39;t train an awful lot but still keep strong.  I think it may be because they are not on a ranch.  They are having to walk a lot and are building up stats that way.&#34;   <BR>  &#34;That would make since I suppose, I kept wondering how Houndine beat that Globula monster.  I think you may be right&#34;   <BR>  They walked for another two days training in between and resting.  Eventually they reached the forest and went in through the greenery.  The woods were thick and dark.   <BR>  &#34;Why would they hold a tourney here?&#34; Asked Zack.   <BR>  &#34;Beats me, i suppose it keeps it secret.&#34;  Kain said staring at the forest ceiling.  They walked on and on in silence.  The whole forest looked exactly the same.  They eventually reached a clearing and Bolt beeped in excitement.  There was a huge silver building.  It had a large arena in the centre but there were no people or monsters anywhere in sight.  Zack stopped as they walked up to the big bronze doors.  He wondered why there were no people their but then continued inside.  The inside was dark and cold. There was a sudden flash of light and a net burst at them.  Kain looked around, he was in a net and so were Zack and all the monsters.  Zack looked around angrily. <BR>  &#34;Ok, you kept us out and we will leave and not hurt you.&#34;  He shouted at the darkness.   <BR>  There was a smirk from the darkness then the room exploded into a rain of lightning.  In the center of the bolts stood a granity, Pixie sub breed Golem.  She had short green hair and was wearing a rock bikini.  Zack stared at her as she stopped her attack and the room returned to darkness.  Bolt nuzzled against Kain&#39;s leg in the darkness and the low growl of Houndine could be heard.  Two tiny pools of light appeared in the darkness.  They moved from side to side then disappeared.  Suddenly green balls of light fired into the air iluminating a log sawer, Arrow Head sub breed Mock.  It stopped firing and its eyes left two tiny pools of light before he closed them.  A red flame appeared in the darkness.  It moved up and to the side then two others appeared.  They moved around in a circle and showed the Trickster, Wracky sub breed Joker juggling the fire balls.  The balls fell to the floor and hissed out.  There was suddenly maniac laughing.  It was high pitched and quick at first then slowed down and got louder.  There was a bolt of lightning falling in the room and standing behind t was a draco hopper, Hopper sub breed Dragon.  The lightning ceased and the hoppers demented face faded.  Zack tried to make out the faces in the darkness but could not.  He knew the monsters were still there though because Houndine was still growling.  Slowly some torches were lit and Kain saw the four monsters standing there.   <BR>  The Granity stepped forward and bent her knees in a slight courtesy.  She looked at Kain and Zack then at their two monsters. <BR>  &#34;Welcome, my name is Garnet, I am a granity and a strong one at that.  These guys are my friends.&#34;  She spoke the words perfectly as if she were human.  She pointed to the Tricker. <BR>  &#34;This is tiny, he may be small but you will find it hard to hit him, he is a major in skill and speed.&#34;  Her finger pointed to the Draco hopper who was now bouncing happily and smiling with his long tongue hanging from his mouth. <BR>  &#34;This is mental, he is totally crazy but will hit you in a flash his skill and power are amazing.&#34; <BR>  Garnet&#39;s finger wondered past Mental and pointed at the Log Sawer.   <BR>  &#34;And finally this is Oak.  He may look scary and he is.  He may not be that fast but he can absorb all your hits with his startling defence and power.&#34;  <BR>Garnet looked at them.  Then smiled. <BR>  &#34;We are a superior race of monsters.  We are superior to humans.  We raise our own monsters  occasionally but we prefer to organise tournaments.  We capture some monsters then force them to compete. Your monsters have been slected to compete.  Oak please take them a way&#34;  Garnet turned and walked followed by Tiny and Mental.  Oak stummbeled over and grabbed the corner of the net.  Bolt beeped at him and Houndine tried to bite him through the net but they were eventually dragged to a prison cell.  The cell next to them was filled by four monsters.  Kain did not have a chance to see what they looked like.  The cell was wet and Bolt looked miserable as he walked up and down beeping.  In the corner was a disc machine, an older version of the machined at the lab.  The cell would have been quite big if the machine wasn&#39;t there.  Half the day went past and Tiny walked to their cell.  He swung his tiny scythe teasingly and it made a swishing noise.  He smiled at them evilly. <BR>  &#34;The tournament begins tomorrow.  There will be three matches.  I suggest you guys train until then.  Garnet slaughters the losing side so I suggest you try and win.  Tiny walked away from the cell then came back carrying a big sand bag.  He tossed it into the cell and threw a piece of rope in afterwards.  Kain picked up the rope and tied the sandbag to the ceiling.  Bolt and Houndine attacked the bag for a while then slept.  Kain and Zack were not as easily rested.  Kain was the last to sleep that night.  He watched Bolt snoozing gently.  Houndine was moving slightly as he dreamed.  Kain woke up.  He didn&#39;t remember falling asleep but he must of.  The others were all ready awake.  Zack looked at him from across the room where he had been patting Houndine.   <BR>  &#34;We got an hour until the battles.  You better wake up a bit.&#34;  Zack said solemnly.  <BR>  &#34;Who are we up against?&#34;  Asked Kain. <BR>  &#34;Wild monsters, they have no trainers.&#34;  Zack looked sadly at the wall seperating the two cells.  Kain and Bolt were playing catch with a pebble when two tridents, Naga sub breed Golem, slithered up to the cell.  They growled angrily showing their teeth and were wearing helmets.   <BR>  &#34;Garnet wants you to fight.  Get in the net or we will hurt you.&#34;  One forced the words out while the other threw a net into the cell. <BR>  Kain picked it up and to Zack&#39;s annoyed grunts got inside.  Bolt jumped in afterwards.  Zack shuffled in muttering to himself.  Houndine bounded in last and Kain sealed the net.  The Tridents pulled the net to a room and stood by it.  A few minuites later another monster was brought in.  The tridents conversed. <BR>  &#34;This ones been put with these two to even the teams.&#34;  Said the Monster in a low growl.  He tossed a small net next to Kain&#39;s one.  A small Prince hare, Hare cub breed Gali sat cowering in the corner of the net.  It eyed Bolt nervosly then sniffed him gently.  The Nagas went through a small door that lead to the stadium area.  One returned and pointed to Kain.   <BR>  &#34;You and the renocraft are on first.&#34;  The naga&#39;s speach was broken and grainy but it helped Kain and Bolt out of the net and sealed it around Houndine and Zack.  Kain and Bolt walked into the arena.  There were no spectators apart from the four monsters.  They watched and Garnet had a microphone.  She yelled into it. <BR>  &#34;The next masters cup is about to begin.  First match Bolt, Arrow Head, Hengar versus Citric, Kato, Suezo.&#34; <BR>  A yellow figuire stepped into the arena while Kain stepped into the trainer box.  The monster was short and round.  Its long tongue hung out and it held its hands apart and extended its claws.   <BR>  Bolt opened and snapped its pincers shut a few times then beeped aggressively.  Tiny blew a whistle three times and the match began.  Citric ran at Bolt with his claws in the air.  As he reached Bolt&#39;s metal face he brought them down hard and scratched Bolts head.  Bolt fell over backwards and Citric jumped in a summersault towards his starting position.  Bolt stood up and opened his claws.  Green rays of lightning shot from Bolt&#39;s pincers and little clouds of sand shot up in all directions as they struck the floor.  Citronie had smoke pouring from a wound in his chest and stood up slowly.  He held up his hands and his claws began to glow red.  He zoomed forward at great speed and struck Bolt with the sharp daggers.  Bolt fell on his side.  Garnet was staring at him waiting to see if it was a k.o.  She was about to announce the winner when Bolt stood up and lunged Citric with his sting.  Citric tried to claw it out but it didn&#39;t work and he slowly fell to the floor.   <BR>  &#34;Round one goes to trained monsters.&#34;  Garnet&#39;s voice rang out from the microphone.   <BR>  Two tridents slithered into the arena.  One picked up Citric&#39;s unconscious body and the other pushed Bolt towards the locker room.  Houndine and Zack left as soon as Kain walked in.  He looked to the net containing the prince hare.  It sniffled uncomfortably and looked at him.  Houndine was jumping from side to side waiting for the opponent to enter the arena.  A huge monster entered the battle area.  It was a whale wit legs and one long single horn.   <BR>  &#34;Match two is between Houndine the Tiger, tiger sub breed Tiger, and chunky the gooji, Zilla sub breed Tiger.&#34;  Garnet yelled into the speaker system.   <BR>  The whistle blew three times.  The gooji stomped forward and the whole stadium shook.  Houndine dived sideways as Chunky drove forward stamping his feet.  Houndine opened his mouth and fired a blizzard of ice and snow at the creatures leg.  It slowed then brushed the ice off with a huge furry paw.   <BR>  &#34;That&#39;s it Houndine, attack from afar.&#34;  Shouted Zack.   <BR>  Chunky stamped his foot on the ground and an earthquake ran through the stadium,  Houndine fell to his side as rocks cracked around him.  He managed to get back up but Chunky was allready driving his horn forward and it went straight through Houndines stomach.  Houndine fell to the floor and Garnet almost exploded with excitement. <BR>  &#34;Match two goes to Chunky, making the match at tie with the scores at one all.&#34; <BR>  Zack ran up to Houndine who was waking up.  He stared unhappily at Zack and then followed him back to the locker room.  Zack walked straight past Kain and up to the hare. <BR>  &#34;Hello, my names Zack.  We all had a battle and we need you to win.  If you don&#39;t then Garnet will hurt us.&#34; <BR>  The prince hare nodded and jumped from the net.  He was pushed into the stadium by a trident and stood waiting for an enemy.  There was a flash of green and a suezo appeared on the other side of the pitch. <BR>  &#34;Final match is between Fierce the prince hare, Hare sub breed Gali, and Orb the worm suezo, Suezo sub breed worm.&#34;  Garnet seemed desperate to start this match.  She instantly blew the whistle three times.  Orb coiled and uncoiled his tail several times then teleported right in front of Fierce.  He swung his tail twice but missed as Fierce jumped then ducked under it.  He swung it upwards and knocked Fierce flying. Fierce got up and bobbed slightly from one foot to the other.  He jumped up and kicked orb in the eye.  Orb spirraled into the sky.  He balanced in the air and his eye began to glow.  Fierce stood and waited looking up at the glowing eye.  Orb fired a blast of red lazer.  Fierce jumped back and the lazer ripped through the floor.   Orb landed on its tail and Fierce dived forwards with his arms spinning.  They all hit Orb and he fell to the ground.  Fierce jumped triumphantly.  Garnet smiled at Fierce then raised the microplone to her lips. <BR>  &#34;The winners are the trained team.  The wild team will be eliminated.&#34;  Garnet aimed a hand at the unconcieus Orb and lightning formed in it.  Fierce watched him.  He was undefended.  He would never survive.  Fierce jumped.  Lightning ran through the stadium and when it was gone Fierce lied on the floor, smoke coming from his arm. Garnet laughed as Zack, Houndine,  Kain and bolt came in.   <BR>  &#34;If you will rebel i will kill you instead.  Tiny get them.&#34;  She pointed at Bolt, Houndine, Chunky and Citric.  Two tridents took Fierce and Orb to the side of the stadium as the tiny joker landed on the floor.  He smiled then dived at Citric.  His scythe swung through the air and Citric ducked back.  Tiny jumoed in the air and swung his leg round in an arch kicking Citric in the back of the head.  Citric fell to the floor but swiped with his claws.  Tiny flew back and summasaulted over.  He turned to face Bolt.  Bolt threw his sting forward but tiny blocked it with his scythe.  He threw his scythe at Houndine.  It left a thin purple trail in the air.  Houndine dived over it and grabbed the clown in his teeth.  He swung him backwards and forwards until Tiny stopped resisting.  He dug a hole and dropped the inanimate doll, Houndines pushed the dirt back and the creature was buried.  Garnet seemed hardly bothered.  She clicked her fingers at Oak.  He jumped down from the chairs and swung his claws several times.  His yellow eyes glowed wickedly.  Chunky fired a powerful jet of bubbles that collided with the stadium wall.  Oak flew at Chunky with his claws open.  Chunky kicked him into the wall with his leg.  Oak flew back and jumped off.  Citric zoomed past him.  Oak laughed at him. <BR>  &#34;You didn&#39;t even hit me!&#34;  He said in an echoy voice. <BR>  There was a flash of purple lights and Oak slowly fell apart. <BR>  Garnet did not look happy.   She looked carefully at Mental who was laughing maniacly and rolling around on his back.  She sighed abd flew down.  Before she even reached the ground there was a ball of yellow and gold forming in her hands.  Citric dived at her.  Kain saw a flash of light and Citric fell backwards burning.  Bolt opened his claws and fired green blasts of energy.  A few hit but Garnet dodged most of them. She flew above them and landed on Chunky&#39;s head. There was another flash of light and the giant whale fell to the ground making a massive vibration.  Garnet looked down at Houndine and Bolt.  Houndine shot thunderbolts from his horn and they hit Garnet.  She fell to the ground then stood up calmly.  He hands began to move.  They wove in and out of each other.   <BR>  &#34;I can&#39;t beat you so I&#39;ll kill all of us with big bang.  It will destroy this stadium completely.  There was a sudden silence.  It wasn&#39;t the sound of no noise.  It was the lack of one noise.  A noise that had been going on since they had arrived at the stadium.  Mental had stopped laughing, he now stood up glowering at Garnet from behind her.  She didn&#39;t notice him stop laughing.  Garnets hands continued to wave around a slowly forming ball of purple. Mental lept forward with its paws up.  He slammed into Garnet&#39;s back and the ball disapeared.  He kept flicking at her back.  Garnet turned around with her hands covered in lightning.  She swung the light at Mental who dodged it easily and attacked again.  He ran up her body, kicked her in the face and summasaulted over.  He opened his mouth and spewed flames at Garnet.  Garnet slowly shrunk into a ring.  As the flames died down and a disc fell to the floor and mental began laughing again.  The tridents looked at Bolt and Houndine and ran from the stadium.  Zack ran over to Orb and Fierce then looked at Chunky and Citric.  Kain shook his head and Zack checked Orb&#39;s pulse.  He turned and quickly grabbed Fierce&#39;s wrist. <BR>  &#34;He&#39;s still alive, he isn&#39;t great but i think i know how we can save him.&#34; <BR>   The disc machine whirred and hummed. <BR>  &#34;Come one work <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> it!&#34;  Zack knocked the machine.  It sprung into life and the humming stopped.  Houndine stood on the first port and Zack slowly placed Fierce&#39;s body on the other.  He went to press the button.  Kain stopped him.   <BR>  &#34;Use this,  it might change the outcome of the combination.&#34; <BR>  Kain handed him the disc stone he had found before the group split up.  Zack placed it on the panel bearing it&#39;s mark.  Houndine and Fierce melted down into light and were absorbed by the machine.  The lights danced inside the machine and formed a globe shape.  Another two grew on top and two flipper appeared by the side of the middle one.  A long neck formed and a beaked mouth appeared.  Two legs shot out from the bottom.   <BR>  &#34;Its a Ducken.  They are quite rare.&#34;  Kain said nodding.  The ducken stared at Zack and quaked quietly.  Zack smiled, <BR>  &#34;I think I&#39;ll call him Fierce, that little hare saved our butts.&#34;  Fierce crwaled from the machine and danced slightly.  Three days later the two trainers stood at the hotel in Geva.  Bolt was eating a ball of rice and Fierce was dancing around in a swimming pool.  Zack and Kain were now alone but they knew they would continue to get stronger.  Soon they would enter a real tournement.   <BR>   <BR>As always please post what you think below and feel free to be critical, its the only way my next story will get better.  Also please post some story ideas for The Kain saga and a new character you would like included.  Please also post their monster. Thankyou                         <BR>    <BR>P.s. look i spelt my name right for once.

 Well I like the action, but your story tends to jump around a lot and you need to find ways to blend things into your story, I made a lot of these mistakes while writing as well. <BR> <BR>Like it&#39;ll say like &#34;A prince hare, a hare/gali...&#34;  Try to make it blend somehow, I&#39;m not a great writer myself so... it&#39;d be like &#34;A white hare which looked to have some noble gali blood flowing in it&#39;s veins...&#34;

 you have a reader, garlant, but your structure makes it a little difficult.  indenting is hard on this board, but if you seperate thought clusters with a line of white by hitting enter twice, that will make things easier to follow. <BR> <BR>on the plus side, i enjoy your descriptions of battles.
