 Chapter One <BR>	In the deep forest there was nothing but silence for a young boy and his faithful monster. The silence was broke when one of Moo’s servants swept through the forest like a mad man. His monster and himself were ragged and thrashed, although they were hardy by being able to survive so long in Moo’s territory.  <BR>	Minutes later the thrashing through the trees stopped, but now the silence was much more intimidating. The boy and his monster were leaning against a tree and listening for the slightest hint of the monster that was pursuing them.  <BR>	The boy was struggling to get up while his monster was getting under him to carry him. They had gotten a long way before Moo’s servant showed itself. It was a joker.  <BR>	“Moo doesn’t like people on his territory, he instructed me to kill all who invades the forest. So… it is your time little one. The boy is no use, but you, an Octopee may be of use to Moo…” In mid sentence the Octopee set the boy down and used Octo-baloon, the joker was well trained and barely got hit by it, on the cheek of his mask. <BR>	“A well trained Octopee. So just give me the boy, I’ll kill him and we’ll live in harmony.” <BR>	The Octopee remained silent and when the joker attacked the Octopee dodged it easily. The joker kept talking smack about how he is going to kill the boy. Octopee caught the joker off guard and nailed him strait in the chin with a Capoeira. The joker was knocked unconscious while the boy and his monster got away into the city by the forest. <BR>	“Help! Help! We need a doctor, not for a monster, a human. Please!!!” Octopee’s voice was heard and loud by the human doctor in the bustling city. The doctor came to take a look at the boy, his name was Ken.	 <BR>“We can take him to our hospital, we have one of the best in the world. It will be around 10,000 dollars for this kind of treatment.” <BR>The Octopee hastily said yes for it and gave the doctor the cash. The doctor told the Octopee to wait outside for an hour. He did obediently. He had some time to kill so he went to an all monster buffet, with the money he had left he bought a meal for a king.

 Uh...Ahem. This is about the caliber of my first story, and is a mite confusing, in addition to being awfully short for an epic. I wonder how long you though about this, got editors and such.

 What he said. <BR> <BR>Make it longer, and be sure to break up your story into paragraphs next time, makes it easier to follow. <BR> <BR>Slang words not used directly as a monster&#39;s quote annoy me, too. I.E. &#34;The joker kept talking smack&#34;
