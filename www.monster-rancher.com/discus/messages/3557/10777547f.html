 Ok, I want to try out this FF stuff... Please give comments, any, even flaming, is appreciated... Just don&#39;t be too harsh on me:P <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>My name is Brick. No real name, just... Brick. I found my first pancho working at a shrine. Boy, was that ever fun. <BR> <BR> I started working at the shrine because I needed money. I didn&#39;t know anything about where I came from, only that I awoke one day in Kalaragi and ended up living in Brillia. Day after day, lugging disks into the slots, and watching the lights glow as I scrambled to get off of the platform before I was blown twenty feet in the air by a beaklon who had materialized under my feet. But it was all worth it to see the happy face on the new owner of a monster. However, some ranchers weren&#39;t all that happy, and I had to find another disk for them. I usually slept at the shrine, because many monsters had been regenerated and not taken. Oh sure, I loved them all, but none suited me right. I&#39;d give some away to people who wanted monsters with experience, or people with kind hearts.  <BR> <BR>One day, the shrine keeper, the one who knew the words to unlock the monsters, came to me and said: &#34;You have done me great service. You may choose one disk and unlock it.&#34; I chose the disk in the corner of the shrine, it looked so lonely, almost like it was a disk that was afraid of the others somehow. It was a pancho, but the second it appeared, it clamped it&#39;s pumpkin shut and wouldn&#39;t let anybody in. &#34;Oh... You might not want that one...&#34; the shrine keeper said. &#34;Very timid. Not for beginners.&#34; I protested, and at first he would not agree, but I wouldn&#39;t give up. I got to take him home, but I had to carry him all the way, seeing as he refused to come out of the pumpkin. What a sore back I had the next day. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Actually, I&#39;m pretty proud of myself! It was my first attempt. Again, any comments are appreciated!

 I&#39;ve been out of the swing of things latley, and since I&#39;m on leave, I&#39;m definatly not taking time out of my family to work on my stories/tourney monsters. <BR> <BR>Either way, longer would be better, and more adjatives. You seem to have a firm grasp on what you want this story to produce, so go for it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll keep up as I can. Good Luck.

 Thanks guys! Yes, I&#39;m starting to develop an obbsession with panchos, but there are only so many different panchos in mr3 :P I didn&#39;t make it that long because it was just a prologue, but thanks for pointing that out!
