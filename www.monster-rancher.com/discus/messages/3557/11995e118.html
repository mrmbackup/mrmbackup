 Lighting rippled through the massive bulk of the dark creature as drool and snot fell before him. He fell to his hands and knees gasping for air and the monstrous Durahan walked closer with a sort of cockiness in his strut. He walked behind Zeke and raised his blade, would it be the final slash he swung? Meanwhile, the only people who could view the fight were those who had gone home. The T.V. crews were watching in a helicopter and the arena was empty.  <BR> <BR>The blade fell, could this be the match? No! Zeke rolled out of the way and into safety he stood up and shook of the horrible charge he got and he tackled Elizkee and rammed him into the bleachers. They fought each other on the first row going claw for blade. No ground was given up as they fought for position. Many dagger-like blades sprouted from Zeke’s body and this time the charged that was done turned Elizkee into a Swiss cheese. Elizkee was helplessly connected as he was flung into the air and the Zan jumped after him he cocked his fist back as he floated in air; he was going to the deliver a death blow to the infamous killer himself.  <BR> <BR>Seconds later a head flew. It was that of a Dragon-like helmet. Zeke landed on his feet as Elizkee crashed into the ground a thud was all that Zeke heard before he collapsed. Zeke never woke up after that, but his master from 75 years ago did show up at his freezer. A tear fell from his eyes as he set the Championship Trophy on his freezer. <BR>  <BR> <BR>Sorry for the horribly short ending, ideas were limited and this wasn&#39;t that popular to begin with. I am working on something else though. I have 7 chapters done, too. It won&#39;t be seen til I feel like typing it out. -_-

 It looks like you rushed this one, and I always think the endoing chapter should be one of the better chapters in the story

 I agree with Da_mullet, odd and morbid. Not quite as good, as the other chapters but still fairly good.
