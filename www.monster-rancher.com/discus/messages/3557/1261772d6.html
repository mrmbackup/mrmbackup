<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:dstsaoi@comcast.net>DarkBlitzX</A></B> on <B>Sunday, February 27, 2005 - 02:38 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 A gauntleted foot stepped into the competitor&#39;s booth. It was followed by a gauntleted hand. Then a sword hilt. Then a body wearing armor so bright that none could bear to look at it. <BR> <BR>Except Darkness. <BR> <BR>&#34;X-Blade..&#34; <BR> <BR>The shimmering Durahan regarded Darkness with his piercing blue eyes. &#34;Now, Darkness, there&#39;s no need for violence, is there?&#34; From the shadows behind him, the Reflector summoned his most powerful minions, Hammer the Ducken and Sharpener the Doodle. <BR> <BR>&#34;It is a shame you defeated suzybee. Still, it was only my pet. Perhaps you will fare as well against my more...choice warriors.&#34; X-Blade smirked and walked off to the other end of the booth. his generals followed him. <BR> <BR>Darkness turned to his council leaders. &#34;Make no worry of them. Undoubtedly you will have to fight them, but we will win. Now get out there Nightstalker, and good luck.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Durahan grinned, as best a suit of armor CAN grin, and then walked onto the field. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the C class official tourney, presented by AFI! This tournamanet will be a notch above E and D class! Be prepared for fighting as yet unseen today!&#34; <BR> <BR>------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>Nightstalker clapped some dirt onto his hands and rubbed it around. &#34;Let&#39;s do this.&#34; He slung his sword from its sheath and spun it in the air a few times. He stuck the sword in the ground and pulled his shield from his back. Grabbing the leather handles, he bound it to his right arm and pulled his sword back up from the dirt.  <BR> <BR>A fairly large antlan walked into the arena. It&#39;s muscles bluged as it summoned fire into it&#39;s fists. <BR> <BR>The bell rang. <BR> <BR>The two opponents charged at each other. When they were about five feet away from each other, Nightstalker put his sword in front of him in a stabbing posistion. He hit nothing but air as the antlan  flipped into the air and came down on his back, pushing him into the dirt. The flying Durahan rolled to the side just in time to miss being cut in half by the antlan&#39;s antlers.  <BR> <BR>Nightstalker&#39;s wings flapped and dirt few from the ground as he rose into the air. He made a circle around the stadium, then dived until he was skimming the ground. The antlan pulled it&#39;s antlers out of the ground and turned around just in time to be tackled full force by a flying Durahan going 70 mph.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Ding! and Nightstalker has won the match!&#34; <BR> <BR>10 minutes later, the Durahan walked onto the field to meet his next opponent, a henger. <BR> <BR>&#34;3..2..1..GO!&#34; <BR> <BR>this time, Nightstalker instantly took to the air. Dodging blasts of energy, he stopped right above the henger and plummeted as fast as he could, sword out stretched. The crowd gasped. What was the crazy Durahan doing? He was going to crash. The henger easily sidestepped the place where Nightstalker was going to land. the announcer was getting ready to announce the hengers win. It turned out to be premature. <BR> <BR>Just 3 feet from becoming a jagged metal stain on the stadium floor, Nightstalker snapped his wings open and used the air resistance to just suddenly stop. The resulting implosion of air from such a sudden movement cause the henger to go flying up in the air. Without anything to control his flight, the henger came directly down on the flying Durahan&#39;s sword. The crowd roared in exhilaration. A thouroughly suprised Francesca&#40; the announcer&#41; announced the Durahan&#39;s win.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;And the winner of the match is... Nightstalker!&#34; <BR> <BR>Then, the Durahan waited another 10 minutes for his last match of the day. He walked out onto the field to a suprise. x-Blade&#39;s number 3, Apeman the gitan. The most scary thing about this Gitan was the size of it&#39;s muscles and spear. They were HUGE! The size of one arm was the size of Nightstalker himself, and nightstalker was 7 feet tall. Also, the gitan&#39;s spear was the size of a lightpole. The overall impression was a bunny with buildings for arms, swinging a giant tree.  <BR> <BR>Nightstalker coldly regarded the gitan. &#34;Apeman.&#34; <BR> <BR>The gitan returned the Durahan&#39;s stare. &#34;Nightstalker.&#34;  <BR> <BR>The bell had barely even rung before both opponents went at it with all their energy. They had good reason, for Apeman had killed Nightstalker&#39;s mentor. In return, Nightstalker had fought and killed almost all of the gitan&#39;s brothers and sisters. It was no longer a amtter of winning, but of revenge. <BR> <BR>Nightstalker&#39;s eyes glowed red, as did the gitan&#39;s. Bolts of lightning streaked form the gitan&#39;s spear as Nightstalker drew closer. Finally, sword met spear in a battle of skill and dexterity.  <BR> <BR>the Durahan parried a thrust, then attempted to get closer to the monster. However, the gitan&#39;s spear was succeding in keeping the Durahan at bay. Nightstalker could not even succeed in getting withing 10 feet.  <BR> <BR>As both monster&#39;s began to draw upon auxiliary reserves of energy, the Durahan grew worried. he knew he could not win this way. But would he chance it? It was time to find out what was harder, his shield or the gitan&#39;s spear. <BR> <BR>Apeman watched in puzzlement as the Durahan suddenly flew backwards, flapping his wings furiously. The Durahan then took flight and flew around in a few circles gaining speed. Nightstalker then flew forward at the gitan, shield in front of his face and sword at the ready. Apeman held up his spear and waited for the seemingly psychotic Durahan to impale himself. <BR> <BR>The collision that ensued blew out the entire first sand of bleachers. The gitan was pushed back into the stadium wall until he hit a titanium pole. He watched on as his spear crumpled under the Durahan&#39;s dive.  <BR> <BR>Just as the gitan&#39;s weapon was reduced to the length of a twig, Nightstlaker dropped his shield to reveal his sword. It pierced the gitan&#39;s head.
