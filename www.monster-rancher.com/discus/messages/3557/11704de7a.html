 Yes, the title is weird, but this is a short story I worte a long time ago, actually in March it will have been one year. This is, by far, the best short story I&#39;ve ever written. Hope you like it! <BR> <BR>Bill, the World&#39;s First Dogstranaut <BR> <BR>The year was 1962. The Russians had just sent the first dog into outer space. With great fanfare, the United States responded with Bill. Bill, a Siberian husky, was loaded into the spacecraft. Eros was ready to take off on a little jaunt into space.  <BR>	 <BR>Bill was a beautiful dog with a silky coat. A normally nonchalant dog, his fur stood on end as there was an ominous feeling in the air on the day of the launch. He dawdled; taking his time to make sure that there was no dilapidated equipment. Eventually, a complacent feeling settled over him. <BR>	 <BR>Three…Two…One…BLAST OFF!!! As the rockets prepared to ignite, they let out a wavering drone, followed by a metallic bellow. As if it were magnetically repelled from the launch pad, the rocket soared into the air and emitted a loud roar which nearly deafened Bill. <BR>	   <BR>As the shuttle shuddered on its ascent into space, miscellaneous objects started to whirl around the room, nearly pummeling Bill. Before he knew it, he caught a fleeting glance of a large, silver box which was on a crash course to his muzzle. He quickly dodged it, but was hit in mid-air with a loose control panel. He knew he would probably be lost in space just like the Russian dog, as he blacked out. <BR>	 <BR>As a disheveled Bill emerged from the hull of a decrepit space vehicle, he inspected his surroundings. He found a lot of red sand with cracked sticks and heaps of rocks. A sallow-faced Bill realized he could not escape this barren wasteland. <BR>	 <BR>Just as Bill was about to lose hope, he discovered a glob of goop sitting on a rock. Whatever it was, it had been alive at one point. All the commotion came to a halt when an <BR>uproar of screams and other sounds could be heard in the distance.  <BR>	 <BR>Bill stumbled on his way up a winding trail of red sand when he came to a halt at the top of the peak. What he saw he would never forget. <BR>	 <BR>A battle was being fought between green blobs and purple blobs. They were obviously at war. Before Bill could totter away, he was stopped by an amazing creature. <BR>	 <BR>A purple blob held out an arm that looked like a long tube of snot. It was roughly the size of a refrigerator albeit that could walk and talk. It let out a patronizing gloat: “What is your business here you putrid fur ball?” <BR>	 <BR>Bill saw that the blob was pulling out what appeared to be the wooden handle of a sword. Bill knew this morphological being was about to do him in.  <BR>	 <BR>“Stand back you paltry ball of fleas, ticks, heartworm, and dirty paws. My weapon of mass destruction is a fine piece of work. It will make you wish you had never been born,” he screamed brusquely. <BR>	 <BR>“This guy has a lot of gall to challenge a ferocious sled dog,” Bill thought to himself.  <BR>	 <BR>“I heard that you pile of poop. I was born with the ability to read minds at a close distance. Anything you think, I will hear as if you said it,” he muttered to Bill’s surprise. <BR>	 <BR>Bill closed his eyes as the handle emerged from the sheath; Bill knew it was the end. A mysterious object came crashing down onto his head. Instead of blood and guts, Bill yelped as he received a… splinter? The purple blob raised his weapon high. <BR>	 <BR>“Ha… ha… ha…, are you feeling the burn of my power fur ball?” the blob said as his weapon wavered in the air. <BR>	 <BR>Bill looked up and realized just how primitive these guys were. <BR>	 <BR>“Alright, you could have hit me with a sword, spear, knife, club, katana, or a rapier. But no, you hit me with a stick. I mean, come on. Who hits a dog with a stick? I catch sticks you MORON!” Bill contemptuously exclaimed. <BR>	 <BR>Just then a green blob came soaring out of nowhere and plowed over the purple one. He then slithered off like a snake. Bill knew he was being helped, so he chased after the green blob. <BR>	 <BR>“Greetings my hairy friend, it is good to see you live and well. You survived a powerful blow from one of the most powerful weapons of the Fourth Rock,” he said. <BR>	 <BR>“The Fourth Rock, what is that?” <BR>	 <BR>“It is the fourth rock from the heavenly sphere of powerful forces.” <BR>	 <BR>“You mean the sun. I get it now. This is the fourth planet from the sun. This is Mars, the Fourth Rock.” <BR>	 <BR>“Where are you from my furry friend?” <BR>	 <BR>“I am from Earth, the Third Rock.” <BR>	 <BR>“Wonderful. A visitor from the Third Rock!!! This is very exciting. Take me to your vessel.” <BR>	 <BR>As Bill and his new friend approached the shuttle, Bill found that a ham sandwich and a fork survived the crash. Bill started to talk about his new found objects, when he was interrupted on the word fork. <BR>	 <BR>“A fork, hmmm…, sounds deadly. What is it and what is its function? <BR>	 <BR>“A fork is used for eating food. You insert it into the food and eat it,” Bill explained. <BR>	 <BR>“Well, I suppose it is time to tell you about our predicament. You see, I am a Plankticon. We are the green blobs. The purple blobs are the Villatrons. We have been at war for as long as my transparent thinker can remember. We fight using the latest technology. We call them, STICKS and STONES. Sticks are the wooden rods used to disembowel your opponent. You had a close call with one back there. A stone is thrown at the enemy to break their molecular build-up and make them inoperable. Our war has caused much rancor between the two blob species, that we have vowed to never spare each other if we surrender. The war, however, is stupid. It was caused when a young Villatron accused a Plankticon of calling him a booger. The clan leader of the Villatrons heard this, and declared war.” <BR>	 <BR>“Wow, a silly misdemeanor caused so much trouble. This is not good, not good at all,” Bill replied. <BR>	 <BR>“Each tribe has a sacred weapon,” the Plankticon explained, “The Villatron clan leader posses the Rod of Dark Illusions. We Plankticons value and worship the Mineral Composition of the Chaos Power.” <BR>	 <BR>“Man, your weaponry is dated. The Rod of Dark Illusions and the Mineral Composition of the Chaos Power… COME ON! You can do better than that. Don’t you have anything else?” <BR>	 <BR>“Well, we could hurl our own waste at the Villatrons.” <BR>	 <BR>“Sorry I asked,” Bill muttered. <BR>	 <BR>Seven years passed as the fighting continued. Bill fought the Villatrons with all his might. He hurled sticks, stones, and… forks? Actually, forks were deadly. They easily cut open unsuspecting Villatrons. Bill fought many battles such as the Battle of Mt. Olympia, the Battle of Red Desert, and the Battle of…Fork? The Battle of Fork was named after a fork because Bill disemboweled the second in command of the Villatrons with his favorite, shiny fork. <BR>	 <BR>Finally, the final battle was at hand. Bill had been promoted to general. As the Villatrons came into view, General Bill led the Plankticons to the fight that would be known as the Battle of Heaven’s Rain. <BR>	 <BR>Loud screams could be heard as the forces of the Plankticons and the Villatrons clashed in an all out frenzy. Bill was hit with a large stone and fell to the ground. A Villatron came charging at Bill with a stick aimed for Bill’s head. Before the fatal blow hit, Bill unsheathed a stick from a white oak tree and plunged it into the Villtron’s abdomen. He exploded. One Villatron was down, with ten thousand more to kill. The battle raged on with puddles of fallen warriors littering the open mountain range. Bill slashed, stabbed, and chopped Villatrons down to size.  <BR>	 <BR>The battle raged on for the next four hours. Bill was tired, hungry, and thirsty. Bill knew he would have to end this now, or forever be condemned to the bowels of the Martian heaven.  <BR>	 <BR>Just as all hope was lost, an acid rain sprang from the sky. It halted the actions of the Villatrons and Plankticons, but Bill’s fur protected him from the rain, as if heaven itself was giving Bill an opportunity to end not just the battle, but the war as well. <BR>	 <BR>Bill raced through the millions of souls that the rains were condemning. He slashed many Villatrons before watching the Villatron clan leader escape into a cave. Bill followed. <BR>	 <BR>Inside the dark, damp fissure, Bill wound around stalactites and stalagmites as he made his way through the maze of darkness. Bill felt purple slime on the walls. He knew that he was a one dog army charging into the secret base of an alien race. <BR>	 <BR>Bill made his way out to find the Villatron leader holding a stick that shone with a silver glow. It had to be the Rod of Dark Illusion. <BR>	 <BR>To the clan leader’s surprise, Bill leaped out of nowhere and stole the rod.  <BR>	 <BR>“Come back here fur ball,” screamed the clan leader, “The power of the rod belongs to me.” <BR>	 <BR>Bill emerged from the opening with the rod. He raised the rod high, and unleashed a tidal wave of dark forces that swallowed three quarters of the Villatron army. The rest of the Villatrons saw this, and quickly surrendered. It was over, the war was won. <BR>	 <BR>Bill brought the Rod of Dark Illusion to the Plankticon leader. <BR>	 <BR>“How can I ever repay you Bill? You have brought the Fourth Rock into a time of peace.” <BR>	 <BR>“Is there any way I could get home?” Bill asked. <BR>	 <BR>“Yes, the Mineral Composition of the Chaos Power can grant one soul, one wish. If you like, you can wish for a vehicle.” <BR>	 <BR>Bill put both paws on the magical rock. At that moment, the Eros space shuttle was magically put back together and teleported to the cave. <BR>	 <BR>After saying his goodbyes, Bill left Mars with a place in history. <BR> <BR>1969: Neil Armstrong is the first man on the moon. While he is planting the flag, he looked up and let out a scream. The Eros space shuttle plowed over Mr. Armstrong.     <BR>   <BR>Bill was taken back to Earth, and commemorated as Bill, the World’s First Dogstranaut. <BR> <BR>I really love this story. I hope you liked it! -Icelord13

 thanks. This was actually a school assignment I did with a partner. Even though I wrote the final draft with my own ideas, I did it building of my partner&#39;s 1 page thing. I have to give him credit. Thamks Jeremy for helping me with this story!
