 The bulk of Zeke was being tormented with the horrid streaks of lightning that consumed him. The Mighty Zan’s eyes bulged as he fell to his hands and knees. Elizkee was getting sick of the battle and he was going to violently end the short life of Zeke. The black monster remained on his hands and begun to vomit as masses of food and other strange objects came out. Steam had surrounded Zeke in the darkness, 2 lights weren’t destroyed and they shined at the battle as T.V. crews taped the battle in the air. The Zan’s massive muscle were gone, he was slender and back to his first form. He stood to his feet and glared at Elizkee. He was the murderer of many monsters; he was never challenged in this Tournament of Legends. He killed legends! Not the regular monsters that we hear about, the legends that people grew up with. He killed much more than just monsters, he killed people’s hopes, he killed idols he killed dreams.  <BR> <BR>Drool seeped from Zeke’s lip as he wiped it away, both we tired and not willing to lose. The slender creature dashed at the Durahan. He was a lot faster than Elizkee expected and went 3 holes were punctured into the head of Elizkee he was stunned. Elizkee was knocked in mid air; he seemed to float as Zeke sprinted to get the next blow. He jumped at him leading with his feet. A hollow hit sounded as Zeke connected and Elizkee hit the ground and rolled. He laid there, he too fought for something. His only goal was to be the strongest. He wanted to prove that no other was able to challenge him and now he’s fighting someone who can take everything he worked for away. He clenched the sword tightly his cold metal hand seemed to be glued to the sword as he let a barrage of slashes and slices. Zeke jumped, rolled and did whatever was needed to avoid the blows. Then a horrible attack came upon Zeke. Elizkee was trapped Zeke in midair and he swung his sword upwards.  <BR> <BR>Zeke landed on his side, not falling like he normally does. No grace a quick thud. Crimson blood poured out as Zeke lay on the ground. Elizkee knew it as well as Zeke did, the blood leaked down Elizkee’s sword and poured onto his hand. That was a familiar thing for Elizkee, blood. He loved it when it got messy, but being a man of metal he never knew the pain of being hurt like that. Zeke staggered as he stood up, it was his left foot, severed upwards. A clean slice had trailed up from his foot al the way to his calf, blood ran non stop. Zeke ignored it, he no longer cared, and he was the only person in history to be mentioned that could defeat this monster. He wouldn’t let him get the glory of being the best. His speed was shot as he ran much slower at Elizkee. Another swing this one hit Zeke’s head. Then in a furious burst of energy 20 Zan’s appeared and struck Elizkee he was being pelted with many different blows and dents became visible and little holes became larger. Elizkee swung his sword wildly trying to stop. Zeke’s blood flew from his foot and the area was becoming a large blood bath. Then the Zan’s disappeared and Zeke appeared right in front of Elizkee and he raised his fist back and delivered the most bone-crushing punch ever. Elizkee ripped through the side of the stadium and into the street outside of the stadium. Zeke’s wound was healing itself slowly as he walked out of the arena. Elizkee lay dazed in the side of a building as many people who were watching the fight in that building scurried out.  <BR> <BR>People now tried to leave the town as the monster went claw for sword ripping through cars and buildings. Debris flew through the sky as they bashed each other, this became a brawl, no organization just the will to destroy the other. The action slowed down after Zeke was impaled by the sword of Elizkee. A stream of blood shot out of Zeke’s back as Elizkee lifted up the sword and stared into the eyes of Zeke. They looked dead as the rolled back into his head as he made many gagging noises. Elizkee held the sword outwards and sent a pulsating lightning attack through it. Zeke’s body went into a seizure as he flailed his arms and legs screaming as the lightning went through his body. Elizkee swung him of the sword and through a glass window of a Taco Bell. Elizkee walked into the empty place and looked for Zeke; he couldn’t find him he was hidden in the back as he grabbed a taco and ate it. He’s been fighting for so long he needed something. The horrible taste of it caused him to vomit, giving his location. Elizkee ripped through the wall and attacked Zeke. Zeke dodged the stab and kicked Elizkee in the head and ran by. He got a clear shot of Elizkee’s back and he gave him a sharp kick which knocked him into a wall. Zeke ran out and jump up on top of Taco Bell and waited for Elizkee to come out of the building and as soon as he did he dove right at him. Smashing them both into the ground and the clawed and fought for something. Screams could be heard from the hole as the ripped through each other. Elizkee was kicked out as Zeke jumped from the hole. His right arm was gone and his stomach had been cut badly, but Elizkee had no head. Zeke fell to his knees as he stared at the body. The town was empty; no one was going to declare him the champion. He just stared as the pain took over blood ran down his chest and side.  <BR> <BR>Elizkee’s began to shake as Zeke watched; he knew he had no strength to fight back if he came back to life. He thought of what just happened, he could see his claws ripping into Elizkee as his sword came around and cut him. He stood up and looked into the hole, blood… Blood and Elizkee’s head was all the dwelled there. Zeke smiled as he knew, he was the champion. <BR> <BR> <BR>This is better than the first ending... Hope you like it!
