The young boy&#39;s eyes pulled and squinted as the sun beamed overhead. The arena was nothing special, with its earthen floor of desert and old, almost ancient looking walls. The massive iron doors had trace rust on parts as well, but this was home. This was the closest arena to their home, and it was where his dreams thrived and were nurtured. <BR> <BR>He&#39;d become the best some day. <BR> <BR>He eagerly placed his hand on the divider, still amazed and all too thrilled for front row seats. His brown hair ripped into the air above him, and his dirty yellow shirt was visible under his overalls. He bounced with glee, unable to control his happiness. <BR> <BR>&#34;Calm down, my boy. Don&#39;t get excited just yet, the first match hasn&#39;t even happened.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, mother.&#34; The child moaned, dipping his head and taking his seat. <BR> <BR>Almost instantly, he was alive again with, &#34;I&#39;m kind of hungry, can we go to the food stand?&#34; <BR> <BR>His mother smiled, pushing her long brunette hair out of her lovely blue eyes. Slowly, her other hand brought her raw hide purse to her lap, and began rummaging inside. The boy&#39;s sister bounded happily off the concrete bench. She smiled happily that her brother had asked instead of her, since she was always a little shy. <BR> <BR>&#34;Be right back.&#34; Their mother smiled lightly, passing a small bag of coins to the older sibling. <BR> <BR>&#34;All right! We will mom.&#34; <BR> <BR>With that, the pair of kids cheerfully made their way up the stadium stairs. <BR> <BR>Later...at the food stand... <BR> <BR>&#34;I want a turkey leg, please.&#34; The small boy piped up, his sister&#39;s fingers and eyes peering over the counter. <BR> <BR>The large, older man smiled, the skin on each side of his face pressed up, making his eyes look more squinted than they already were. He complied, turning back to the pair with a giant, meaty, greasy, delicious looking turkey leg in his hand. The four eyes were fixated on the feast as the man&#39;s burly hand reached down and grasped a clean rag, placing it around the bone of the titanic fowl&#39;s leg. <BR> <BR>&#34;Will that be all?&#34; The elderly man asked in all smiles. <BR> <BR>&#34;Whoa...&#34; His sister gasped as he dangled the behemoth leg over their heads. <BR> <BR>&#34;Um, can I get a smaller one for my baby sister?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey, I&#39;m not a baby!&#34; His sibling piped in defense. <BR> <BR>The man snorted a small chuckle as he turned back towards the rack of meats, returning with a smaller, but still by their scale, gargantuan turkey leg. <BR> <BR>&#34;How much for them?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;10 gold a piece.&#34; <BR> <BR>The boy emptied the bag on the counter, counting up a grand total of 16 coins. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh...um...&#34; The boy spat slowly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh my, I forgot!&#34; The old man laughed, slapping his forehead with his left hand, &#34;It is a buy one get one free day.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Really?&#34; The sister asked, her eyes growing large at the mammoth thigh. <BR> <BR>The boy smiled, knowing all too well that this was purely out of kindness, and added a quiet, &#34;Thank you.&#34; <BR> <BR>His sister exploded into glee as the smaller of the two was placed in her waiting hands. The old man placed seven coins back in the pouch instead of six, and again the boy noticed his charity at work. <BR> <BR>&#34;Come again!&#34; The man shouted as the pair walked off, smiling like it was plastered on his face. <BR> <BR>His sister waved back gingerly, but the boy only nodded. He hated being poor, truly he did. How his mother had gotten them front row seats, he&#39;d never know. This would all change though. He&#39;d support his family once he got his ranch started. Getting funding for that would prove more difficult... <BR> <BR>His mind snapped back into reality as his sister squealed as her prized food was ripped from her hands. He glanced up at the pair of thugish looking brutes, one holding her meal by its cloth covered bone. <BR> <BR>&#34;Thanks, doll face. You know this was too much for you to eat anyway.&#34; <BR> <BR>The boy wondered if they could just not see how malnourished she looked, or if they even cared. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey, give it back!&#34; He shouted. <BR> <BR>The pair laughed slightly, as a third joined their ranks, holding a small pouch. <BR> <BR>&#34;Nice swipe, Jeff. I managed to get a bag of coins off some old dude coming down the stairs. This is going to be a good day for us.&#34; <BR> <BR>The child gritted his teeth, as the trio laughed and his sister&#39;s eyes began tearing up, gazing hopelessly at her lost food. He slowly handed his to his sister. <BR> <BR>She stopped, gazing at it in astonishment, then towards her brother. It was full blown crying now, at the thought of her eating what he had planned to, but he didn&#39;t care. He knew he couldn&#39;t take out three men in their mid twenties anyway. <BR> <BR>&#34;I say, that just wasn&#39;t very polite of you...&#34; <BR> <BR>It was an older voice, almost foreign. It echoed with a since of nobility, and a hint of purpose. In that phrase alone, both children knew that the owner of it, was the type to get things done. <BR> <BR>The man walked between them, his black cape fluttered up and past their heads, and they could see the red lining underneath. His chest had something like black armor, but it bent and molded with his chest, and he was walking as if it were merely clothing. His hands were in his pocket as he approached the thieves, and neither of the children got a good glimpse of his face. <BR> <BR>&#34;You better step back, old man.&#34; The one holding the turkey leg muttered, raising it to his open mouth. <BR> <BR>His mouth was instantly full, but the young boy doubted he was expecting a black boot. The turkey leg began falling back as well, still in his grip. Suddenly, the man&#39;s hand lashed out, grabbing his wrist, his left hand still securely in his black trench coat pocket. <BR> <BR>The thug grasped his bloody jaw with his right hand, staring in fear at his left, still held tight in the grasp of this stranger. The black glove released the thief&#39;s wrist, and slid up to the bone of the turkey leg. Slowly, he passed it behind him, into the waiting hands of the older brother. <BR> <BR>&#34;Old man? Well, what ever you wish to label me as, you still have something that belongs to me.&#34; <BR> <BR>The injured gangster stood slowly, his eyes glazed with a passion for retribution. His fellows braced for combat, unsure of what this man wanted. Suddenly, the one with the gold coin bag widened his stance. <BR> <BR>&#34;I got it off you fair and square, so back off.&#34; <BR> <BR>The cloaked man stood silent for a moment, then spoke as if from literature, &#34;I&#39;m certain I could dance verbal circles around your ignorance for days if I choose to, but I think I will reframe from such courses of action and break this into something even the three of you could understand.&#34; <BR> <BR>They stared at him, unsure of what to make of this scholar, or was he a warrior, or a poet? It didn&#39;t matter, they were going to have to teach him a lesson. <BR> <BR>Slowly, the man pulled his other hand from his pocket. The black, studded gloves pulled tightly into fists, the leather warping in the palms, as he finally spoke, &#34;That is the stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever heard.&#34; <BR> <BR>The thieves were almost prepared to strike, but realized all too late that this was a man of action. The first thug grasped his face following the second punch it received, and the strange hero planted his knee into his mid section. The first toppled forward as he was axe handled in the back of his head, falling to the ground with an unconscious thud. <BR> <BR>The second and third swung at him, but found all their punches deftly avoided. The black boot flew between them, skipping from one head to the other. They both fell back, more shocked than hurt. The one with the coin bag saw only a blur of black and red as the trench coat flailed in front of him. Somewhere in the spin, the dark heel collided with his jaw, careening this second vagabond into a nearby stone column. <BR> <BR>The third kicked at the shadowy figure&#39;s head, but found his foot grasped inches from its target. The foot was instantly tucked under the old man&#39;s arm, and cinched in place by the powerful grasp. <BR> <BR>The children watched in utter awe as the man, still holding the third thief&#39;s foot, proceeded to kick him over and over with his own right boot. The man threw the thug&#39;s foot into the air suddenly, sweeping the other out from under him. The last one hit the ground as hard as his fellows, and the victor walked slowly over to the one who stole his gold. <BR> <BR>The old man had platinum hair, brushed back and seemed to be strictly kept after. His sideburns ran down into a light beard and mustache, kept very short. He had bright blue eyes that seemed to peer deeply into everything he gazed at. <BR> <BR>Slowly, he lifted his lost goods from the man&#39;s grasp, and turned back to the kids with a calm, &#34;Sorry for the trouble, and it seems I got your food dirty in my zeal.&#34; <BR> <BR>He opened the bag, looking inside as the brother realized that he did have a little dirt on his food now, as did his sister&#39;s. Not like they had not eaten food with dirt on it before, or worse... <BR> <BR>His mind snapped back as the man lowered to a knee in front of them, outstretching his clinched hand, fist down, as if offering something. The boy stuck his hand out, slightly confused. The sounds of clinking coins entered his mind as he dropped the very bag he had fought for into the child&#39;s palm. <BR> <BR>&#34;This should be enough. I do so apologize, I abhor dueling in the presence of innocence, and beautiful young ladies.&#34; <BR> <BR>He smiled towards the sister, who ignored him. She was staring at the bag of coins, slack jawed. <BR> <BR>With a slight chuckle, he added, &#34;Take with you tidings of a good day, my friends.&#34; <BR> <BR>He stood slowly, marching off between the fallen men. Now the children realized that a small crowd of about eight people stood there, watching the man waltz off. The boy handed his food to his sister, and counted the gold immediately. It sure was a heavy bag. <BR> <BR>&#34;57...gold pieces...&#34; The boy splurged with a breathless anxiety. <BR> <BR>His sister had probably never seen that much money in one place in her lifetime, but now, the boy wondered if he even had. <BR> <BR>Later...Outside the city gates... <BR> <BR>&#34;So, this is the stadium of Joxipo...&#34;, the young man spoke to himself, &#34;We are going to own this tournament...&#34; <BR> <BR>The man stared at the stadium entrance, almost with disdain. The fact he had to fight in this lowly match still irked him, but they needed the money for the new gadget he&#39;d found. Either way, this should be easy pickings for a trainer like him. <BR> <BR>His shirt was a bright green and long sleeved. He held both hands on his hips, just above his blue jeans. He snorted, tossing his head back a bit, bouncing his brown, curly hair. He wasn&#39;t terribly buff, but seemed to have an aura of self worth that no one could penetrate. <BR> <BR>&#34;What do you think?&#34; He asked, scratching the side of his head as he gazed over the opposite shoulder. <BR> <BR>The Gali&#39;s mask went upside down for a moment, then bobbed lightly. The trainer smiled. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, they are all going down.&#34; <BR> <BR>Suddenly, the Gali&#39;s head spun upright, and began smoking slightly. The man was a little perplexed, but then traced his gaze to the source of the anger. <BR> <BR>Entering the stadium, was a young man and a monster. The man couldn&#39;t be much older than he was, and only slightly taller. He held an almost gothic persona, with a long sleeve, light blue shirt. He had his hands in his pockets, up to his spiked wrist bands. Three, small, dangling earrings danced on his left ear, but he couldn&#39;t see if the right held piercings as well. His long, black pants made his legs seem exceptionally lengthy, and they were only slightly lighter in tone than his nearly jet black hair, which was spiked back. He had a look of uninterest in his dark blue eyes, and his pale skin seemed to amplify this severe lack of excitement. <BR> <BR>Yet, it was not the man that pestered his Gali so, it was his monster. The mortal enemy of the Gali race. <BR> <BR>It was a Blue Terror. A Joker. <BR> <BR>The emotionless man felt all too coy in cities, regardless of size. The only company he preferred was that of his monsters. However, these journeys had to be made, to continue his path he would need to win lots of theses things. He didn&#39;t really mind monsters as much as humans. Humans, after all, always have an agenda... <BR> <BR>His thoughts evacuated as a hand landed on his shoulder with a solid grasp. He spun quickly, more scared than surprised. His eyes trained into the gaze of the other man, smiling with the look of a human. The look of an agenda... <BR> <BR>&#34;So, you going to enter that Joker in the tournament today, right?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;He is already entered.&#34; The pale man answered, taking notice of the very agitated Gali. <BR> <BR>Noticing the grip on his monster&#39;s scythe tighten, the man stared harshly at his monster, &#34;Not here, Sleet.&#34; <BR> <BR>The scratched and beaten scythe fell limply to the monster&#39;s side, obedient to his master. <BR> <BR>&#34;Sleet? Might I say, very creative on your part for the name, &#34; He chuckled a bit, adding, &#34;If not plain humorous.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What do you want?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh, how rude of me. Where did I place my manners this morning...&#34; He outstretched a hand towards the weary trainer, &#34;My name is James Nottap. I&#39;ll also be entering this tournament.&#34; <BR> <BR>The man slowly grasped James&#39;s hand, and in return answered, &#34;Frost.&#34; <BR> <BR>It was all James could do to keep the laughter inside, and Frost knew it. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh. Well, that explains the name Sleet. This is Galiant, my Gali. My most powerful monster to date!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;And you spoke something harsh of my monster&#39;s name...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Ok, look, we are getting off on the wrong foot here.&#34; James spoke lightly, both hands in front of him, as his Gali still fumed, &#34;I was just checking a bit of the competition, that&#39;s all.&#34; <BR> <BR>The man said nothing as he turned away, continuing into the coliseum. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh, and Frost,&#34; James&#39;s yelled up the steps to him. <BR> <BR>As Frost turned, James&#39;s added, &#34;If Galiant has to fight Sleet, he will kill him.&#34; <BR> <BR>Frost could only stare at the smiling man in green, wondering if he should let them fight then and there. In the end, he turned from the grinning man, and continued into the stadium. He&#39;d have to shut him up during the matches. <BR> <BR>James smiled towards his Gali, &#34;Like I said...own...&#34; <BR> <BR>Later...Outside the city walls... <BR> <BR>&#34;Well Garu, another day, another tournament. Let&#39;s go.&#34; <BR> <BR>The man strolled through the city gate very casually, his faithful Garu was on all fours behind him. The man&#39;s long black hair came down to the middle of his shoulders, and each swing of his arms seemed to brush it to the opposite side. His dark leather jacket was open, exposing the flaming skull that resided on the chest of his black shirt. His gray eyes pierced each side of the crowded streets. For such a small town, they sure were busy. <BR> <BR>The Garu playfully latched onto his trainer&#39;s blue jeans, but a stern look from the master made him let go. The Garu followed onward on his hind legs, trying to stand as tall and proud as he could, wondering how many people were gazing at him with awe and wonder. <BR> <BR>The grinning Garu bumped into his trainer&#39;s leg, and fell down, completely oblivious to the fact he stopped. He traced his master&#39;s vision onto what seemed to be an item store, and someone making a purchase. <BR> <BR>A man of average height and build slid a bag across the counter, no doubt money. He had dark hair that was spiked strait up, wearing a pair of baggy jeans and a black shirt, he didn&#39;t appear to be anything special. Then he received something from the owner. <BR> <BR>&#34;That man is purchasing Nageel.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Garu held one finger to his mouth in question as he stared at the desk. <BR> <BR>&#34;No, you wouldn&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never used drugs on you, but those are an enhancing item, which means he is a trainer. He is also fighting today, no doubt.&#34; <BR> <BR>The young man placed his Nageel in a bag, and thanked the lady in a proper fashion. As he turned, a burly man with long black hair stood before him, followed by a very curious looking Garu. <BR> <BR>&#34;You using that soon?&#34; <BR> <BR>The younger man, slightly baffled, sharply spat, &#34;Who cares to know?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;My name is Deis. I&#39;m a trainer. This is Garu, the monster I entered into the tournament today.&#34; <BR> <BR>The man stared at Deis, then at his Garu, slightly untrusting of the pair. <BR> <BR>Almost reluctantly, he finally spoke, &#34;You can call me Jared. I&#39;m also entering the tournament today.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;So you intend on giving your monster drugs to win?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Actually, yes, it is part of my training method. Only for my younger monsters, to give them a boost up into their prime.&#34; <BR> <BR>Deis frowned a bit, &#34;So you pollute the body of you monsters at youth, forever impairing them.&#34; <BR> <BR>Jared&#39;s eyes opened wide, and his mouth went into a small, stretch circle as he whistled to himself, then added, &#34;I see, you are on of those types.&#34; <BR> <BR>Deis&#39;s eyes narrowed as he echoed, &#34;Those types?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, you know, the dumb types.&#34; <BR> <BR>Deis&#39;s Garu curled his lips back to form a full snarl, but a wave of Deis&#39;s hand quickly sent the Garu hiding behind its master&#39;s jeans, peering out at the one called Jared. <BR> <BR>&#34;Let me enlighten you. &#34; Jared spoke lightly, &#34;This Nageel isn&#39;t like a drug that causes enough stress on the body to make a monster permanently addicted, nor does it shorten their lives, as the fable goes. This Nageel is an all natural enhancer, with only mild side effects the following day. No long term problems.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;How do you know this?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You think this is the first time I used it?&#34; <BR> <BR>Deis&#39;s brow bundled, then he began to walk away, adding, &#34;We will see which is stronger. Your medicine, or my training.&#34; <BR> <BR>Jared gave a two finger salute from his left eye, also tossing towards the man and his Garu, &#34;I suppose so, Deis.&#34; <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...At the local tavern... <BR> <BR>&#34;Scotch.&#34; The large, red headed man said as he slammed two coins on the counter. <BR> <BR>The bartender nodded politely, and turned for the drink order. Several patrons were gazing at the bar, where the titan sat alone. Well over six feet in height, he was big, burly, and in every way a giant compared to the rest of them. He ran his hand through his short, red hair, pulling it along his sideburns and into his bushy, crimson beard. He wore some brand of pants that were a dingy white, or maybe an extremely light yellow. His shirt was gray, with the sleeves cut off, and had several, small blood stains on the back of it. He was sweaty at the moment, what he had been doing to get so worked was unknown to the guests in this pub, but most could guess on a tournament day. <BR> <BR>The medium sized glass slid slowly across the counter, and the large man smiled as he grasped the cool glass. The bartender even stopped midway through polishing a shot glass to gaze in awe as this customer downed the entire drink. Planting the empty container firmly into the wooden bar, he closed his eyes tight, twisting his head slightly. <BR> <BR>With a rough shake, he smiled once more, with a satisfied sigh ensuing. The bartender thought he heard wrong, but the man had gleefully repeated, &#34;Scotch...&#34; <BR> <BR>Slowly, a new figure entered the bar, one that grabbed everyone&#39;s attention, to include the current drinking champion. <BR> <BR>By the silhouette, you automatically recognized the female qualities. Slowly, she made her way up to the bar. Five seats remained open to the red headed man&#39;s left, and four to his right. She walked like the world was watching, and she was going to impress it. She strolled up to a seat, and placed herself in it, only a mere bar stool away from the man downing his second drink. <BR> <BR>&#34;Tell me barkeep, do you carry white wine?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Um, well, of course.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Then, lets break open a bottle, shall we?&#34; She giggled lightly, &#34;It is a time to celebrate.&#34; <BR> <BR>The man sat his glass on the bar top once more, empty again. His vision fell to the lady beside him. Her brunette hair reached to bar stool she sat on, and he found her lovely green eyes were peering into his. She was smiling coyly, pressing the back of her left fingers against her pale cheek. Her white pants had golden studs running down the side of each leg, down to her spotless white pumps and up to a brown leather belt on her waist. A blindingly white jacket fit the attire well, but then he noticed that the only thing underneath it was, at best, a white bathing suit top. Her jacket was undone in the front, he guessed she usually showed off her amazing genetics. Two things stood out in the whiteness that encompassed her. One was her full, red lips. Second, was a crimson amulet around her neck, easily as bright as her lovely lips were. It was resided slightly above her cleavage, and seemed to be cut of some fine gemstone or another. <BR> <BR>In his buzzed state, he continued to stare at it. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, I suppose you aren&#39;t the shy type, now are you?&#34; As she pulled her jacket around her, giggling playfully. <BR> <BR>The man just stared at her. What a vision. Right now though, he was still drinking off the pain of a good days training, and decided he didn&#39;t want to bother with such a woman. <BR> <BR>&#34;Barkeep, one more Scotch.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Coming right up, Sir.&#34; <BR> <BR>The bartender slid the lady a smaller glass of wine, then proceeded to procure another brew for her counterpart. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, big guy, you got a name?&#34; She asked, releasing her jacket and bringing the glass to her full, red lips. <BR> <BR>The man almost grunted the response, &#34;Dowle.&#34; <BR> <BR>She chuckled slightly, pressing one hand to her lips, the other lowered the glass to the counter, &#34;I&#39;ve heard of you.&#34; <BR> <BR>The large man raised an eyebrow, cocking his head towards what seemed like a compliment, &#34;Really now? <BR> <BR>She noticed now that his right eye held a slight red tint, but his left seemed to pass through her, and always had to turn his head far enough for his right eye to catch her in its field of vision. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, the Crimson Cyclopes is true?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I can still see out of my left eye, but just outlines. It is an implant, after all. I didn&#39;t want something just for decoration.&#34; <BR> <BR>His voice was very rough sounding, and very gritty. She smiled again as the bartender didn&#39;t even release the glass&#39;s handle before Dowle had taken it up himself. As he sat his third empty Scotch on the table, he glanced to his left, staring coldly at this new conversationalist with one raised eyebrow. <BR> <BR>&#34;And who are you?&#34; The gruff, booming voice questioned. <BR> <BR>&#34;My name is Kaytelyn. Most people just call me Kayte, &#34; She smiled to him again as she added, &#34;Or champion.&#34; <BR> <BR>His eyebrows switched locations. As one lowered, the other rose. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, you&#39;re a trainer?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, and I just needed a quick drink to warm me up. Apparently, we share a strategy.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sorry, little lady.&#34; Dowle spoke laying both arms on the bar, starring into his fists, &#34;You ain&#39;t going to win this one.&#34; <BR> <BR>She laughed, loudly this time, &#34;So, the Crimson Cyclopes is going to be victorious?&#34; <BR> <BR>His neck pivoted ever so slowly, and stopped when it faced her completely. <BR> <BR>With this, she added, &#34;I know your reputation, and how your monsters all run in fear or you overworked them to death. Such brutal tactics were outlawed for reasons just like you.&#34; <BR> <BR>She finished her wine with a quick tip of the glass, &#34;I have to go check on my monster. Ta-taa!&#34; <BR> <BR>She laughed again as she exited the bar, looking over her shoulder and flipping her left hand playfully towards the stone faced titan. <BR> <BR>As the door shut, he glanced back to the barkeep with a long stare, then spoke lowly, &#34;Scotch...&#34; <BR> <BR>The bartender resumed his usual task, and was the only one in the tavern that managed to hear Dowle whisper wo himself, &#34;Things change...&#34; <BR> <BR>Meanwhile...at the stadium stables... <BR> <BR>The tench coat flapped behind him as the man in black went down the stair case. He was walking towards the door labeled &#39;Waiting Area&#39;, when a familiar voice pierced the solitude. <BR> <BR>&#34;Erik...Van...Krissler...&#34; <BR> <BR>The voice was very sturdy, very powerful, and seemed to carry a lot of weight. Like a business man with a sales pitch, it demanded attention from all that heard its call. <BR> <BR>The older man stopped, and turned slowly, running his right hand through his platinum hair, &#34;What ever reason could a man named Kilogel want to seek my council?&#34; <BR> <BR>A man in a brownish business suit slowly made his way down the stairs. He was a fairly stout man, with a shaved bald head. He held the front of his jacket with both hands, like a man with an offer. His brown leather shoes slapped the ground with light plops as he finished his decent. Standing about the same height, he was equally as buff looking as the man called Krissler. His smile, however convincing as it was, was venomous to the ears. <BR> <BR>&#34;I seek no council, old friend. I saw the scuffle you had earlier, and I&#39;m glad to see you haven&#39;t lost your touch from the glorious days of the military.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Keep your Devil&#39;s Tongue under lock and key, and speak straight if you want something accomplished in this re-acquaintance.&#34; The man in black spoke. <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t think you are so wise, Van Krissler, you aren&#39;t that much older than me. You only seem such.&#34; The smile of a jester poured onto his face, with a lighthearted, almost earnest chuckle. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, at least I can say, &#34; Erik stopped momentarily, &#34;It is good to see you.&#34; <BR> <BR>With a quick smile and and handshake, Kilogel pulled his friend into a tight hug. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes indeed, Erik. Glad to see you are well.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What brings you to the rundown little city of Joxipo?&#34; <BR> <BR>The man pulled on the front of his jacket once more, pushing his chest out like a true salesman, &#34;Why, I entered the tournament.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, some good old fashion competition never hurt anyone.&#34; The man in black laughed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, that is the thing, Erik, I do have a proposition.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Somehow, I knew you would, Kilogel.&#34; Krissler spoke with a slight smile. <BR> <BR>&#34;There is a ton of money in this tournament, and Erik...&#34; The business man leaned forward, &#34;I can cut you a percentage.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, stop spouting around the subject and talk numbers.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No less than thirty percent for an old friend.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What do you want done?&#34; Krissler asked, placing his hands back into his pockets. <BR> <BR>&#34;Frankly, you are number one on the favored list. People are betting on you the most.&#34; He glanced over his shoulder, scanning the area for other persons before he continued, &#34;My monster is going to be the last entered, and the least bet on, if anyone bets on at all. Yet, it can easily over power the rest of these amateurs. But you, you are something to be reckoned with.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You want me to throw the fight, Kilogel?&#34; Erik spoke, bobbing his head with an expression of dullness. <BR> <BR>&#34;Not anything so fancy, or obvious. I just want you to withdraw for our match. Depending on the setup, you can fight the rest of the tournament, but if our monsters cross, you forfeit.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What is in it for me again?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll raise it to thirty five percent, easily more money than you can imagine right now. I&#39;ll win the tournament, and collect all the lost bets for the other competitors, being the only one to bet on my monster. The bet money is pooled, and since my monster will be the last in, he&#39;ll the most underrated. His power his amazing though, and can easily smash the others. All the money, plus the cash prize. We can total it all up and split the percentage there.&#34; <BR> <BR>With a slight wave of his hand, and a shake of his head, Erik answered simply, &#34;I&#39;m out of these shady deals, Kilogel, remember?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You were never out, old friend, only temporarily released.&#34; Kilogel leaned forward again, &#34;You can&#39;t get out of the darker parts of your life, you know that. This is what you do, this is how you operate, Mr. Nobility. This is money, this is success. This is true power.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;This is wrong.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Wrong? How?!&#34; Kilogel exclaimed, extending his arms in both directions with a stupefied look on his face, &#34;How is this more wrong than some other deals you&#39;ve made?&#34; <BR> <BR>Kilogel found his collar knotted around two clenched fists in the next instant. His back planted firmly against the wall beside the staircase. Erik was mere inches from his face now. <BR> <BR>&#34;I know I can&#39;t forget or outrun the past, but I&#39;ve accepted the things I&#39;ve done. I&#39;ve moved on, and don&#39;t you dare come here and dangle those regrets before my eyes. I escaped my guilt long ago!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Did you, Krissler?! Did you honestly forgive yourself and forget the deals, the bets, the gambles? Did you gain the forgiveness from her family? Or her friends? But you seriously forgave yourself?!&#34; <BR> <BR>The grip loosened, and Erik turned in disgust. Kilogel patted his suit down a bit, tugging on his jacket while adding, &#34;You can&#39;t escape. You never did.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Leave before I kill you.&#34; The man in black whispered under his breath. <BR> <BR>&#34;And add another regret to you belt?&#34; Kilogel snickered, &#34;I fail to see what is so wrong about this deal. It is far from the worst you&#39;ve undertaken.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What about honor?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;What is more honorable than being superior to others, enough that you have to botch a fight to keep from winning?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That isn&#39;t honor, and you know it.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Not by you, Erik, but who goes by your ideas of it anyway?&#34; <BR> <BR>He turned slowly, staring coldly into Kilogel&#39;s eyes, &#34;I do.&#34; <BR> <BR>The man in the brown business suit shrugged, patting himself again. <BR> <BR>Staring down and adjusting his green tie, he spoke slowly, &#34;Well, the offer stands. You can continue on this path of poorness and chance in the arena, or you can come back to what you know. Regain your lost fame, your money, you can have everything with us, and you know it.&#34; <BR> <BR>Erik walked towards the door, stopping within arms reach of the knob. Kilogel stared into the back of his one time comrade, curious of what thoughts coursed through that brilliant mind of his. <BR> <BR>With a sound of renewed determination, he finally spoke, &#34;If I&#39;m the favorite, then I can&#39;t disappoint. I just can&#39;t face the shame of forfeiting...&#34; <BR> <BR>He turned sharply, and with a quick pace, was right in front of Kilogel&#39;s gaze once more. <BR> <BR>&#34;So, to pull this off, my monster will have to take a dive.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Erik Van Krissler, you&#39;ve made the right choice.&#34; Kilogel outstretched his hand. <BR> <BR>The man in black grasped it tightly, affirming this alliance. <BR> <BR>-Stay Tuned.- CHB <BR> <BR>It is chapter one, so people will start having more dedicated chapters later on. And you can email me if you like with suggestions for your charactors, etc. I&#39;ll evaluated them accordingly. Enjoy. <BR> <BR><A HREF="mailto:King_usaf2003@yahoo.com">King_usaf2003@yahoo.com</A>

<I>Jared&#39;s eyes opened wide, and his mouth went into a small, stretch circle as he whistled to himself, then added, &#34;I see, you are on of those types.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Deis&#39;s eyes narrowed as he echoed, &#34;Those types?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, you know, the dumb types.&#34;</I> <BR> <BR>Nice.

 Excellent. You portrayed all of the characters nicely. Such great descriptions and coming out on top working with other people&#39;s ideas deserves a pat on the back. Nice job!
