 The next few days were a dream to Leo.  The band of monsters that had helped him escape helped him again by burying his master.  They were all huddled inside the living room of Namis&#39;s house warming by a fire that the tiger had managed to light with a thunderbolt.  Leo had not said much over the past three days but it was on the afternoon of the third day that he began to come to terms with the fact that his master was gone forever.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Thankyou…&#34; Leo broke the silence of the living room.  The other monsters looked to each other and then all looked to the gitan.   <BR> <BR>&#34;You are welcome…listen…we are going to suggest something which you may not agree with and we perfectly understand if you don’t want to but I think it would severely benefit you if you did…&#34; Said the gitan. <BR> <BR>&#34;Who were they?&#34; Leo said without raising his eyes from the fire sending smoke up the chimney pipes and into the rainy afternoon air.  <BR> <BR>&#34;The man is named Lord Wolfgang Restivis. He is a murderous brute and deserves to be killed.  The dragon that was with him is named Pyros.&#34; The stinger hissed. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why did the want me and what is the crusade?&#34; Leo said, still with his eyes on the flames. <BR> <BR>&#34;The crusade is what Wolfgang wants more than any other thing in the world.  He is…He has a disk, it has been inscribed with…&#34; The gitan explained.  <BR> <BR>&#34;The picture? I saw it.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes well he thinks it is depicting his destiny and though I hate to admit it, there is a possibility.  The crusade is how he hopes to achieve this.  Wolfgang hopes to rule ALL monsters.  Think about it. Not all wild monsters or all trained monsters not even all dragons, durahans, suezos or momos. ALL monsters.  We are not sure how he is doing it but slowly he is actually starting to accomplish this.  You see us monsters are tribal creatures.  Every time he recruits a tiger, the whole pack are likely to join.  Once one wild monster is recruited it is easy to recruit another and eventually a whole area of monsters are working for him.  We can&#39;t let him get away with this.&#34;  The gitan continued. <BR> <BR>&#34;Who is we?&#34; Leo said finally pulling his eyes away from the fire now it had died down to just a few glowing embers. <BR> <BR>&#34;My name is Shadow,&#34; said the gitan looking sympathetically to the monster. &#34;These are Vorlante,&#34; he motioned to the naga. &#34;Orb&#34; he motioned to the psiroller. &#34;And Jackal.&#34; The tiger gave a small nod of recognition.  &#34;We want to stop him.  Don’t think we are the only ones who know of Wolfgang but we are just as important as anyone else.  Both FIMBA and AGE are onto Wolfgang and if they knew where he kept himself they could possibly find proof of his crimes.&#34; Shadow growled. <BR> <BR>&#34;I see, and now you want me to join your team because just like everyone else, you have false hope in me.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;The hope is not false you fool!&#34; Growled Jackal who Leo suddenly realised he had not heard speak since the day of Namis&#39;s departure. &#34;We need you just like he does.  You are a powerful monster indeed, you have proved that.  You are powerful statistically, tactical and know when to act.&#34;    <BR> <BR>Just as the words were said there was a blast of glass as the windows on either side of the room burst inwards.  Shards of wood and glass flew past the monsters who all instinctively readied themselves for battle.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Who is there!&#34; yelled Orb &#34;Whoever you are I suggest you leave now!&#34; <BR> <BR>There was a small explosion on one side of the house and the whole building shook with damage. Dust fell from the rafters and a few loose bricks came racketing down the chimney landing in the dust of the fireplace.  There was a high-pitched roar from outside and four monsters jumped in through the broken windows.  They were all zuums, three regular green ones and a single crab zuum.   <BR>They all instantly drove towards the group of monsters.  A single zuum was concentrating on Leo.  He swung his tail to try and whip Leo in the face but it missed and pulled a handful of pictures of f of the mantle piece and they smashed on the brick floor.  Leo drew his claws and shot three blasts of lightning at the zuum.  It shied away a little then launched itself again and caught Leo&#39;s leg in its mighty jaws. Leo let out a yelp and the zuum laughed before tossing him in the air and launching a series of fireballs at him. They all missed and Leo manoeuvred so he landed on his feet and jumped on to the lizards scaled back.  He then pictured lightning running through his blood and was surrounded by blue light.  The zuum fell defeated to the floor and faded away. Leo turned to see the remaining three being dispatched by his new teammates. Orb charged horn first into the crab zuum, sending him careering into the wall and faded away. Shadow and Vorlante were disposing of the final zuum who was trying to find his way blindly to a window amongst a storm of slashing claws.  He slowed down and fell to the floor before fading away.   Orb rolled over to the window and looked out. <BR> <BR>&#34;Nothing else, I think that they must have shook the house with fireballs or something&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;It is not important, Wolfgang knows we are here, this is a place of little strategic advantage, I think it is time we moved on.&#34; The creatures long , clawed ears swayed as he turned to face Leo.  &#34;So, are you going to join us?&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes. Let us find somewhere safer.&#34; Leo commanded.  <BR> <BR>There was a halfhearted cheer from the others and they leapt through the window into the now sunny day. They headed for the town.  It was the nearest place to gain supplies and such and if they were going to search for Wolfgang they would need supplies more than anything else other than luck.  It was amazing how good Leo felt. Only an hour ago he had still been wishing he was dead, now he actually felt really happy.  Partly due to letting go of his masters death, partly due to the joy of having new friends, partly due to the jokes that his new friends were making as they walked and also, maybe, due to the way he felt he was off to get revenge.  Before they were even a mile away from the town they could see something was wrong.   Vorlante saw it first and let out an angry hiss/growl.  The town was a mass of commotion. <BR> <BR>  People were running in all directions and screaming danced on the air even from so far away. Within seconds they were all running towards the town.  As they reached its borders a family of four ran past them screaming a lost child&#39;s name.  They ran deeper into the town, passing more and more groups, pairs and singular people, some with monsters, running in various directions trying to escape.  Leo was at the front of the group when they reached to town centre.  The area was swimming with monsters, they weren’t the monsters of fleeing people though, Leo had a good idea that these were what the people were fleeing from.  Each monster bore a small symbol, a black diamond, somewhere on their body.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Lets break up this little party!&#34; Hissed Vorlante before slithering over to the nearest monster, an arrowhead of some type who was repeatedly launching his stinger into a wooden door.  From within there came shrieks and cries of children and the quietening voices of adults. The arrowhead paused as the muscular body of the serpent approached him, and pulled his sting from the battered doorway.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Who are you? And why are….&#34; The creatures clicking voice rung out before Vorlante plunged his claws deep into his underside, and pulled the underbelly of the creature out so that his insides fell to the ground.  Vorlante claws the door open and shouted for the family to move out.  They screamed and reacted with great fear before realising he was not one of the arrowheads teammates, at which point they thanked him quickly and ran.  <BR> <BR>The naga&#39;s attack had prompted a fair bit of attention to the party and it seemed that the, diamond wearing monsters instinctively knew they were not part of their group. A circle of various monsters enclosed around them.  Leo was about to attack the nearest creature, a deep green moochi, when a large burst of sound cut him off.  He looked into the air, as did the other four of the team.  Above them was the underbelly of a great purple dragon, with a long cut going diagonally across.  The dragon let loose another blast of sound and Leo could see all the monsters in the town centre look upwards. Jackal took the opportunity to launch a thunder attack at a monol floating nearby but it retaliated with a charge attack and the tiger backed down.  The dragon landed just outside the circle of monsters surrounding the group, and on his back was Wolfgang.  There was a single speck of blood adorning his pristine white cloak. Leo knew it had belonged to his master only three days ago.  Wolfgang smiled as he leapt off the creatures back, allowing it to stand upright.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Well look who I found! Not so confident when you’re the ones outnumbered are you?&#34; He smiled and glared at the same time leaving a look of sickness on his face. He waited for one of them to speak but none of them did.  &#34;Fine then, lets outbalance the odds a little further eh?&#34; He reached into his t-shirt and Leo noticed there was a small black diamond pinned on his chest.  From inside of the t-shirt Wolfgang pulled a whistle and gave it a single, long blow.   <BR> <BR>The town centre was circular in shape.  There was a fountain in the very middle of it and three roads led to and from the rest of the town, which in turn had roads leading to outside of the town.  It was down these three roads that a carpet of monsters came charging.  A sea of black diamonds was coming towards the circle of monsters guarding the group&#39;s escape.  <BR> <BR>&#34;He must have his entire force here!&#34; whispered Orb.  Somehow Wolfgang over heard him and smiled lightly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Not at all.&#34; He said.  &#34;The majority of my forces are positioned on the outside of the town, mowing down the families that are running away from my forces here.&#34; <BR> <BR>All five of the monsters growled in shock and horror, a few snickers arose from the crowd of monsters surrounding them.  Wolfgang smiled himself then motioned for silence.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Now my friends.  You have witnessed the bare power of my forces, are you willing to join or am I going to have to take you by force?&#34; There was a pause as none of them spoke. &#34;Perhaps persuasion would be the best tactic. Proof of how we can make you stronger.&#34; He turned from the group to face the crowd of black diamond monsters. &#34;Monol squad! Cage attack!&#34; He roared. <BR> <BR>About thirty monols floated into the air.  They got into groups of six making five groups altogether.  Five of the monols in each group made themselves into boxes with one side open whilst the other one waited for the monster to be forced inside so that they could close them in.   <BR> <BR>&#34;There is no point in fighting you are surrounded!&#34; Wolfgang said triumphantly and Leo knew he was right.  He allowed himself to be places inside the box by a regular moochi wearing his diamond in the centre of his forehead.  Four of the five boxes were filled when the last of the team went to get in.  Just by chance it happened to be Jackal and in the spirit of tigers, he refused to give up.  He went to get into the box then leapt.  He landed on top of the monols and then jumped again, chaos erupted as all the monsters tried to get him but he dodged left and right and ran up walls until he got to the very edge.  Pyros swung a heavy claw and even breathed a jet of fire but both missed the speeding tiger.  Jackal skipped around a corner, down a street and disappeared. <BR> <BR>&#34;Foolish tiger! He will not be given the chance you are to receive.&#34; Wolfgang said as the boxes began to float towards the outer borders of the town.  Leo was trapped in pure darkness surrounded by soft monol tissue, he knew he could easily attack them but he was aware of the crowd escorting the monol boxes to wherever he was being taken.  He expected it to be a vehicle of some type for transport but it could be anywhere.  There was a sudden blast of sound and the monsters around Leos box began shouting and yelling orders.  From within his box he could see nothing but he knew that whatever was happening was a welcome advantage that he would be hard pressed to get again.  He was about to electrocute the surrounding domino shaped with his claws when the one above him shook as if being used as if it was in a high wind, then flew off exposing a large gap in the box.  Leo jumped out and tried to run but also take in his surroundings.  What he saw was not what he had expected.  He expected that Jackal had been foolish enough to return and the monsters were all trying to get him, or that a few of the town folk were putting up a fight.  <BR> <BR>What in fact lay before him was an army. Not the Black Diamond army but a completely different one. Rows upon rows of hengar were pouring from the three streets leading to the town centre.  The Black Diamond monsters were falling left, right and centre under the lazers and other high tech weaponry of the monsters.  Leo ran up and placed his hand on the shoulder of a nearby mew, before plunging a claw deep into its stomach and the creature faded before his eyes.  Behind him he heard Orb shouting something but the words were lost under the shouts of the Black Diamond army.  As if from no where Jackal appeared and began attacking another tiger, Orb was behind him inflating and deflating the wheel on which he sat to hit the monsters surrounding him, Shadow had also escaped and was breathing streams of fire at a small circle of three tigers that were trying to bit him into submission.  The Naga was nowhere to be seen but he presumed it had quickly disposed of everything that had gotten in its way.  Leo still found it hard to comprehend how Vorlante could be so good and friendly yet still attack with the violence and force of an evil naga. Meanwhile the army was still sending bolts of lazer, bombs and thin yellow beams into the monsters.  Leo ran from group to group looking for Wolfgang.  He had not seen him since he had sealed him within the box and was eager to know where he was hiding.  On cue Wolfgang swooped down from above the clouds on the back of his prized dragon. He flew over the hengar army and launched a stream of molten rock that singed a long line of soldiers.  <BR> <BR>&#34;GARLANT FACTION ATTACK!&#34; Yelled a human voice from behind the wall of robots.  From the crowd a group of red, hover bots floated into the air, flew to the front of the group and unfolded into full-bodied hengar.   <BR> <BR>&#34;PYROSPHERE!&#34; Yelled the voice again and the hengars acted in complete unison in the way only robots and trained soldiers can.   <BR> <BR>A screen covering the mouth of each robot slowly slid down to reveal a thin slit into the robots inner workings.  A small spark appeard at the mouth of each robot before growing into a large sphere of red lightning which went rocketing away.  When they made contact the balls exploded and Leo guessed that the robots were ignorant of their whereabouts.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Hey Leo, you coming?&#34; Shout Jackal from somewhere to Leo&#39;s left.  Jackal and the others were waiting at a sewer entrance, which, by the look of the deep claw marks on the lid, had been removed by Vorlante.  Leo ran over and leapt down the dark tube into nothingness and still the sounds of fighting could be heard above.
