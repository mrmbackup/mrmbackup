 Draine stared out into the frozen landscape of Brilla. Most viewed this place as a lonely wasteland of snow that stretched out for mile upon countless mile. But  Draine and his people, the Zans, saw something more. They saw home. <BR>       <BR>Long ago, as the cities of the planet became more advanced and began to grow, his ancestors chose a quieter life. They outcast themselves from society and made a small village in the barren snowfeild Draine now looked upon. Because of his predecessor&#39;s decision, most of the Zans had little contact to the outside world except maybe the occasional nomadic Baku. Thus most of the Zans were purebreed. Draine, chief of his people, was not. <BR>        <BR>Draine was a Guy, an awsome mix of Zan and Ripper. In his village none could match his blinding speed. Everyone looked up to him. He was a born leader and had never in his life made a bad decision. He was in amazing health considering his age, he was the oldest Zan to ever live, but he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that he didn&#39;t have much longer to live. This feeling was at its strongest, so he had come to his &#34;thinking spot&#34; to ponder his replacement. <BR>         <BR>The chief&#39;s &#34;thinking spot&#34; was a small crevice under one of Brilla&#39;s many overhanging cliffs. The cliff was the last of the largest chain in Brilla which they called the Great Cliffs. Afterward all that stretched on for miles was lifeless snow plains. Located miles from the village, the hike there would take multiple hours for other monsters. It took Draine less than ten minutes. <BR>         Suddenly the feeling of doom became unbearable for the Guy. He stared a cold stare into the stary sky. This seemed to be the feeling&#39;s focal point. Then soemthing happened that hadn&#39;t happened for years. The watch tower&#39;s danger alarm sounded. The old Zan raced to the tower with all his speed as two objects tore through the Brilla sky. <BR>                  <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>          <BR>Malt grew bored. Every night he and his freind Tamra stood out on their snow watch tower staring out into empty, lifeless Brilla. It was their job to watch for any danger and sound the alarm. <BR>          <BR>&#34;Why do we have to do this?&#34; Tamra said suddenly. He was a Shin, one of four of the non purebreeds in the village. <BR>          <BR>&#34;I know watch you mean. Nothing ever wanders out this far into the mountians.&#34; Malt replied. &#34;But someone has to do it.&#34; <BR>          <BR>&#34;Well not us. Every night we stand up here and freeze to death while everyone else is asleep in their nice warm huts. It&#39;s someone elses turn.&#34; <BR>          <BR>&#34;You know Draine wouldn&#39;t have picked us for the job if there wasn&#39;t a reason.&#34; Malt tried to calm his friend down. But he only grew angrier. <BR>        &#34;Well let&#39;s see him get up here and-&#34; Tamra felt a slight twinge in his back limbs. Malt felt it too and the night grew silent. Suddenly the temperature began to rise and a bright light filled the sky.&#34;It&#39;s no where near sun-up.&#34; Tarma said. <BR>        <BR>&#34;That&#39;s no sun.&#34; Malt gaped. He was right. The &#34;sun&#34; was hurtling toward them at unimaginable speed. &#34;Better sound the alarm, my friend. I think we&#39;ve go trouble.
