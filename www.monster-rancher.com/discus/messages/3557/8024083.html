 &#34;It looks as if we won&#39;t be seeing any action today,&#34; said Pyrus dully &#34;even though I wish not to see the deaths of my comrades, I just can&#39;t take just waiting around doing nothing.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Patience,&#34;said Canjin &#34;you should be happy. We should head back to base in a&#34; <BR> <BR>However, Canjin was cut off by the battle cries of the Dragons. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hahahahahahahahaha!&#34; screamed Draconis&#34;Petty Katos,  you shall meet your death here! Inferno!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Fall back Tainted Cats!&#34; cried Canjin &#34;Regroup at the top of the hill then Oil Flame them!&#34; <BR> <BR>With that the battle between the two factions erupted. Although the Tainted Cats fought valiantly, they were no match for Draconis and his Dragons. So they could do nothing but flee with their remaining Katos. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>At the Ninja Katos Attack Site <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#34;Fight on my brothers!&#34; screamed Hyoue, however was voice was fading as were his Katos &#34;We must survive until our backup arrives.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter how hard you fight fool!&#34; taunted general Drakan &#34;You have no chance against the army of Deathbringer! Trample! &#34; <BR> <BR>However it was easily dodged by the elite fighter. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ha!&#34; creened Hyoue &#34;Guess you Dragons aren&#39;t as strong as you&#39;d liked to think!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;And we intend to prove that too!&#34; screamed Rathious with his Katos. <BR> <BR>And a look of shock and relief was seen on the face of Hyoue while a look of fear and rage was seen on Drakan. <BR> <BR>&#34;Rathious!&#34; shouted Rathious with a sigh of relief &#34;You have finally decided to come eh? Well lets do this then!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Ummm....&#34; spoke Drakan with a some what mocking tone &#34;Katos defeat Dragons? I think NOT! Flying Combo!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;WHAT!&#34; screamed Hyoue. <BR> <BR>So Hyoue was too distracted to see the attack coming and when he did it was already too late. <BR> <BR>&#34;NO!&#34; shouted Hyoue with a knowing that he was done for &#34;It&#39;s all over. GAH!!!!!!&#34; <BR> <BR>With that Hyoue was hit with a flurry of blows and when the attack was finished Hyoue laid there, motionless. <BR> <BR>&#34;YOU!&#34; screeched Rathious with a rage unknown to him &#34;You will now know the pain that you caused to all of us! Phantom Claw! Phantom Claw! Phantom Claw! Phantom Claw! Phantom Claw! PHANTOM CLAW!&#34;  <BR> <BR>A flurry of furious attacks were let loose on the Dragon elite. <BR> <BR>&#34;WHAT!&#34; groaned Drakan in pain &#34;What is this! Ugh!&#34; <BR> <BR>Then Drakan was no more. Not even a lost disk was left of him. <BR> <BR>Hey, it&#39;s me again. You may not remember me but here I am again, writing my story. I was off the computer for a while and when I got back on, I found out the best site was gone. Anyhow, comments for this story would be appreciated. Cya.
