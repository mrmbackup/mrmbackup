 Chapter 26: The Master Rises <BR> <BR>Long ago, while Moo still retained his humanoid form he appointed 4 generals to lead his army. A Pixie, a Gali, a Naga and finally a Magic. These four would aid him in his quest of domination. Each one was given an objective...and failure was not tolerated. All proved to be reasonably capable...except for Magic, who seemed to fail at even the simplest of tasks. Finally the dark lords patience came to an abrupt end as the monster reported his latest loss... <BR> <BR>&#34;Master Moo,&#34;Magic kneeled low before the dark one; surrounded by his fellow generals, deep within the halls Moo&#39;s terrible fortress. &#34;The humans set an ambush, my forces...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;So you&#39;ve lost again I see,&#34;Gali spoke in his usual condescending tone.&#34;Well, I suppose everything&#39;s perfectly normal then.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Next time I wont fail,&#34;Magic said but to Moo and everyone else it was the same tired song.&#34;Next time I&#39;ll-&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;There will be no next time...&#34; Moo&#39;s devious voice echoed throughout the chamber and all present shuttered in fear. &#34;I can always find another to replace you. Magic, you are a flawed tool and of no use to me.&#34; <BR> <BR>So it came to pass that Magic be punished for his uselessness. Enduring torture upon cruel torture before his battered body was cast from the flying fortress like so much trash. They had been surveying the IMA continent for future invasion plans at that time. Perhaps this too was planned by fate. He awoke after a time, nearly every bone in his body broken, a pool of blood forming beneath him. The surrounding area was nothing more then a waste land, active volcanos and rivers of magma. Magic had already excepted his rapidly approaching demise, welcoming any release from the pain. Time passed...and his fevered dreams were shattered by a sound...no, a voice. Despite the fact that he could not understand it&#39;s words Magic was drawn to the voice, dragging a battered body along the ground with his fleeting last bits of strength. The voice urged him toward a strange volcano, veins of black metal lining it&#39;s base. He attempted to stand but couldn&#39;t and fell to the side...and kept falling. Magic had stumbled into an unseen crevice and rolled downward into the depths. With a sick thud he hit the ground and found himself engulfed by darkness. <BR> <BR>~I...hatred...vengence...Become one...~ <BR> <BR>The voice sounded clearer, though it came to his mind as an incoherent string of meaningless words. Well, perhaps not totally without meaning. Revenge was something that Magic did indeed crave... <BR> <BR>~I...your hatred...Vengence...you seek...Become one with...Forever!~ <BR> <BR>It began to make more sense, though he still had no idea what this unseen entity wanted... <BR> <BR>~I sense your hatred, Vengence is what you seek. Become one with me...and you shall be Forever!~ <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Moo saw these images in his minds eye as his nemesis finally revealed it&#39;s identity. The dragon had all but forgotten the Magic, never would he have imagined that worthless fool not merely surviving...but amassing such power. Even now the Master demonstrated it, effortlessly holding Moo&#39;s mass three full feet from the floor. For a time, Master and weakling regarded each other, though now the roles had been reversed. Now it was Moo whom stood at the mercy of his former general. Perhaps a lesser monster would have surrendered at this point...Moo merely laughed. <BR> <BR>~You dare mock me!?~The mental voice of the Master echoed through his mind. The freaks tendrils drew tighter around his limbs but still, Moo showed no fear. <BR> <BR>&#34;Indeed...because you are STILL a flawed tool!&#34;With that crimson flames burst from the throat of Moo and washed over the Master. His enemy let loose a horrible mental scream and released him, tendrils flailing uncontrollably. The scream reverberated though Moo&#39;s skull, causing great pain...but through the anguish he grinned. This at least proved the &#39;Master&#39; was hardly immortal, it could be killed...and Moo intended to tear it apart. Before the Master could counterattack the dragon lunged forward, flames pouring from his maw, talons seeking to rend the flesh of his enemy. Yet his claws were repelled by the Masters armor and the flames had only minimal effect... <BR> <BR>&#34;Uurrggh!&#34;Moo roared as his enemy launched a tendril straight through his shoulder, piercing bone and flesh alike. Through the pain Moo hardly noticed as another tendril encircled his tail while more still ensnared his legs. With a firm pull the dragon was brought crashing down... <BR> <BR>Moo was furious...he tried to stand but the Master had a vise grip on him. Then the dark lord did something strange...his tendrils began to change shape and density, becoming spearlike blades. Moo could guess what happened next, but could do nothing to avoid it. Anguish shot through his body as the blade/tendrils speared his limbs. They tore past skin, rended muscle and shattered bone to reach the floor, where they became embedded. Blood flowed freely as the great dragon was effectively pinned to the floor, helpless, utterly at the mercy of the Master. It was here...for a single moment that Moo realized fear and hopelessness. The tendriled visage of the dark Master hovered over him now..and Moo saw not only his adversary...but the tool of his own demise. <BR> <BR>~How does it feel Moo? To be helpless before me as once I was before you. How things change...~ The Master gloated, superior at last. However, his revenge was not complete, a small glimmer of defiance still shined in the dragons eyes...and it would have to be crushed. ~Not quite humbled yet? I&#39;ll fix tha-Aaarrgggh!~ <BR> <BR>It had been the moment of weakness Moo had waited for. His enemy had grown too confident and let his guard down. Somehow, someway...Moo summoned every bit of strength he still possessed and surged forward, freeing himself and slamming into the Master with a headbutt. The dragons horns sunk deep into the Masters chest and Moo continued the assault, lifting his head and the smashing his enemy to the floor. The Master was down, stunned, his tendrils limp...but Moo gave him no quater. The dragon rained blow after blow onto his fallen adversary, driving him inch after inch into the metallic floor. He then took to the air, straining his wings to stay afloat. Exhaustion was taking it&#39;s toll...he had to end this now. Concentrating his power into his throat Moo unleashed a hellish fireball. The deadly sphere was blazing red with a black center, surrounded by a ring of flame. The ensuing explosion engulfed the entire chamber, forcing Moo to stay airborne or be devoured by his own flame. The fires died down, smoke rose...and the dragon fell. The pain of his wounds had caught up to Moo at last. He felt his limbs growing numb...his mind reeled from loss of blood. Collapsing into a heap he waited to see if the Master survived. He waited...and waited...but nothing emerged from the smoking crater. This was quite fortunate for Moo, as his body was too racked with pain to launch another attack of that power. Even the metal walls and floor had begun to drip and melt, such was the intensity of the dragons fire. <BR> <BR>A moment passed...and Moo felt a strange rumbling beneath him and watched as the floor began to crumble away. He thought it was an illusion at first it was so surreal, the metallic floor shattering with glasslike frailty and breaking into perfect square pieces before hurdling into the chamber below. Through it all the dragon simply hovered, suspended in midair. He stared downward...it looked like the area where the ship drew it&#39;s power, a mess of cables. <BR> <BR>~~Did you think for a moment you had a chance against me Moo!?~~ <BR> <BR>The Master appeared before him and Moo roared, struggling against the invisible bonds that held him. It was futile...and the Master ensnared him again, threatening to pull the dragon limb from limb... <BR> <BR>~~At long last Moo...your reign ends..and mine begins! I-Argghh!~~ <BR> <BR>Moo glanced over and to his surprise he spotted StoneClaw, Ganthor and Shielka standing at the edge. They were launching energy attacks from afar, blasting the Master relentlessly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Took you long enough!&#34;Moo snarled as he grabbed one of the Masters tendrils and twisted his body, ripping the tentacle out. His enemy screamed, caught off guard. This was it, they had to press the attack, keep the evil one disoriented. If he recovered all was lost. Moo struggled savagely...but the Master halted his efforts, sending a surge of energy through his tendrils and electrocuting the dragon. Moo went limp, still conscious but in terrible pain. The Master then simply glanced in the direction of the trio, erecting an energy screen. Their attacks bounced off like nothing...  <BR> <BR>~~Now..where was I. Yes, yes I was about to kill you.~~ The Master taunted, nothing could stop him in this moment of absolute triumph! Or so he thought... <BR> <BR>~~W-what? What do you mean we&#39;re not going to kill him??~~ The Master protested, seemingly speaking to himself. ~~A better host? But...but I was your perfect host. Look how powerful we are together! Not even Moo stands against us!~~ <BR> <BR>The dragon strained to hear the second voice...but couldn&#39;t. He looked over to the others. They seemed to be able to hear what was going on, though he doubted they could sense the second voice either. It seemed the &#39;master&#39; wasn&#39;t the one in charge after all... Suddenly the Master began to twist and writhe in anguish, his skin liquefying. It was reaching out for him...for Moo...seeking to engulf the dragon. As the skin peeled away a Magic could be seen, his former general. He could see tears streaking down the monsters face. This entity...it was the only thing that was keeping the fatally wounded Magic alive... <BR> <BR>&#34;No...don&#39;t leave me! Not for my worst enemy!&#34; He screamed aloud, his mouth uncovered as the ooze began to smother Moo... &#34;I need you! We had a deal! We had &#42;gasp&#42; Ack! Arraggh!&#34; <BR> <BR>The Magic became entirely loosed and tumbled into the chamber below. He was dead long before coming to a meaty thud at the bottom. The energy screen had been dropped as well. Meanwhile the ooze covered the dragons entire body, forming a hideous cocoon. Moo didn&#39;t fight it...not at all. He felt calm, at peace, as though this was meant to happen...his very destiny. The pain from his wounds melted away as a sinister voice invaded his mind... <BR> <BR>~~Become one with me...and you shall be Forever!~~ <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Pain...as a veteran of the arena and a monster in general...Justice the Durahan. But never had it shot through his steel frame as it did now. The old warrior staggered through the darkened halls, eager to reach the others and lend his aid. Every step he took rattled his armor. It was as if every part of him was screaming, pleading with Justice to stop his crusade. He felt his aging body weakening, his legs threatening to give way...and the knight knew deep down he could not continue on like this much longer. <BR> <BR>When he found the others they we&#39;re standing at the edge of a huge hole, leading deeper into the ship. Stoneclaw, Shielka and Ganthor...Celine and beatdown were missing...and where was Moo? Then he saw it...the hideous cocoon pulsating, hovering in the air above the pit. He could see Moo&#39;s tail clearly for a moment before that too, was sucked in. <BR> <BR>&#34;Claw...what&#39;s happened? What is...that?&#34;He asked, it took some effort to speak. The deadly Trident turned to him and shook his head... <BR> <BR>&#34;Your not gonna believe this one old man...&#34;Stoneclaw replied and quickly related the events as best he could. Now, neither monster really understood the situation...but one thing was crystal clear. Whatever was in the cocoon could NOT be allowed to emerge. If this symbiotic...could turn a mere Magic into a being more powerful then the mighty Moo...what would happen if that same creature merged with the dark dragon? Moo&#39;s power would be inconceivable. By joining forces with Moo and coming here they may have made a massive mistake, trading one enemy for an even greater threat... <BR> <BR>&#34;Where&#39;s Celine and Beatdown? We need them...if that cocoon isn&#39;t destroyed we&#39;re finished!&#34; Justice looked around and fortunately spotted Celine as she arrived. The dryad was alone strangely...and seeing this the durahan&#39;s heart sank... &#34;Celine? Where is...&#34; <BR> <BR>He didn&#39;t need to finish...as the dryad burst into tears. &#34;She&#39;s gone justice...&#34; <BR> <BR>Justice hung his helm, clenching his fist in rage. He had always been fond of the little fairy hair, she&#39;d been with them from the beginning. She dissevered more then death in this forsaken place. His feelings seemed echoed by the entire group, a tragic blow. Even stoneclaw seemed struck by news of her death. As the others fell silent the Trident began gathering energy in his hands, turning to the throbbing cocoon above... <BR> <BR>&#34;Well??&#34; He hissed angrily as he unleashed a barrage of energy shots, pummeling the cocoon relentlessly. &#34;Are we going to let that thing hatch and her death be in vain? Lets blast both the Master AND Moo straight to hell!!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Not a chance...&#34;Celine spoke as her eyes began to glow liquid gold. A sphere of light grew her hand. &#34;Burning Redemption!&#34; <BR> <BR>Ganthor wiped his eyes with a massive hand and then pointed a fist at the cocoon. He placed his other hand on the forearm as if steadying a gun. Suddenly a burst of power and an energy version of his fist screamed toward the cocoon. &#34;Eat this!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I know exactly what I&#39;m going to do...&#34;Shielka grasped her pendant, trasforming into a being of pure fire yet again. <BR> <BR>Justice raised his sword, using what little energy he had left to fill it...the last thing his body needed. Yet, it had to be done... &#34;And now...your game ends!&#34; He swung his blazing sword, unleashing a devastating wave of power. The monsters attacked as one, praying the their combined power would be enough. Time seemed to slow down as the attacks sailed toward their target... Finally, Shielka burst forth in a stream of fire to join the combined assault...and then... <BR> <BR>Shielka, the fiery daina zipped past their attacks...and placed herself in their path... <BR> <BR>There was a violent explosion, followed by a feminine scream of anguish that tore through the dark tower like a knife. The smoke cleared...and the daina hovered for a brief second. Her arms were nothing more then bloody stumps, as if shed tried to erect a shield in those last moments. Her wings were torn ragged, hanging onto her back by only a few meager strips of flesh. Her body dripped with blood, most of her skin burned away, in some places right down to the bone. This terrible sight lingered before Shielka fell from the air, joining the dead Magic in the pit... <BR> <BR>What happened? Why?  <BR> <BR>The entire group stood their in utter disbelief. That feeling quickly shifted to terror...as the slow realization kicked in that the cocoon, though damaged, was no destroyed. The daina had killed herself to protect it... Hopelessness and despair sunk in...and then all hope plummeted as the cocoon began to hatch. Whatever beast it held was ripping and clawing it&#39;s way out... <BR> <BR>&#34;Justice, what now??&#34;Ganthor yelled in panic.. Justice answered by collapsing against the wall. He had not the strength to fight anylonger, or even to reply...He could only look on as the beast emerged... <BR> <BR>It was shaped much like Moo...but the fear one felt when gazing upon this abomination was increased ten fold. The beast was twice the size of the dark dragon. It&#39;s fur was midnight black, as was the muscular flesh that moved beneath it. Six massive wings beat behind it, each set progressively smaller as they when down his back. They were not wings of flesh, but pure negative energy. The single tail had been replaced with three, each with an ax like blade. The talons and teeth were a metallic silver, huge blades forming out of the creatures elbows. Instead of two arms the beast wielded four, each with a long tentacle that emerged from the palms. Moo&#39;s face remained virtually unchanged, except he now sported a mane of tendrils that fell about his shoulders almost and writhed like the serpents in a gorgons hair. An energy could be seen pulsating within the beasts throat constantly. <BR> <BR>&#34;Behold...and bow before a new God!&#34;The beast spoke...it sounded like Moo. <BR> <BR>&#34;Moo...fight it!&#34;Justice screamed out with great effort while the others remained frozen in fear... <BR> <BR>&#34;Fight it? Fool...I embrace it. I am forever, eternal, invincible!&#34;Moo roared, turning his attention to the mangled pile of flesh that once was Shielka. With but a gesture she rose upward to him. Moo then placed a clawed hand over her...and her wounds began to heal! &#34;I am the Master now. And my new dominion will need new generals.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No you liar! You promised not to attack us!&#34;Celine screamed over to him. &#34;You said you&#39;d leave this continent alone for a year at least! You gave your word!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Silence!&#34;His voice thundered, literally causing the tower to tremble. A moment later Shielka was awake, and fully healed... <BR> <BR>&#34;...Master...forgive me. I&#39;ll never show the humans mercy again...&#34;The daina spoke, much to the disbelief of the others... <BR> <BR>&#34;You are forgiven and are returned to my side.&#34;This time the voice sounded more like the original Master. Shielka smiled happily and flew over to the group...as if nothing was wrong, as if she hadn&#39;t just betrayed them, but the entire world. The daina ignored everyone except Stoneclaw, whom she fluttered up to almost playfully. The Trident held up his hand, warning the others to stay back.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Why? How...could you betray us like thisss?&#34;Claw hissed aloud, marking the anger in his words. Shielka gave him a strange look, as if he&#39;d just asked the dumbest question in the world. <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you really that surprised?&#34;She said with a grin, &#34;Did you really believe I could betray my Master so easily? He raised me when I would have died in the wastelands...he&#39;s like my father and now that he&#39;s joined with Moo he&#39;s stronger then ever!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Are you crazy? He wanted to put you to death remember!?&#34;Claw retorted... <BR> <BR>&#34;I struck a fellow monster to save the life of a human...I deserved that for my weakness. I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, I was too absorbed in my own self pity...but I&#39;ve had time to think about my actions. I saw the one chance to redeem myself in the eyes of my master. If that meant betrayal...well...&#34; Shielka replied...ending with a shrug. <BR> <BR>&#34;Then why did you kill the other warriors??&#34;Stoneclaw hissed, trying to make sense of all this... <BR> <BR>&#34;They didn&#39;t back me up, not even the ones I called friends.&#34; Shielka responded. &#34;I hated them for that...the others never respected me anyway and I was their leader. If they couldn&#39;t put me on a pedestal I decided to help lay them on a slab.&#34; She paused for a moment, fluttering closer to the Trident.. &#34;I know you hate the humans too...come with me, leave these human loving rejects behind. We&#39;ve already proven how great a team we make...&#34; She caressed the side of his stone face as she spoke... <BR> <BR>&#34;Hmm, tempting...Here&#39;s my answer.&#34;The Trident said in perfect calm...before slashing her across the face with his talons. The blow was so fierce it knocked the daina several feet and left the side of her face mauled. &#34;I hope I was crystal clear!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You let your guard down...&#34;Moo spoke, &#34;You shall keep that scar in remembrance of that folly. And as for you Trident...&#34; The dragon made a very slight gesture and suddenly Stoneclaw was brutally hurled against the wall...The black steel wall buckled under the force, leaving a nasty naga shaped imprint as Claw slid back down to the floor. Celine flew towards him to attack...desperation overriding fear, only to be effortlessly slapped aside. Ganthor charged next, leaping across the pit to deliver a punch and was forced back by an unseen power. The tower shuddered as he landed, breaking his horn in the process...&#34;Pathetic...&#34; <BR> <BR>Justice forced himself to stand...he had no choice, the others needed him. His metal frame shook violently, but he managed...goaded on why the sarcastic remarks of Master Moo and his second Shielka. He took their taunting...and used it to fuel him, drawing strength from his anger... &#34;You...haven&#39;t won yet...&#34; <BR> <BR>The Daina hovered over the hulking form of the Master and sat on his muscled shoulder... &#34;Persistent isn&#39;t he?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Indeed...but you must realize Justice that I am now beyond you and your companions.&#34; Master Moo roared in laughter...his great wings of energy spread wide. He looked to the Durahan and a sick grin curved the sides of the dragons mouth. &#34;And Justice...all deals...are off!&#34; With those dark words the beast surged upward, preparing to burst into the night sky above. A new threat unleashed upon the unsuspecting world. Nothing could stand against him, the most powerful of monsters ever to exist, the greatest among them. An evil in which the world had no defense...The Master had risen... &#34;Who among you can stand against me??&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I stand against you!&#34;A voice called from the right. Their stood the cloaked form of Raa-zor...He held a small disk shaped object between his fingers... &#34;It seems you animals did more harm then good. &#42;Sigh&#42; If you want something done right...&#34; With those words the zyoth hurled the tiny golden disk at Master Moo...The lord of all dragons simply grabbed the object with his upper left hand and crushed the disk... <BR> <BR>&#34;Was &#42;that&#42; supposed to stop me? I-&#34;His voice stopped short as a flash of light engulfed the arm that held the disk. A moment later the arm was covered in clear crystal. Moo attempted to shake it off but couldn&#39;t, as the crystal rapidly began to cover his entire body. It was too late to drop the disk, too late by far as the dragon was devoured by the stasis crystal. Shielka had already retreated and was nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile the monsters watched from below. Justice never expected to see Raa-zor give any further aid...but he wasn&#39;t terribly surprised, the zyoth had saved their skins earlier. Within a minute Master Moo was covered entirely, trapped. His crystallize mass fell from the sky, tumbling into the pit below. The impact caused the tower to tremble yet again...and keep trembling. The dark tower had suffered immensely, taking explosion after gut wrenching explosion. Now the Masters house was coming down...  <BR> <BR>&#34;Justice, we gotta get outta here!&#34;Ganthor screamed, already lumbering out the door. The stronghorn wasn&#39;t waiting for anybody. Celine refused to leave right away, going back for Beatdown&#39;s body...she was not leaving without the fairyhare. Stoneclaw was still hissing furiously over Shielka&#39;s betrayal... Raa-zor had already disappeared, his work done. But all was not well for the old knight...he collapsed back to the floor...and had not the strength to stand again... <BR> <BR>&#34;Lets go old man...&#34;Claw turned to him as the tower began to crumble around them. The lights flickered, walls fell..they ran a serious risk of begin crushed by falling debris. &#34;Let the Master rot in his new grave. We&#39;re goin home...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Home...&#34;Justice muttered, clenching his trains heirloom in his hand.
