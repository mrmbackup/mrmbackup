 It had taken such a long time to finally distill all its secrets and all of its options, but every costly step and every costly turn and jump had proven invaluable.   <BR> <BR>Jorus had been training monsters for a long time, since he had heard of the fabled peaches, capable of bringing longevity to those who eat them.  When he was but fourteen, he found his first peach on an exploration of one of the older jungles.  He kept it secretly, and trained more and more monsters, finding more and more peaches.  By the age of 24, he was ready to begin “the process.”   <BR> <BR>He first planted an entire orchard of the wonders, noting traits from the different jungles and such.  The leftover fruit he shared with his monsters, allowing him to slow down his aging process, too.  Years passed, and he did not age a day.  A peach for breakfast, a peach for lunch, and a peach for dinner, he said.   <BR> <BR>Eventually, he laced the traits of the Golden Peach with the Mock monster breed.  A veritable fountain of youth, the first years were trouble.  At first, the seeds never sprouted.  He checked them and found that something was needed to kick off its growth.   <BR> <BR>Fertilizer of Dragon, harsh as it was, needed to be used.  He was careful only to take the body of a deceased Dragon—with the grant of its soul—and turn it into the necessary fertilizer.  Eventually, his first Mock grew. <BR> <BR>It still needed the essence of Dragon to rush along its crawling pace life span.  The first revolution occurred, when pro- and anti-monster rights factions clashed over the subject of Human sentience.  Throughout the bloody war, only Jorus’s out-of-the way location and his hardy, decades-old monsters prevented his ways from going extinguished. <BR> <BR>His experiments were a success.  He had achieved a form of immortality—removing the life component of physical aging.  He and his monsters could still be killed by ordinary means, but the peaches kept him from sustaining the effects of ill aging.   <BR> <BR>The second revolution came, though.  Using weapons rather then monsters to do the fighting, many of his experiments were destroyed.  He was left with but one peach, and his Mock, which no-one suspected held the secret of eternal youth.  He moved to the other side of the continent, where fighting was nonexistent, and set up a new ranch, with the grand orchard, which had earlier been burnt to the ground.  The idiots… the idiots had never tasted the forbidden fruit.  His Mock found firm root once again, and he began to further distill the secrets of the Golden Peach.   He began to suspect that they were of extraterrestrial origin, but before he could do anything to support his theory, he was sent a notice.   <BR> <BR>“To Mr. Jorus Konath: <BR>	We at FIMBA have been made aware of your current situation.  A trainer lacking an assistant is something we cannot leave unattended.  In a few weeks, we will be sending a new trainer to your area who will help you organize your tasks.  Obviously a man of your talents will understand the value of good staff.  We hope you find Asmen Ran S’adda in good company.” <BR> <BR>	A curse directed at the spirits responsible, Jorus could not help but wonder whether or not FIMBA had sent her to investigate the fact that his name showed up in FIMBA records ages ago.  Thousands of years had passed.  He had never renewed his records.  Perhaps they were checking a viable inaccuracy; so suited him.  But he could not continue his experiments as long as that cursed woman was there… <BR> <BR>	Men will find ways… <BR> <BR> <BR>&#40;Just something I started up&#41;
