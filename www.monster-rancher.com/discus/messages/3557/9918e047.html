 Saguinis looked at his opponent, the Death Dragon named Skullclaw. It was 2 months ago that this demon dragon had arrived, but ever since it had come it had been horrific. Every day something new had gone wrong. Whole herds of goats had been slaughtered with a Fire Breath, sacred objects stolen or desecrated and even 2 houses reduced to rubble by the fits of rage this monstrosity had. Finally the villagers had had enough. <BR>The Mayor had placed a price on the demon&#39;s head, many bounty hunters had tried and failed to dispose of the horror, most of them getting killed with their monsters, but the menace continued. Finally salvation came. <BR>The bounty hunter named Calvin found his way to the town. With him were his best monsters, Cataclysm the Renocraft and Saguinis, a Suezo Mask. Cataclysm was huge even for a Renocraft, with his mighty metal claws he had claimed many a criminal for his master. Considered to be the best hunter ever. If Cataclysm found the location of a bounty, it was as good as caught. <BR>Saguinis was less well known but no less formidable. Extremely intelligent and fast. It was his will that very few saw him as a hero as it would make his location known. He was the assassin of the two, blocking of exits with Blaze Walls and paralysing prey with Lightning. The only well-known fact about him was that he was the son of See-Thru, the Aqua Mask who had won the Legend Cup many years ago. <BR> <BR>&#40;This is my first peice of literature on the Web so please let me know what you think. All the characters in the story are from my game.&#41;

 It would seem most of our stories based on any MR game usually have our very own monsters from the game becoming heroes &#40;or in my case, villains&#41;. <BR> <BR>The only two things I can see are: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Length. Don&#39;t take it to heart, I know some authors don&#39;t like posting a lot at first, but I usually find myself criticizing this. Maybe its just my own greed and thirst for more of the story. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Try using spaces between your paragraphs, makes it easier to follow. <BR> <BR>Your initial writing ability utilizes good usage of vocabulary. This is good. I&#39;m positive you could write out an excellent battle if you went in-depth with it. Right now, this beginning sounds like a screen play, with the characters already in a situation to get into &#40;or out of&#41;. Not bad.
