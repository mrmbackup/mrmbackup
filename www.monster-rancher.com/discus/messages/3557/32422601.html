 Chapter 25:The Reckoning <BR> <BR>Vengeance is a powerful force indeed, though never without price. It had driven Justice through many hardships despite the protests of an age ravaged body. He&#39;d traveled far, driven primarily by a single goal...revenge. Now the two arch enemies stood before each other. Here, in the middle of this death filled arena he stood face to face with the murderous Vor. The sound of grinding metal teeth filled the huge chamber as a rancid smell arose from the acid pit in the center. The entire arena was filled with such sadistic touches...exactly Vor&#39;s style. Neither warrior wasted time with banter. It seemed to both that the time for words had long passed. Hatred lay thick in the air as the two stared each other down. One thing was certain...someone was going to die here. <BR> <BR>Vor made the first attack, launching with unnerving speed for a lorica. Justice barely raised his sword in time to block the strike. Blades clashed, sparks flew, and the Shockwave of force cause both armored bodies to terrible violently. The older durahan stood his ground against a faster and stronger opponent, calling only upon his years of experience. Vor quickly followed up his first blow with a series of strikes aimed for Justice&#39;s torso. The durahan blocked and parried each attack, but found himself being forced backwards against a wall. He was caught in the defensive position... <BR> <BR>&#34;It seems your even weaker then before old man.&#34;Vor said mockingly, delivering a kick to his enemies chest. Justice was slammed back against the wall, feeling yet another dent added to his armor as his sword clattered to the floor. Seeing this Vor grew more confident and lowered his guard...just the moment Justice had been waiting for. <BR> <BR>The durahan surged forward, landing both gauntlets into Vor&#39;s chestplate. The blow staggered him but Justice didn&#39;t let up for a moment, attacking bare fisted, landing blow after merciless blow. Vor dropped his weaponry, desperately trying to defend himself against his opponents unrelenting barrage. He didn&#39;t notice that Justice had forced him nearly to the edge of the acid pit. Finally it&#39;s stench hit him, the acidic fumes corroding his metal form. Vor realized his situation at last and as Justice reeled back for on final punch he sidestepped... <BR> <BR>By the time the old durahan realized he&#39;d overcommitted himself it was too late...he fell forward, hurling into the pit and certain death. Just like that the battle was over, before it had even begun. Vor took a moment to laugh at his opponents foolishness before stepping over to watch his body melt and liquefy. The lorcia drew much pleasure from the suffering of others and watching Justice slowly melt to death, struggling and begging for mercy would make his day. <BR> <BR>Then...the moment Vor stepped close enough to the edge a hand sprung up, grabbing his ankle. Justice gave a good yank and watched as Vor tumbled into the pit, splashing into the acid. Justice pulled himself up, having hung onto the side of the pit to save himself. The acid had been housed improperly...eating deep pits into it&#39;s walls. Meanwhile Vor&#39;s struggles slowed as he sank into the murky, yellowish liquid. <BR> <BR>&#34;Curse you! This isn&#39;t over! This isn&#39;t ov-&#34;The Lorica finally disappeared into the depths. His voice, filled with disbelief and fury was drowned as well by the burning fluid.  <BR> <BR>Justice gazed down into the bubbling pit, still rattled from what had just transpired. If the durahan housed lungs in his steel frame they&#39;d be heaving right now. Still he did not celebrate...even as his hated rival disappeared into the abyss. The old warrior remained wary, whether it was experience or simple disbelief that Vor could be vanquished so easily he could not tell. Time passed and the Lorica did not arise, it was over. It felt a hollow victory however...Justice had hoped this moment would bring peace to his troubled heart. The guilt, the sadness, the profound sense of loss...none of them faded with Vor&#39;s destruction. <BR> <BR>He was about to turn away, find Liqua and finish the task when an unexpected spark caught his attention. Without hesitation Justice circled the acid pit and walked up the stairs behind it in quick, clomping steps. There...in a small alcove set in the wall...was his trainers family heirloom. The crimson glow in the durahans helm shined brighter as he beheld it. The gem had a beam of light flowing through it...obviously used to focus it. What purpose it provided the tower was unknown, and meaningless at this point. Justice reached for it, proudly reclaiming Cid&#39;s most prized possession... <BR> <BR>Suddenly he stopped, his limbs frozen by the wicked laughter that filled the air. Slowly, Justice forced himself to turn around and beheld none other then Vor! He hovered above the acid pit, arms crossed, yellow slime dripping off in a small shower. The lorica&#39;s armor was peppered with small holes, the edges brown and corroded. He was encompassed by an aura...it radiated pure energy, seeming to hold his failing body together. <BR> <BR>&#34;Congratulations old timer...&#34;Vor mocked, waving a blazing saber. The sword left trails of fire lingering in the air as it was swung in warning. &#34;You&#39;ve earned my respect. But I grow tired of this endless conflict...you who dared to hunt me like a dog! I shall tear you limb from limb! Do you hear me!&#34; <BR> <BR>With those crazed words Vor hurled a glowing sphere at his opponent. The warrior was left with no choice, leaping from the platform. He fell fifteen feet, landing with a horrible crash that shook every piece of plating on his body. Justice looked up just in time to see the entire platform erupt into a brilliant explosion, destroying Cid&#39;s treasure in the blast. A cloud of black smoke rose as a fire began, filling the air with the all too familiar smell of fried electronics. <BR> <BR>Justice forced himself to stand as an aging body protested. It screamed at him, enough was enough...just as it had done in Moo&#39;s flying fortress. Alas, Justice paid no heed, welling with hatred anew. Not only had this beast murdered his trainer...but had now decimated his family treasure. That was the last straw... <BR> <BR>In those moments...something came over the durahan that even he was not fully aware of. Vor unleashed a fiery rain of energy spheres, raining death from above. Justice leapt from their paths with agility he had not mustered in years. He spotted Vor&#39;s shield lying on the floor and grabbed it as he rolled safely away from another blast. He would have hurled the shield, Frisbee style, at his enemy...but a lorica shield wasn&#39;t shaped for such an attack. Instead he leaped up at Vor, looking to sink the pointed edge into his helm. Vor backhanded him effortlessly and Justice crashed back to the floor with another tremor. Vor descended...lifting the fallen warrior and carrying him to the grinding machine. Justice, still dazed, was placed in front of it...about to be torn to scrap metal by it&#39;s teeth. <BR> <BR>&#34;Pity...to come all this way and to end up as, well &#39;foil&#39;.&#34;Vor laughed once again. &#34;Any last words before I send you to oblivion?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Vor...&#34;Justice spoke weakly, clearly exhausted, but not lacking in venom.&#34;You talk...too much.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You dare insult me??&#34;Vor punched at Justice in anger. The older warrior dodged the blow and watched as Vor&#39;s fist was pulled into the grinder. The sound that followed...of twisting, tearing steel was quite disturbing to a durahan. Justice backed away, trying to collect himself. His limbs were freezing up on him, rebelling...and at the worst possible time. Vor pulled himself from the device, his right arm torn off completely. All that remained were unsightly strips of metal around the shoulder area, twisted and mangled. Justice knew this was his last chance to defeat his enemy... <BR> <BR>So, the warriors met in close combat once again, the elder proving his might in unarmed combat. He delivered a series of unstoppable blows to Vor&#39;s chest and helm, aiming always for the structural weakpoints created by the acid bath. Each punch and kick connected with a loud &#39;CLANG&#39; as the lorica recoiled. He was weakening, barely able to defend himself. Justice suddenly let loose and spinning roundhouse, quite impressive for one his age and perfectly executed. Vor hit the ground with a crash, scrambling to his feet. This was it...at last, time to deliver the death blow.

 &#34;Aaarrggghh!&#34;Justice cried out loud as pain vibrated through his frame. His body was rebelling against him, and he could ignore it no longer. But this was all the opening Vor needed. What happened next was over in the blink of an eye...Vor summoned his energy blade and with one, skillful movement thrust it straight into his enemies chest. The sword passed through the durahan&#39;s battered form like paper, the end sticking out of his back, alas the lorica didn&#39;t stop there. Three more times did the energy sword pierce the durahans chest, each blow causing his old body to jerk violently. Vor withdrew the sword the last time and all Justice knew at that moment was anguish. He fell, flat on his back, broken at last.... <BR> <BR>Vor took his time, casually strolling over for the kill. Even after all this he was still acting overconfident. Of course this time he had reason too, Justice was defeated. What&#39;s more, laying there in pain the prospect of death didn&#39;t seem so bad. A release from the torment was to be welcomed...and more importantly...perhaps in death he would see his beloved master again. But once again...something caught his eye. The arena had been reduced to rubble...but shining in the wreckage he could see Cid&#39;s treasure. It was broken, but not entirely, at least half still remained intact. Seeing this brought back the fire to win this conflict. He was not dead yet...nor would he die before avenging his trainer. That&#39;s when he felt it, white light pouring out of the ragged holes in his chest, filling his entire being with raw Power. Vor staggered back in shock as Justice arose, enveloped in a brilliant glow. Calmly the warrior walked a few paces and scooped up his sword, it also catching ablaze with glorious white fire. <BR> <BR>&#34;Vor, it is time you faced Justice.&#34;He spoke, evoking his namesake as he attacked. Vor scrambled for his fallen shield, lifting it to block the strike. Justice struck, his sword leaving trails of white as it shattered the crimson shield with one fearsome blow. Justice pressed the attack, blowing Vor&#39;s chest to pieces with the second blow and slicing his helm in half with the third. The screams of his adversary filled the air as points of light shot out from the openings in his armor. Finally the screaming faded, as did the light as the once mighty Vor collapsed to the floor like so much kitchen ware, nothing more then a lifeless suit of rusting armor. The power and strength granted Justice faded as well and he leaned against the wall...a broken durahan. His body had all but shutdown at this point... <BR> <BR>&#34;Justice!&#34;A voice screamed from behind and he turned to see StoneClaw. The Trident looked down at what remained of Vor and grinned. &#34;..guess the jobs done, I got the oth-&#34;He stopped in mid sentence as Liqua leaped out of the shadows, talons poised to tear Claw apart from behind. The aqua cutter, amazingly was STILL alive, though barely. Justice wasted no time, hurling his blade at Liqua. His aim was true and liqua was pierced right through the heart. He fell from the air, flopping around like a dying fish before finally expiring...after a long gurgling sound. Now the two murderers lay no more then ten feet apart, one in a heap of soulless metal, the other in a pool of blood. At last...their trainer had been avenged. <BR> <BR>&#34;S-stone...Claw...&#34;Justice spoke in short, weakened breaths. It was easy to see that far more then exhaustion plagued him. &#34;Find....Moo, Destroy...the master. I&#39;ll catch up...go before...it&#39;s too late.&#34; <BR> <BR>Claw didn&#39;t try to argue, merely nodding and leaving to join the others. Justice lagged behind...picking up what remained of Cid&#39;s gem and upon turning around was treated to another unwelcome surprise. Vor, horribly damaged as he was, simply refused to die and was in the process of trying to stand. As pitiful as he looked Justice could find no sympathy in his heart for this murderer. Wordlessly the old durahan crossed the distance between them... <BR> <BR>&#34;Curse..you...Master...where is my...power? Where is my-&#34;Vor rambled as Justice approached, plucking his blade from Liqua&#39;s chest... <BR> <BR>&#34;Don&#39;t you know when to die?&#34;Justice spat as he lifted his nemesis and sent him hurtling into the nearby acid pit. The act was quite draining...but what he did next sapped even more energy from his tired body. As Vor sank into the pit Justice held his sword aloft and focused the power of lightening into the blade. He then let his electrified sword fall into the pit. The acidic fluid caught ablaze...&#34;Go to hell Vor.&#34; <BR> <BR>That said, only one more task remained. Limping weakly into the darkened corridor he went to join the others as Vor&#39;s screams echoed and finally faded behind him. It was time...for the final clash against the Master. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Fear...it was one emotion Moo was hardly familiar with, one he had never known until this moment. The dragon had cut through the Master&#39;s defenses with ease, suffering only a few burn marks on his grayish fur. To his wonder he found the circular door to the main chamber half opened, it took little to force his way inside. Blackness surrounded him, so thick that even his eyes couldn&#39;t pierce the midnight cloak. Fearing no mere darkness Moo called out a challenge...and was promptly answered. The overhead lighting sparked to life, revealing at long last the enemy which until this moment had remained faceless. A huge mass of writhing gray tendrils, seeming to fill the rooms considerable length. At their heart sat a single eye, the size of Moo himself. It&#39;s pupil was a swirl of red and black surrounded by a gray iris. The eye blinked once, sitting in a sea of tentacles, lashing them like a striking cobra.  <BR> <BR>Slowly, the dark dragons worries subsided as he took a good look at this freakish thing. It had to be completely immobile, no defensive weaponry in place. The ceiling was high, giving Moo more then enough room for an airborne maneuver. Suddenly the dark ones laughter shattered the silence of the moment. This thing wasn&#39;t frightening, it was like something out of a bad horror story. He might as well be fighting a giant slug.  <BR> <BR>Moo took to the air, flapping his powerful wings. Tendrils lashed out to ensnare him but were unsuccessful to say the least. Moo avoided the attacks deftly, soaring higher and then diving at his insidious enemy with claws outstretched. It was all over a moment later as Moo&#39;s talons sliced into the soft tissue of the Masters eye. The gray tendrils went limp instantly and a faint, far off cry could be heard. The dragon ripped his slime covered hand out and roared in victory, proving once and for all that none was greater then him. <BR> <BR>Yet his celebration was cut short. The eye remained lifeless...but there was movement within. Suddenly Moo found himself being lifted off the ground by an unseen force. He was paralyzed, unable to resist as he was repeatedly and brutally slammed to the floor. On the forth battering he felt a loud crack as one of his wings broke, the jagged bone slicing the leathery membranes. Finally he was dumped some twenty feet from the eye and watched the coming emergence in a pain filled daze. <BR> <BR>The creature that emerged from the cocoon-like eye was frightening indeed. Man-shaped but greater by far, standing a few feet over Moo himself. Ebony armor literally seemed fused to it&#39;s dark flesh. It&#39;s hands were clawed, long grayish tentacles springing from it&#39;s wrists. Metallic blades grafted to it&#39;s forearms glinted in the dim light. The fiend had no face to speak of, lacking a mouth entirely and possessing only two black slender eyes. Lashing tendrils protruded from it&#39;s back, writhing behind him in a haunting dance. <BR> <BR>~I have awaited this moment Moo...of revenge.~ <BR> <BR>The dragon roared as the voice pierced his mind, cutting through his mental barriers like a hot knife. He felt it searching, probing, invading the inner reaches of his being. Moo thrashed, trying in vain to resist the invasion but the Masters power in this area was absolute. In a moment the faceless one had complete access to Moo&#39;s thoughts and memories... <BR> <BR>~What is this....confusion? Do you not remember?~ <BR> <BR>With those words Moo found himself ensnared by the Masters tentacles. Binding his limbs, encircling his neck in a half strangle and lifting his considerable mass off the ground with ease. Meanwhile the Master approached; drawing closer with long, powerful strides. <BR> <BR>~Fear not...all will be revealed...and then...you shall face...Oblivion.~

 Sorry Br, I&#39;ve been out of town for sopme time now. Better late than never though, and I must say hats off once more. Master has been revealed, but Liqua and Vor can&#39;t stay down. If they come back, man you got some serious villin-saving issues. :0&#41;
