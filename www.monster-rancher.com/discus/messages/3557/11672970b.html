 Chapter 1: Mercenaries <BR> <BR>She sat upon her favorite boulder, heedless of the waterfall that thundered into the lake just behind her. The Ripper sat cross legged, head bowed deeply in meditation. It was a time of blissful emptiness, void of thought and feeling. She could not feel the heat of the sun on this stuffy summers day, nor admire the clear blue sky above, unmarred by a single gray cloud. She was even oblivious to the small spider that was crawling up the side of her sleek, deadly form. Her long, gorgeous tail wavered slightly, but otherwise stood straight and tall behind her. It was a daily ritual of Nadira&#39;s, to simply come out here and just &#39;be&#39;. To forget whatever troubles or warring emotions she might have and put her head in the game for the mission to come. Yes, the mission ... it was about time to get going. <BR> <BR>Slowly, her dark eyes opened scanning the surround as if seeing it for the first time and her ears swiveled to take in every sound. The borders of the forest stretched out endlessly to her left, still proudly showing their leaves of emerald green in spite of autumns fast approach. To her right stood the dirt path that would eventually lead to Kathela, the nearest city, known for the ferocity of the battles that took place within it&#39;s famed coliseum. Her target would be competing in the tournament. All that was left to do was to round up the rest of her team. This assignment, she believed, would be an easy one. <BR> <BR>Nadira stood, stretching the stiffness out of her limbs and brushing smooth her coat of short, silvery gray fur. She was quite the average Ripper in appearance, save for her hair trademark spiky hair which had now grown so long that it fell down to her shoulders rather then sticking straight back. She extended her claws and took a few quick swipes at the air. Yes, she was a fighting machine. An invincible engine of destruction. Nothing, and no one could stop her. <BR> <BR>It was then Nadira noticed the rather hairy spider that was clinging to her side. <BR> <BR>The shriek that followed could be heard for miles... <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#42;clop&#42; &#42;clop&#42; &#42;clop&#42; <BR> <BR>It was the rather disturbing sound of a Wracky, pacing back and forth along the dirt road, just outside of Kathela. Of course, there wasn&#39;t much about a Wracky that &#42;wasn&#39;t&#42; disturbing. The little creature looked less like a monster and more like a possessed doll. A knife wielding puppet from a child&#39;s nightmares given thought and form. Standing beside him was an equally unnerving sight, a huge black Jelaydon. A beaclon mixed with Zan, just the sight of him was enough to give other monsters cause to flee. They were a dangerous pair, but still missing one of their number. <BR> <BR>The Wracky stalked impatiently, cutting down any blades of grass and flowers that just happened to be in his path. He had a sudden craving for a flesh and blood target. Something that bled and screamed when his little knife bit into it. <BR> <BR>Then they heard the shriek. <BR> <BR>&#34;Did you hear that Grim? The boss&#39;s in trouble!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No. She isss not.&#34; The Beaclon responded in a soft hiss. <BR> <BR>&#34;What do ya mean she&#39;s not in trouble!? Are ya deaf!?&#34; The little Wracky jumped up and down, waving his knife in a frantic attempt to look big and imposing. It just wasn&#39;t working for him. <BR> <BR>&#34;When am I ever wrong?&#34; Grim responded and sure enough Nadira was strolling down out of the hills, her head held high, walking casually as if nothing was wrong. <BR> <BR>&#34;Boss! What happened to ya?&#34; The Wracky ran around her in half panicked circles. Nadira had to strong urge to kick the little runt just so he&#39;d stay still. <BR> <BR>&#34;Absolutely nothing. I have no idea what your talking about.&#34; She watched as her too companions gave each other looks of disbelief and then added. &#34;I was just enjoying my daily meditation. You know? My daily thirty minutes of peace when I&#39;m free of you idiots?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Another spider no doubt.&#34; The Beaclon chucked deeply and Nadira&#39;s hair spikes literally stood on end. The Wracky, Jabber, promptly started cackling along with him. <BR> <BR>&#34;I don&#39;t understand Boss. Grim&#39;s a lot bigger then some harmless little spider, and ya don&#39;t scream around him.&#34; Jabber pointed out, much to Nadira&#39;s frustration. <BR> <BR>&#34;It wasn&#39;t little! It was huge! It was a big, hairy spider of death borne from the pits of hell to torment me!&#34; The female Ripper clenched her hands into twin fists. &#34;And if I hear one more wise crack...&#34;  <BR> <BR>Grim and Jabber both knew when to push the envelop with Nadira and this wasn&#39;t one of those times. They grew serious at once, knowing the Ripper was quite capable of attacking them if she was pushed hard enough. They would jest and laugh another time, for now they had a mission to complete, and there was nothing funny about the work these three did. The Wracky and the Jelaydon exchanged eager glances as Nadira gave the details of the latest assignment. Things were about to take a much darker turn... <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Kathela was ancient city, it&#39;s former grandeur long lost to the ravages of time. Most of it&#39;s sweeping archways and indomitable towers torn down, replaced by more modern buildings that looked plain and uninspired by comparison. The aged streets had never been repaved, broken and disheveled, an annoyance to walk upon. What&#39;s more, the city was situated practically in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by hills and rock quarries that stretched to the horizon. There was a forest near, but it was a cursed place, many thought, where the spirits of dead monsters dwelt. One thing kept Kathela alive, however, it&#39;s greatest and only draw that brought tourist from across the lands. The Crimson Eye, a huge, oval shaped coliseum that had hosted some of the most brutal battles in F.I.M.B.A&#39;s history. There was much would come considerable fame to the Trainer who won this Tournament. But sadly, with such high stakes there was always someone willing to go to extreme lengths to manipulate the outcome... <BR> <BR>Crowds of eager fight fans milled about, discussing the last battle in excited tones. Others desperately sought to find a good seat for the next match. Although monsters were not allowed to roam the streets freely in Kathela, no one paid any mind to the cloaked Ripper who slipped from shadow to shadow. She stopped only to glance up at the scoreboard. As predicted, two monsters in particular had torn through the opposition like a hot wind. The local underdog, Titanus, a formidable mix of Golem and Jell. And then, there was the crowd favorite, a beautiful Undine who was expected to win the tournament with one hand behind her back. <BR> <BR>&#34;Oshin...&#34; Nadira whispered under her breath. The Undine was her target. Certain powerful people had bet a certain large fortune on Titanus&#39;s victory, and aimed to increase their investment ten fold. Nadira&#39;s mission was simple, make sure Oshin did not win the final match of the tourney. The Ripper wondered how easy it would be to ambush the Undine and tear out her throat. She pushed the thought out of her skull. Oshin had to be forced to forfeit. All Nadira had to do was make sure the Undine was in no condition to fight. <BR> <BR>&#34;Jabber, Grim.. you better have taken care of things on your end...&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Oshin returned to the competitors waiting area, the roar of the crowd echoing through the stone archway behind her. What Monster couldn&#39;t appreciate the rush of the crowds approval. Hundreds, if not thousands cheering her name, practically worshipping her as a war goddess. However the thrill of the moment always made reality that much harsher. As the iron wrought doors slammed behind the Undine she found herself in a room that was little more then an oversized cage. Kathela, for all it&#39;s famous battles, treated it&#39;s monsters worse then most other large cities, herding them around like cattle. <BR> <BR>The little Undine sat uncomfortably on a dirty stone bench, fighting a sudden feeling of weariness when her trainer arrived. <BR> <BR>&#34;That was a great fight Oshin.&#34; Lillian Iver was standing there, peering through the bars that kept Trainers and Monsters separated, as if any loyal monster would harm it&#39;s trainer. She was a kind woman, with honey blonde hair and green eyes. Starting out as a ranchers apprentice, Lillian eventually broke off to start her own ranch and had know only success ever since. She was especially pleased with Oshin, her strongest monster yet, who&#39;s victory today could put her in reach of the grand championship. &#34;Now, don&#39;t get complacent. You still have one more opponent and he&#39;s undefeated.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, I am aware.&#34; Oshin responded in a sweet, melodious voice. &#34;But the Poseidon is far too slow to ever hit me, and not intelligent enough to resist my attacks. I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s going to be a rather quick battle.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I thought I told you not to underestimate your opponent.&#34; Her voice was stern but there was a smile at the edge of her lips. Lillian knew her monster was right. Titanus wouldn&#39;t stand a chance. <BR> <BR>&#34;Excuse me, madam?&#34; One of the local guards gave her a respectful nod. &#34;Your assistant is looking for you.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Thomas?&#34; Lillian replied, arching a curious brow.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes, he says it&#39;s urgent.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Oh, very well.&#34; She sighed dramatically. Thomas was a pain in the rear, and Lillian prayed often that she hadn&#39;t been as annoying to the ranchers she worked for in the past. &#34;Oshin, I better see what this is about. Trainers aren&#39;t allowed to give commands on the final match, not that you&#39;ll need them. Take him down!&#34; <BR> <BR>Oshin clapped her hands together and fluttered enthusiastically. &#34;I will! I&#39;ll make you proud!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m already proud of you.&#34; Lillian smiled warmly and then added. &#34;But I could always use a new trophy.&#34; With that the guard led her off, leaving a very excited Oshin alone, but primed for battle.  <BR> <BR>Oshin never saw her alive again. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>The trainers waiting room was completely deserted. It wasn&#39;t all that unusual, most of them were probably out waiting for the final match to start. This was where the guard said Thomas was waiting for her, though. Why wasn&#39;t he here? Something just wasn&#39;t right, and a moment later her suspicions were confirmed when she heard a sharp, &#39;click&#39;.  <BR> <BR>The door had been locked behind her. <BR> <BR>Alarmed, Lillian cast around, as if to confirm that she was indeed alone. She was just about to call out when she noticed something she hadn&#39;t seen before. There, sitting on one of the loungers was a small wooden doll. It might have been cute, a children&#39;s toy with it&#39;s painted face and dark blue suspenders. That is, until one noticed that it&#39;s main accessory was a very real knife.  <BR> <BR>There was something undeniably evil about that doll... <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#34;This is it...&#34; <BR> <BR>Oshin stood before the great doors, eyes closed, every thought on victory, every muscle tensed and trembling with the sheer electricity in the air. This would be the greatest arena battle of her career. No... perhaps for a trainer it was only a career. For a monster, the battle was life itself. So very focused on the coming fight was the Undine, for she didn&#39;t realize that she was no longer alone. <BR> <BR>&#34;So...your Oshin? Can&#39;t say I&#39;m impressed.&#34; A scathing female voice called being the Undine, dripping with bitterness. &#34;And what kind of name is Oshin? Was it your foolish trainer trying to be witty?&#34; <BR> <BR>She turned around calmly, the Undine, and where another monster might have been seeing red, Oshin retained a sort of serenity about herself. She had never seen many Rippers in her life, but they were monsters just like her kind. That&#39;s really all she needed to know. &#34;I would ask you not to speak of my trainer in such a way, please.&#34; There was no malice in that soft, sing song voice, no anger at the apparent insult. &#34;I would like to discuss this further, but I have a match in mere moments.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Actually, I&#39;m really sorry..&#34; The Rippers voice spoke with a note of sincerity that could have fooled anyone. She stepped forward, extending a clawed hand seemingly as a gesture of peace. Oshin looked at her, apprehensive for only a moment, before taking that extended hand. &#34;I went too far, calling you names. It&#39;s just that I lost my old trainer recently... I&#39;m jealous of you all who still have yours.&#34; <BR> <BR>The little Undine looked as if her heart was breaking. The look of sorrow in her eyes made even the cunning Ripper feel a little guilty about lying to her face. &#34;Please, I&#39;d like to speak with you further, but I really must stay focused on the match right now.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Actually, your going to forfeit the match I fear.&#34; The Ripper said with what could pass for a sly grin.  <BR> <BR>&#34;What? No I&#39;m not. I&#39;m-&#34; She never finished the sentence. The Ripper, moving faster any Monster Oshin had ever encountered in the arena, suddenly drove a knee right into the fragile Undine&#39;s stomach. Not used to being struck, she collapsed gasping desperately for air and finding none. She couldn&#39;t react as the Ripper seized her by the hair.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Titanus is going to win this tourney.&#34; The Ripper hissed, flexing her talons. &#34;And as for you, I&#39;m here to clip your wings.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#34;LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! The final match of the Kathela tournament is about to commence!! Finally, too of the strongest monsters of their class will meet head on! Let the arena doors open and witness the battle between TITANUS and OSHIN!&#34; <BR> <BR>Titanus stormed out of his waiting chamber first, drawing a maelstrom of boo&#39;s and jeers from the crowd. Someone in the stands started a very unflattering chant that soon swept the entire arena. Titanus, however, seemed completely unfazed by the taunting. Every fiber of his being dead set on crushing a certain Undine into the blood soaked dust of the arena floor. He had come too far to be stopped now. <BR> <BR>He was an imposing sight at least, the mass and size of a Golem twinned with a jells resistance to physical harm. He thought himself invincible. Not because of his skill or his strength, but because Titanus knew his victory was assured. After all, you didn&#39;t always need talent and skill to make it to the top of the arena latter. <BR> <BR>You just needed the right friends. <BR> <BR>Finally the jeers and chants tapered off as Oshin&#39;s door opened. The crowd went deathly silent in that moment, as if holding there breaths in anticipation. When the Undine walked out onto the arena the crowd exploded, but only for a moment.  <BR> <BR>Slowly the cheers and cries of the fans died to nothing. The onlookers, trainers, monsters and fans alike all shocked into a sort of strange numbness. Yes, Oshin walked, but only just barely, wavering on every step. Normally she would have flown, but that was impossible with one wing badly broken, nearly torn from her back. Her delicate form bruised and battered, and she cradled a shattered arm as she came to stand before Titanus, who was also stunned. Not by her condition, but by the fact that his opponent still dared to face him after being so badly injured. <BR> <BR>&#34;You should have given up the match.&#34; Titanus rumbled, feeling a bit of pity for his brave adversary, but not enough to keep from crushing her when the bell rang. <BR> <BR>&#34;Said.. I&#39;d beat you...&#34; The Undine looked as though she&#39;d topple over any moment.  <BR> <BR>&#34;And so I shall beat you.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>High above the stands a Ripper watched in total disbelief. Nadira had come to watch Titanus be awarded the victory by default. Now Oshin had actually dragged herself out there to face a monster who could smash her with it&#39;s smallest finger. For a fleeting instant Nadira feared what would happen should the Undine be victorious. No, never, impossible... One hit and the match wouldn&#39;t just be over, Oshin would be dead. <BR> <BR>&#34;She&#39;s got guts at least.&#34; Nadira spoke to herself, settling down to watch the battle. &#34;This should be something to see...&#34;
