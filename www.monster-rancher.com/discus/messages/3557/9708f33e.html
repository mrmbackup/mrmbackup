 The walk back to town was a slow one.  Deliberately so.  Durahan was an odd monster, I thought.  Ever time Angel made a sound of discomfort, he would stop, make a hollow &#39;hmm!&#39; noise and get my attention.  Checking on her, propping her up a little on his shoulder as best I could, I would pet Durahan on the shoulder in a &#39;good job&#39; sort of way, and we would continue.  I could almost feel an aura of nobility from this monster, sort of the feeling you get when you stand next to a real knight, who follows his code not only to the letter, but to the death. <BR> <BR>I liked that.  I think it was just what I needed at that exact moment, with Angel hurt, my father probably dead and a long journey ahead of me.  Boy did I luck out with Durahan. <BR> <BR>When we arrived at the inn, another surprise awaited us.  Not a bad one really, but extremely unexpected.  The innkeeper looked at me walk in with both bags, puzzled as I put them down, then almost oozing with happiness when he saw Durahan.  &#39;You used the shrine?  Really?  That means you can...!&#39; <BR> <BR>I was about the hit him to get his attention off Durahan, but a hollow and rather annoyed &#39;HMM!&#39; Stopped his bubbling, and brought his attention to the battered looking Angel.  &#39;Oh my!  Um, I&#39;ll go fetch the village doctor, just go to your room, I&#39;ll have him presently.&#39; <BR> <BR>I think it was about an hour before the light knock at my room door announced the doctor.  We had already laid Angel on the single bed, head propped up with the pillow, and covered with the blanket.  The doctor was a rather tall man.  Taller than Durahan by at least a head.  But he was rather thin as well, giving his aged face a wizened look, without looking severe.  &#39;I take it your pixie...&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;Angel.&#39;  I interrupted him, not unkindly, &#39;She got in the way of me and the wall when I used the shrine.  I know she has at least two broken ribs...&#39;  I felt that &#39;green&#39; feeling again. <BR> <BR>The doctor smiled patiently, and with an understanding nod, and a tone of professionalism he said, &#39;Let me take a look.  I&#39;ll find out exactly what&#39;s wrong.&#39;  And with that, he set to work, removing the blanket to Angel&#39;s waist.  Various &#39;hm&#39; and &#39;I see&#39; noises, as well as delicate pokes and prods later, he opened his doctor&#39;s bag, and removed a roll of bandages from it.  &#39;You know your monster here well.  Three broken ribs.  After I&#39;m done setting them properly, may I examine the rest of her?&#39;  He asked, propping the still sleeping Angel up, and rolling the bandages tightly around her ribs.  With a look to me, then a slightly nervous one to Durahan, he continued.  &#39;I&#39;m not a monster doctor really.  But the &#39;pixie&#39; type monsters are very close to humans.  Almost everything is in the same place.&#39; <BR> <BR>I look back on this now, and realize the reason for the doctor&#39;s nervousness.  Thinking of his explanation now, makes it clear.  I guess some people do enjoy a little more than a pixie&#39;s company as a pet.  Not knowing his meaning then, however, didn&#39;t stop me from nodding. <BR> <BR>He talked while he worked, examining her head gently, as I held her shoulders to keep her sitting up.  &#39;You are a very lucky boy you know.  Not many people have a &#39;mixed&#39; monster like this anymore.  Back in the old days they were common, but they seem to have been fading off...&#39;  He paused in his ramblings to get a bit of cotton and a clear glass container with a cork stopper.  &#39;Hm, bump on the head here...&#39;  He wet the cotton ball with the liquid, and dabbed it against the back of Angel&#39;s skull.  &#39;Anyhow.  You know that shrine hasn&#39;t been used for a long time.  At least oh...  Fifty years.  People said it was cursed after the war that happened there, and nobody&#39;s ever tried to use it for sacred disks since.&#39; <BR> <BR>He gently unfolded each of Angel&#39;s feathery wings in turn, pausing to set one of the bones with a loud &#39;pop&#39;.  Wincing at the noise I nodded.  &#39;I think it was cursed.  I almost failed to raise Durahan from the disk.&#39; <BR> <BR>He paused his application of a splint to Angel&#39;s wing.  &#39;I thought you had to be of the shrine keeper&#39;s blood, or have passed a trial or something.  You look a little young to be a shrine keeper.&#39; <BR> <BR>Again, looking back, I should have seen this one coming.  &#39;I um, seem to have passed the test.&#39;  Durahan chose that moment to nod with that funny &#39;squeaky squeak&#39;. <BR> <BR>We set Angel down on the bed gently, and he stripped the rest of the sheet off her.  &#39;Hm.  You&#39;ll probably be seeing the mayor tomorrow then.&#39;  He gently poked and prodded at Angel&#39;s legs, getting a slight smile from the sleeping monster, &#39;Interesting.  I never thought monsters could be ticklish.&#39;  I gave him a raised eyebrow, and he &#39;ahem&#39;ed uncomfortably.  &#39;Nothing wrong with her legs...  Or her feet, aside from doing a lot of walking.  You should get her shoes or something if you plan on walking more.&#39; <BR> <BR>I nodded, &#39;Wearing a backpack stops her from using her wings.&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;I guess it would.  Anyhow.  Make sure, and I mean absolutely sure, she rests, and eats well.  She is very lucky they were just barely broken, or her lungs may have been damaged, and I would be giving you the name of the local undertaker now.&#39;  His voice was very serious, and I nodded quietly, not bothering to correct him about the &#39;dead monster&#39; comment.  &#39;I&#39;ll come back in a couple of days.  No, don&#39;t worry about payment yet.&#39;  He said as he stood and I reached for my little bag of money. <BR> <BR>After he was gone, I looked to Angel, and covered her back up with the blanket.  Then with a look to Durahan, I asked, &#39;Tired?&#39;  Again, I got that &#39;offended&#39; look, but I waved it off.  &#39;I know you are, don&#39;t try and hide it.&#39;  I gave the chest plate on my walking suit of armor a light tap with my knuckles.  &#39;Get some rest.  You deserve it.&#39;  And with that, he nodded slowly, went to the door, and sat down, leaning against it.  Nobody was getting in through the door, not until he moved. <BR> <BR>Smart, strong and noble to a fault, I thought as I fluffed the pillow to my bedroll and lay down.  My father sure knew how to choose them I guess. <BR> <BR>Of coarse though, these thoughts brought on sadness, and I cried myself to sleep. <BR> <BR>----------- <BR> <BR>=^_^=  there you go, my fans, whomever you may be.  Not as big an update as usual, but the next part is a little long to be included in this one as well.  &#40;I have it planned, not written and its 9 AM in the morning, after working a grave yard shift&#41;  So, fear not.  I think I&#39;m on a roll. <BR> <BR>As always.  Questions, comments, and I don&#39;t care what kind of comments they are, are desired.
