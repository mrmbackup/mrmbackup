<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B>CHB</B> on <B>Tuesday, May 29, 2001 - 04:52 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 Three weeks had passed, seemingly in a flash. Galin and Moonshadow trained feverishly in one of the many gyms and training centers of the Jills&#39;. They had lost, been utterly defeated and, if not for Roketh, would have died. <BR> <BR>&#34;I still can&#39;t believe it!&#34; Galin screamed as he swung both his right hands at the nimble Tiger, who dodged easily, &#34;I can&#39;t be so weak, I refuse to!&#34; <BR> <BR>They were currently in a large, steel gymnasium. Several Jill lined the catwalk that encircled the facility&#39;s interior. Most of them had already placed bets, but currently looked on in amazement. The room itself was roughly the size of a football field, shaped the same, too. It had a thick, red track running along the wall, eventually coming back to itself. In the center of it were several different training devices in place. A ring, 16x16 was in place, this is where they currently were practicing. Other than this, a bench set large enough for a Jill, several chains hanging from the roof over a trampoline like structure, obviously for battling in the air, and a shooting range at the far end. <BR> <BR>Moonshadow slid out of the small ring, tired of dodging in such small confines, &#34;Tell me about it, but let us broaden our fighting range.&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin complied with enthusiasm; he could barely fit in the ring. The blue dragon leaped over the top rope and attempted to stomp the Terror Dog. Naturally, Moonshadow evaded with ease, and then he took off around the track at great speeds. Galin then took flight. The building was like a dome, with enough room to fit twenty airborne Dragons in it. The Jill that owned the building had told them to do as they pleased with this one, for he had five in all, this one was of no great importance. He was, after all, one of the wealthier Jill of the city. Galin was one never to miss the opportunity to destroy something. He glided about ten yards behind the insanely fast Moonshadow. He opened each of his hands and then his mouth as he screamed, &#34;Aura Balls!&#34; <BR> <BR>Moonshadow knew exactly what this entailed, and was not exactly prepared. Several explosions rang off right behind him. He turned his head slightly to see the pursuing Dragon shooting fireballs from his mouth as well. Moonshadow then realized where he was on the track. <BR> <BR>Galin was not holding back, he knew Moonshadow could take a decent hit, plus the medical advances of the Jill were unprecedented. He decided he had wasted enough energy on machine gun like fire. He halted briefly to charge up each of his hands and his breath. He shot a glistening ball from each hand and one massive fireball in his mouth, at the same time, at the same target. The explosion was huge, but not enough to faze the massive form of Galin, who blew right through the flying track and smoke. Oddly enough, he didn&#39;t see Moonshadow. Galin glanced up and saw the wall getting closer at a very uncomfortable rate of speed. As he attempted to halt, a blitzing black form shot along the wall, firing lightning at the Dragon as it buzzed past him. <BR> <BR>Galin pulled his head back and put his feet first. Galin planted his feet in the wall, drop kick style, and then springboarded off to resume his chase, &#34;Nice wall run you got there, Moonshadow.&#34; <BR> <BR>Moonshadow fell back to the track, losing virtually none of his speed, &#34;Yeah, nice wall kiss of yours, Caption Bulk.&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin grinned at his partner&#39;s jest. Moonshadow just had a way with words. Galin sat down and looked over at the bench set, &#34;You dance around the track a bit more, I think I&#39;ll toy with the weights.&#34; <BR> <BR>Moonshadow stopped about ten feet from Galin, who moseyed over to the bench set. Moonshadow snickered a bit and began to speak as if Galin were a child,  &#34;Awww, little blue Dragon hood can&#39;t take any more of the big, bad wolf.&#34; <BR> <BR>Galin pivoted off his left foot and shot a beam of energy from each of his left hands. The beams spiraled around themselves as they wildly flew at Moonshadow. The Terror Dog grinned slightly then, in a blur, was moving around the track again. The beams knocked a sizable chunk out of the wall. About the time Galin turned back around, Moonshadow was sitting on the bench. <BR> <BR>Galin grinned slightly before adding, &#34;Show off.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Yeah, well,&#34; Moonshadow said looking at the back of his paw in a very vain manner, &#34;That&#39;s just me.&#34; <BR> <BR>All of a sudden, Moonshadow saw the big, blue, backhand of Galin coming at him. Naturally, he jumped out of the way and Galin sat down in his place. Moonshadow looked up at the Dragon, who was grinning ear to ear, before adding, &#34;It must suck to be slow.&#34; <BR> <BR>Before Galin could swing again, Moonshadow took off again. Galin shook his head as he laid back and looked at the weights currently on the bar, &#34;500 on each side, pretty strong bar not to warp under that.&#34; Galin thought to himself. <BR> <BR>He began pushing the sizable weight off his chest. After one or two times, he held it up briefly to get a better grip. He tossed the bar into the air slightly and moved his right hand inwards to get a firmer grip on the bar. Right now, he was just benching with his top pair. All of a sudden, all but one of the weights flew off the right side of the bar. The last one teetered on the edge. The 500 on the left, of course, dropped quickly. This catapulted the last weight on the right side across the arena. Galin threw the bar off of him and searched the area around him and, of course, found only Moonshadow laughing hysterically. <BR> <BR>&#34;Moonshadow…&#34; Galin growled. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ha ha ha, that was too rich, the look on your face, Aha ha ha!&#34; Moonshadow said as he lay on his side. <BR> <BR>Then, a loud crash was heard. They both looked to the other end of the facility, where a large window shattered to the steel floor. <BR> <BR>Moonshadow and Galin both glanced at the Jill on the other side as they began standing up from their &#39;dive&#39; position. Moonshadow looked at them for a minute, then back to Galin, who was frowning, big, before saying, &#34;Eh, opps?&#34; <BR> <BR>Meanwhile…In the lab… <BR> <BR>Roketh sat in a rather large chair; the one Grendel used to sit in. Dadge sat in the floor, laughing quietly under his breath as the small Phoenix attempted to fly. A Jill walked up to him and stared down at the bird, which flapped with great determination, &#34;Umm, do our cousins actually do that?&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge looked up at him, a bit dumbfounded, &#34;Cousins?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;You know, the disc stone ones. Grendel used to say that most monsters&#39; intellect is stunned after being in a disc stone. That&#39;s why when they come out, they are taught to fight from birth. That&#39;s why they never rise up against the humans, they never knew any better. Yet, do the disc Jill at this way?&#34; <BR> <BR>Dadge lowered his head slightly and closed his eyes. Then he slowly said, &#34;Yes, some do. Yet, feel comfort that they are happy not knowing any better, plus they are dominant on the battlefield.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Jill walked off slowly. Roketh opened his palm and out two, miniature humans appeared made of fire. They danced slightly, then began to fight. Roketh watched the two kick and punch with speed and ferocity. Then, Roketh clasped his fist shut with blinding speed and smoke shot out from between his fingers, then slowly dissipated into the air. Dadge saw this small display, but stayed silent. Roketh probably had a look running through his mind. <BR> <BR>&#34;Any luck on that Lord?&#34; Dadge asked a nearby Jill. <BR> <BR>&#34;Actually, yes. We are currently stumped on the breed of this DNA sample. You see, we found Azurian&#39;s corpse, and some of the Good Lord&#39;s DNA was in the area. We figure that the Lord was indeed present when Kronock appeared. Possibly one of the Vile Lords. If that is the case…&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;We are doomed…&#34; Dadge spoke silently as he clasped the small bird to his chest when it began tweeting loudly. <BR> <BR>&#34;No.&#34; Roketh spoke quietly, &#34;Not possible.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, do you have any idea of what breed it is?&#34; Dadge asked as he stood. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes,&#34; The Jill spoke as he tapped his keyboard, &#34;He is reptilian. Yet, one thing stumps me. You see, there was a lot of neural fluid, which is found in the monster brain and spinal cord, yet such abundance as this is unheard of. This much would kill an average monster. It is truly dumbfounding. He must have had a huge neck or a huge brain…&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh stood slowly as he had a sickening realization. Dadge looked over to him and asked slowly, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; <BR> <BR>Roketh lowered his head, &#34;Or he had more than one of each.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No…&#34; Dadge said slowly, &#34;It can&#39;t be Vyger.&#34; <BR> <BR>The Jill turned and looked at them and asked, &#34;You know who it is? Good, that makes finding him a lot easier.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Not quite,&#34; Roketh said as he raised his head, tears in his eyes, &#34;He is dead.&#34; <BR> <BR>Meanwhile…Near the Wood Elves&#39; forest… <BR> <BR>Kronock marched along the edge of the forest. He had been fighting off those insignificant elven rejects since he first arrived. None the less, he stumbled upon a few large craters. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ah, the location of my birth.&#34; As he spoke, he raised his hands over the largest crater. <BR> <BR>As he lowered his hands, he turned to face three memorials. He got closer and read what each said. He laughed to himself upon seeing it first hand. <BR> <BR>&#34;Jace, Azurian, and Vyger.&#34; He chuckled a bit more before adding, &#34;Boo-hoo!&#34; <BR> <BR>He continued to laugh as he elevated a chunk of the land. Namely, the earth under Vyger&#39;s memorial. He laughed again as he moved it about ten yards to his left with his powerful telekinesis. He began striping the piece of ground. He eventually cut through the entire chunk, to find nothing. <BR> <BR>&#34;What!?&#34; Kronock became enraged, &#34;Have they actually gotten to the body before me?!&#34; <BR> <BR>Kronock stopped. He remembered he had the ability to see the memories of any that were assimilated into his perfect being. He peered into Dragonaught&#39;s memories. The sight of the last Lord spiraling into the air and being incinerated by the powerful Flame Pulser attack of Dragonaught&#39;s was beautiful. Kronock snapped back to reality and fell out in the most insane laughter imaginable. <BR> <BR>&#34;Yes! Without that Lord, Roketh can not become complete, and will never be strong enough to defeat me!&#34; Kronock screamed with his hands in the air. He lowered them to his side, with a slight chuckle following the rise and fall of his shoulders as he spoke, &#34;Now, now I can absorb Roketh and have the power over all the elements save Good, and I don&#39;t really care for that any way.&#34; <BR> <BR>Meanwhile…back at the lab… <BR> <BR>&#34;What are we going to do? He was incinerated in the final battle with Kingston.&#34; Dadge spoke slowly as he held the now sleeping baby chick. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, we must find a way to resurrect him!&#34; Roketh said with a clinched fist. <BR> <BR>&#34;Any suggestions?&#34; The Jill asked <BR> <BR>&#34;He was destroyed. His body is completely gone!&#34; Dadge was almost screaming, naturally causing numerous cheeps from his hands. <BR> <BR>Roketh closed his eyes and spoke slowly, &#34;There is one thing to do.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;That is?&#34; Galin asked slowly. He and Moonshadow had been summoned and filled in, &#34;How&#39;d he get the Lord of Good anyway.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;His heart was pure, even if he didn&#39;t act it.&#34; Dadge said slowly, &#34;What are we going to do Roketh?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I need his power, more than any. If I can&#39;t get it from him from his body,&#34; Roketh opened his eyes and stared at the ground, &#34;We&#39;ll have to get it from his soul.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>-The last Lord is dead. How will he receive his strength?- <BR> <BR>Stay Tuned! CHB
