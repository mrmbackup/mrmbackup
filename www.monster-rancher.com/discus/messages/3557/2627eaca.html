 Well, here&#39;s the second installment of my story...as always, critisem and comments are welcome. Hope you like it.  <BR> <BR>By the way, anybody have any idea what to name this if i decide to make it longer? Small story isn&#39;t the greatest title... <BR> <BR>Squid <BR> <BR>In the middle of the jungle, Sivan paced restlessly. The mid morning sun was obscured by the canopy of tress, and dappled light filled his clearing, while the corone was contently rolling a small rock around, while muttering under its breath every time the rock got stuck on a root. Above, birds flew by and sang, their melodious chorus bringing the rest of the jungle to life. A huge ape, gray fur caked with dirt, argued angrily with a small leaf hare over the rights to a nut tree, while a tiger slowly stalked a small squirrel.  <BR>The beauty and majesty of jungle life was lost on Sivan. Sprint, his hopper comrade, hadn’t come back yet, and even with the fairy hopper’s penchant for getting into mischief, he normally contacted Sivan after the raids on the caravans when ever possible. Sivan continued his agitated slithering, and hissed as he thought about what could’ve happened to the hopper had the hound saurians caught it.  <BR>	Sivan sighed. While it would be dangerous, he would have to go looking for Sprint. The large naga began moving toward the hollow under the roots where he kept his supplies. He wouldn’t any of the other forest denizens ‘borrowing” his food while he was gone.  <BR>	“Hey Sivs!” Startled by the sudden shout, Sivan twirled around, claws up, ready to fight. And immediately lowered them, a slightly sheepish look on his eyes. “Hello, Sprint.” The fairy hopper jumped down from the tree branch he was standing on, wings fluttering as he landed.  “For a moment there, big guy, I was a bit worried…those claws of yours are sharp, ya know.”  <BR>	Sivan sighed. “You just startled me. I was about to go looking for you.” Slithering away from the storage space, Sivan came to a stop right near the hopper.   <BR>	The fairy hopper laughed. “Awwww…you cared!” Sivan loomed over the small Sprint and fixed him with a glare. “E-Heh…joking, joking.” Sprint backed up a step. Sivan was a pretty nice monster, but he was still a naga.  <BR>	“Anyway, big guy, despite being chased by those zuums, I still managed to snag a couple mangos from the caravan…what did you get?”  <BR>	Sivan ruefully pointed a claw back at his storage hollow.  “Only a bag of spuds and a couple fish…not much of a haul. If only that zuum hadn’t alerted that durahan.” Sivan sighed, and slumped against a tree. “I’m getting too old for this.”  <BR>	The small hopper jumped over Sivan’s head, and landed on a branch right above the naga. “Not your fault, Siv.  And don’t talk like that. You’re still in your pri-AHHHH!”  Sprint screeched as a small rock caught him in the side and sent him crashing to the ground. As Sivan looked on, laughing, Sprint jumped to his feet sputtering at the worm. “You…You…you little…!” <BR>	The corone gazed at him inquisitively, and went, “Puu?” before brushing the hopper aside and rolling its rock away. Sprint sputtered again, then started laughing with Sivan. “Heh…feisty little guy.  Come on, Siv. I’ll get both of you some mangos.” Sivan grinned. It was going to be a good day.  <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR>	“Finally,” said Al-Quim. “Civilization.” The sight of an actual TOWN was a welcome sight to his eyes, but he couldn’t help noticing the fact that the outer wall looked suspiciously like a log stockade. Shaking off his distaste with the place, the short merchant took out his sweat soaked handkerchief, and attempted to wipe his face of grime and perspiration, but failed miserably.  His already dark mood worsened, Al-Quim sighed. “First ambushed on the trail…then running out of bathing water…now having to unload our cargo at this poor excuse for a town…truly a miserable trip!” As the wagon he was on ground to a halt, he jumped off, and quickly scurried to the front of the caravan, where the lead merchants and guard were trying to gain entrance to the town. Not that the log stockade would be much impediment if that durahan and his saurians decided they wanted to get in uninvited. Al-Quim shuddered and ran faster, muttering about what the cost of smoothing THAT over would be.  <BR>	As he reached the gate, he breathed a sigh of relief. The other merchants had managed to obtain entry, and the town’s owners hadn’t attempted to level any extra taxes. Al-Quim started to smile, but then stopped as the durahan strode toward him.  <BR>	The durahan was named Deiaz. He was a master-less mercenary, a monster with the reputation of getting things done rather ruthlessly. He had never fought in the arena, and rarely outside it, due to the fact that his two saurians where loyal to a fault. Al-Quim remembered the tale of a man who attempted to force the durahan to fight in the arena…Deiaz had never thrown a single blow, but they never found all the man’s pieces.  <BR>	Despite the fact that Deiaz didn’t have a master to train him, Al-Quim had to admit that he looked quite impressive. Standing over seven feet tail, the durahan’s armor gleamed brightly, despite the nicks and scars on it. The strange red light that served as the durahan’s eye never wavered or flickered, giving a person the impression that an immovable stare had been fixed upon them…like the one Deiaz was leveling at Al-Quim right now. <BR>	“Ye-Yes Deiaz?” Al-Quim started trembling. Normally monsters didn’t phase him, but all that gleaming metal… “We have not been paid yet, Human.” Deiaz’s answer was totally devoid of emotion, yet Al-Quim was almost shaking in fear of it. “But we lost some cargo-“ Deiaz cut him off with a dismissive gesture. “It was not my fault that your Zuums could not fight off two raiders…nor is it my fault that your zuums did not warn me in time. If they had, my hound saurians might’ve been able to catch them.”  <BR>	Al-Quim had intended to argue, he really had. But something about the durahan…Glumly, he reached into his vest’s pocket and pulled out a bag of coins. “Here.” Deiaz nodded and walked off. Al-Quim sighed. It was one of those weeks….

 Hehe....cool villin. Or he sure seems like one at least. I LOVE the way your word your essays, you seem to make your stories come to life with remarkable results. As in every story, none is perfect. Other than a few typos, the only problem I have is length. Next time you write a story, make sure you have a few hours to yourself, and just let your creative juices flow. <BR> <BR>P.S. Your charactorization is astounding.
