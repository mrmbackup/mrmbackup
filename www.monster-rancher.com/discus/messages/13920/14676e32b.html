 Yeah, I just run around fighting other monsters.  I&#39;ve only just discovered the quest system &#40;which is located in the big building with the treasure chest symbol&#41;.  All of those items we&#39;ve been collecting, if you have enough you can trade them in for gold and...some sort of point system?  I&#39;m not really sure.

 i shrined Monty Phython and the holy grail.&#40;DVD&#41; <BR> <BR>i can say that it depends on the monster silohette at the start of the process, it gave me same stats as Legend of Dragoon &#40;PSX&#41;, if i remember correctly. also in other mr games, ROM Images gave different results than cds, i think. <BR> <BR>not 100% sure on any of this though.

 The Kanji for the one that I put as &#34;Spirit&#34; up there is &#34;Seishin&#34;, literally meaning &#34;Soul, Spirit, Mind&#34;.  I don&#39;t know what kind of stat that translates into, though.... <BR> <BR>OH!  Woops, I skipped one of the stats.  The first one, &#34;Chikara&#34;, is definitely POW: <BR>&amp;#12385;&amp;#12363;&amp;#12425; - POW <BR>&amp;#12363;&amp;#12375;&amp;#12371; - INT <BR>&amp;#22120;&amp;#29992; - SKI <BR>&amp;#32032;&amp;#26089; - SPD <BR>&amp;#19976;&amp;#22827; - DEF <BR>&amp;#31934;&amp;#31070; - Spirit? <BR>&amp;#38598;&amp;#20013; - Concentration? - ACC

 HM... <BR>Apparently, feeding your monster things will give them stat increases.  I fed my &#34;RAIGAA&#34; a piece of meat and all its stuff went up, along with refilling its hunger meter. <BR> <BR>You can get meat from killing random enemies and stuff. <BR>I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a better way of doing it... <BR> <BR>But all edible things have a Red-circle outline in the inventory screen &#40;when you press &#34;I&#34;&#41;.

 I talked to one of the NPCs in the town, and they mention things about what foods to give to what monsters: <BR> <BR>Meat - Tends to be best to develop a Fighter-Type monster, and increases Power the most; <BR> <BR>Fish - Best for Intellect-type monsters. <BR> <BR>Vegetables - Not sure...it says something about how there is an &#34;effect that makes the heart settle,  Recommended for fighting types.&#34; <BR> <BR>Fruit - Great for developing Speed-type monsters. <BR> <BR>Grain - Good for Defense &#40;&#34;Wall-type&#34;&#41; monsters. <BR> <BR>Mushrooms - Not sure, the description translates to &#34;Good and skillful group direction&#34;. <BR> <BR>Milk - For good aim, something about &#34;one-hit shots&#34;...? <BR> <BR>Honey - A fundamental nutrient that will fill the monster&#39;s stomach fully.

 You can buy food from a shop NPC, she&#39;s wearing a dress with an apron.  She asks you a question when you first click on her, if you select &#34;No&#34;, then you go to the shop menu.   <BR>I know of 2 Food NPCs, and they sell different things.  One is in the area with the Training NPCs, the other is in the Windmill area.

 Ah!  Thanks =P  I&#39;m gonna go straight to that NPC the next time I get on...XD <BR> <BR>When you look at the Food descriptions, it kind of becomes apparent that the order they&#39;re listed in <BR>&#40;Meat, Fish, Vegetables, Fruit, Grain, Mushrooms, Milk, Honey&#41; and the stats they correspond to show that they&#39;re in the same order as the stats on your monster&#39;s stat screen.  <BR> <BR>So!  The stat affected most by each food is: <BR> <BR>Meat - POW <BR>Fish - INT <BR>Vegetables - SKI <BR>Fruit - SPD <BR>Grain - DEF <BR>Mushrooms - &#34;Spirit&#34;, I&#39;ll refer to this as &#34;SPR&#34; in the future <BR>Milk - ACC <BR>Honey - Fills hunger.  I haven&#39;t come across honey yet, so I don&#39;t know how it effects stats. <BR> <BR>As you notice, the Mushroom&#39;s description above actually might give a little info on what this &#34;Spirit&#34; stat does...something about &#34;Group direction&#34; makes me think that it has something to do with how responsive or delayed your monster is to your commands or something, but I&#39;m still not entirely sure yet. <BR>I haven&#39;t played some of the later MR&#39;s, though, so does anyone know if there is an analogous stat to &#34;Spirit&#34; in one of the previous games?

Barring the Spirit used to keep your monsters going on Ventures in MR4, which is dependent on your monster&#39;s overall stats, not really. <BR> <BR>Curiously, based on this info, it doesn&#39;t appear that any of those food items affect LIF.

 Ah!  Wow, thanks SilverTwilight-- <BR>I&#39;m going to look at that once I get home from work... <BR> <BR>As far as I can tell, the only way to raise LIF so far is to raise the monster&#39;s level, which happens automatically after you&#39;ve fed your monster a certain amount. <BR>I&#39;d think there would be other ways, though... <BR>If you find any, post them!

 Does battling monsters have any effect on boosting stats? What about learning new techs? <BR> <BR>What monsters are all available at present, and in case you find out through the Wiki, what are the requirements for regenerating other familiar monsters like Golem, Suezo, Mocchi and Worm?

Alright! <BR>Apparently, monsters available at the beginning can only be chosen from the list available when at the shrine &#40;the mid-right exit from your farm--the farm is the place you start at when you login&#41;. <BR> <BR>The only effect of CDs or DVDs is the stats, and personality traits, according to the wiki. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a picture of the monsters that are currently planned to be implemented: <BR><A HREF="../../../../mfo.wikiwiki.jp/indexd57a.html?plugin=ref&amp;page=%C3%E7%B4%D6%A5%E2%A5%F3%A5%B9%A5%BF%A1%BC&amp;src=022.jpg" TARGET="_top">http://mfo.wikiwiki.jp/?plugin=ref&amp;page=%C3%E7%B4%D6%A5%E2%A5%F3%A5%B9%A5%BF%A1%BC&amp;src=022.jpg</A> <BR> <BR>The Listed returning monsters are: <BR>Suezo <BR>Henger <BR>Mocchi <BR>Durahan <BR>Baku <BR>Golem <BR> <BR>Monster Farm Online newcomers: <BR>&#34;GUROBUSUTO&#34; - Grobust? <BR>Salamander <BR>&#34;PENTA&#34; <BR>Thine <BR>&#34;TIANREN&#34; <BR>Lee <BR> <BR>All monsters initially unavailable can be unlocked through Quests and such, I think...But it&#39;s not really clear how they&#39;re unlocked from the wiki...XP  I&#39;ll keep looking, because I want to know too. &#62;&#62; <BR> <BR>-------------------------- <BR>For TECHNIQUES: <BR>Learning techniques is mainly from battles and using your techniques against enemies.  However, learning Techniques require you to be at least a certain level &#40;depending on the technique&#41;. <BR>Regular feeding and battling will allow you to learn the techniques relatively well. <BR> <BR>You can only change what techniques your monster is set to use when you&#39;re in town, outside of a wild monster area. <BR> <BR>-------------------------- <BR>For MONSTER STATS: <BR>After looking at the Wiki: <BR>POW - Directly affects damage from physical attacks. <BR>INT - Affects damage of &#39;int&#39;-type attacks <BR>SKI - Affects attack accuracy <BR>SPD - Affects chance of dodging; Monster movement speed during battle also may be affected. <BR>DEF - Reduces physical damage sustained. <BR>SPR - Reduces &#39;int&#39;-type damage sustained; Affects changes in your monster&#39;s mood &#40;e.g. types of moods &amp; frequency of change&#41;. <BR>ACC - Increases Critical Hit chance, and maybe increased speed of execution of techniques?

 Ah, so two new stats have been introduced, one of them formerly interchangeable with another &#40;Ski and Acc&#41;. <BR> <BR>I can also see Hare &#40;Hamu&#41; there, which has already been established as an MFO monster, along with a few others we haven&#39;t seen for a while. Would you mind identifying which names correspond to which monsters? <BR> <BR>Also, is that lobster-like thing the new Arrowhead? <BR> <BR>Now, about levels. Do your monsters gain Exp from defeating wild monsters? Also, what about the breeder&#39;s own stats? And what of lifespans?

 Apparently, Monster LEVEL is dependent on the totals of all your stats added together.  Level 30 is the maximum level &#40;Total stats &#62;= 2040&#41;; <BR> <BR>There is a stat cap that depends on the TOTAL SUM of your stats &#40;not including Life, which is right under the hunger meter&#41;.  <BR>Max Total Stat sum = 2050. <BR> <BR>So you can&#39;t go 999 in everything.  <BR>Certain foods can lower stats, though, if it&#39;s of the right type, so that you can still change your stats even if you hit the cap. <BR> <BR>Aging is affected by three main things &#40;all of which are the same things that will affect your monster&#39;s hunger&#41;: <BR>-Using Skills <BR>-Sustaining Damage <BR>-Time passing in field &#40;approx 0.1% of hunger meter per minute&#41;

 I think it&#39;s about time you started posting more critical information, like the aforementioned, in new threads. You can start with a summary of stats and levels, and perhaps include how much certain foods increase stats. <BR> <BR>Also, is there any sort of traditional drilling or resting in the game? You can include that, too.

 Alright! <BR>I just wanted to lay out everything first so that I can have as much info as possible in the first post I make. <BR>XP  I wish there was an editing feature, so I can make changes easily... <BR>I&#39;m guessing that if I need changes in a post I made, I&#39;ll have to post a second edited one and ask you about it...? <BR> <BR>&#40;As far as I know, there ain&#39;t traditional drilling/resting, but there still are monster grade tourneys to increase the rank of your monster&#41;

 Excellent. You can make a new thread about that, too. Be sure to address player vs. player battles, and whether or not tournaments have computer-controlled opponents. <BR> <BR>Sorry, but at present, you can&#39;t edit your posts. That&#39;s why obligatory post previews are enforced. However, we might add it later, if it doesn&#39;t compromise the site&#39;s security. <BR> <BR>For the time being, if you have anything new to add, make another post.

 Oh!  CD/DVDs do have some effect on your monster&#39;s appearance. <BR>Though it doesn&#39;t affect the breed, certain CDs are known to create &#34;Special&#34;-colored versions of monsters. For example, the PS &#40;Japanese&#41; version of Monster Farm 1 &amp; 2, when used to unlock a RAIGAA &#40;Tiger&#41;, it will create a Blue/Light Blue Tiger. <BR> <BR>It seems a lot of the special CDs/DVDs are Japanese, though...&#40;but that&#39;d be natural&#41; <BR> <BR>I tried using the English version of Monster Rancher 2 to unlock a RAIGAA, but I only got a normal breed. <BR>&#60;&#60;  Let me know if you guys find any special ones.

 Not all of the monsters listed are available as a low-rank breeder.  You need to complete quests to raise your rank. <BR> <BR>The first quest is available from an NPC standing near &#40;but not next to&#41; the gate in the area you arrive upon leaving your farm.  Speak to him, then go to the gate.  Instead of choosing a normal hunting ground, chose the second tab at the top &#40;&#34;Event&#34;&#41;.  There, you will fight a large pig monster.  When you defeat it and return, speak again with the NPC. <BR> <BR>The second quest involves speaking with the NPC &#40;Yabon&#41; in the area with the windmill.  After obtaining the quest, go to the Event hunting ground again, only this time just speed through it to the exits.  In the final area, you will be instructed to defeat all of the pigs in the area.  When you have, a notice will appear saying that you finished.  Leave and speak to the NPC again, and you will have finished the quest &#40;though, you might have to go to your farm first, and then talk to him, or perhaps my game had an error&#41;.  Then, when you visit the shrine, more silhouettes will be added to the list. <BR> <BR>&#42;Note: the second quest will not be available until you complete the first quest and level up your monster a bit &#40;not sure by how much, if Yabon won&#39;t give you the quest, go level up some more&#41;

 What new silhouettes have been added? <BR> <BR>So in the end, the only way to raise your monster&#39;s stats is to feed it?

 I&#39;m fairly certain that Hamu, Mamu, and Shigue are not available when you first start.  There may be a few others unlocked, but nothing that isn&#39;t already on the list.

On the Wiki, it says the next major update &#40;that&#39;s supposed to happen sometime in April&#41; is when Mocchi will be implemented. <BR>On the official site for MFO, the update sections say that Mocchi will be implemented on 4/15! &#40;So that&#39;s tomorrow!&#41; <BR><A HREF="http://www.mf-online.jp/notice_updateview.aspx?seq=6" TARGET="_top">http://www.mf-online.jp/notice_updateview.aspx?seq=6</A>
