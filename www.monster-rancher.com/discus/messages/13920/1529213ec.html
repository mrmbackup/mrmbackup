This is the challenge that in the future we would like to keep making the community of monster firm together with everyone. &#39;The monster which by the way, also this management &#91;burogu&#93; opens this day raising diary&#39; With the same place is used.

Turning to the place of information interchange of the companion who ventures together from at the time of MFO and, Without being bound as a joint ownership space of the companion who from now on knows each other with the game, to manage freely, way it is possible, Wiki was adopted. Of course, there are times when it keeps expanding the contents depending upon the demand from everyone with future management. But, first, this &#39;monster raising diary&#39; and &#39;breeder firm&#39; as a tool for the community, knowing in everyone, introduction such as the point which we would like to receive we would like to keep doing. &#40;There is also chat of course and is don&#39;t you think?&#41; <BR> <BR>About the official member sight Well, this day as for the official member sight which is opened &#39;the monster raising diary &#40;Blog&#41;&#39; with &#39;Breeder firm &#40;Wiki&#41;&#39; has become the main contents, Other than the game pot the game may be a certain chat bulletin board does not exist.
