This guide is to help you get started, and to give you a few basics about the game. <BR>This doesn&#39;t cover how to set up the game installation and VPN, however!  If you need help with that, the &#34;About Log-in Troubles...&#34; thread is the place to look. <BR>A great deal of this info is thanks to the <A HREF="http://mfo.wikiwiki.jp/" TARGET="_blank">Monster Farm Online &#40;MFO&#41; wiki</A>! <BR> <BR><U><FONT SIZE="+2">TABLE OF CONTENTS</FONT></U> <BR> <BR>1&#41; Getting Started - Creating a Monster <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;i&#41; Types of regeneration <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;ii&#41; Monster types available at start <BR>2&#41; Orienting yourself <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;i&#41; The Map &#40;key &#39;L&#39;&#41;&#44; Important Locations <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;ii&#41; Vendors and NPCs <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;iii&#41; The Quest System <BR>3&#41; Your Monster <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;i&#41; Status Screen &#40;key &#39;M&#39;&#41; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;ii&#41; Raising Stats <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;iii&#41; Techniques <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;iv&#41; Aging <BR> <BR>=========================================== <BR> <BR><B><FONT SIZE="+1">1&#41; Getting Started - Creating a Monster</FONT></B> <BR>The moment you finish creating your character and enter the world, you will appear in the middle of what seems to be an empty field surrounded by some fence.  A person will be standing in front of you, and introducing you to the world of Monster Farm Online--this place you start at is your Farm! <BR>It might look bare now, but you&#39;ll be able to purchase upgrades later on as you earn more money. <BR> <BR>Once you finish clicking through their dialogue, you can head out of the fence and to the Shrine, the mid-right exit lined in white. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s time to receive your first monster! <BR> <BR><B>i&#41; Types of regeneration</B> <BR>When you enter the shrine, there will be four options on the screen with two available &#40;the last one is to leave&#41;. <BR> <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#34;Regeneration&#34; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#34;Item regeneration&#34; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#34;Transmigration&#34; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#34;Fusion&#34; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#91;Exit Shrine&#93; <BR> <BR>&#34;Regeneration&#34; is normal regeneration either using an in-game Stone Slate, or using a CD/DVD. <BR>&#34;Item regeneration&#34; may be the creation of a monster with the assistance of an item; <BR>&#34;Transmigration&#34; is transferring the crystal of an old monster that you have raised into a new monster &#40;which doesn&#39;t have to be the same species&#41;.  Some fraction of stats can be retained.  To create a monster crystal, some quests will have to be completed. <BR>&#34;Fusion&#34; is the fusion of your monster with another player&#39;s monster. This feature may not have been implemented, as there are no records of people having used it yet.  <BR> <BR>Right now, you will only be able to do the first, as you do not have any items or monsters yet. <BR>When you select the first option, press the left option &#40;&#39;Yes&#39;&#41;, and it will give you three options: <BR> <BR>--CD/DVD Regeneration-- &#124; --Stone Disk Regeneration-- &#124; --Cancel-- <BR> <BR>In this game, CD/DVDs will not give individual monsters! <BR>You will choose the breed of your monster yourself; the only thing that CD/DVDs will effect is the stats of the monster, their personality traits, and possibly if they are a special breed. <BR>You also start with one Disk, but if you&#39;ve got CDs, I suggest using those.  The stats on your CDs/DVDs would likely be better than the default Disk stats that you start with. <BR> <BR>&#40;The Disk you start with, as far as I know, will always be an Antelo&#41; <BR> <BR><B>ii&#41; Monster types available at start</B> <BR>-<A HREF="../../../../mfo.wikiwiki.jp/indexede1.html?plugin=ref&amp;page=%C3%E7%B4%D6%A5%E2%A5%F3%A5%B9%A5%BF%A1%BC%2F%A5%A2%A5%F3%A5%C6%A5%ED%BC%EF&amp;src=a1.png" TARGET="_blank">Antelo</A>: A Monster that learns Lightning/Ice techniques, relatively well balanced overall. <BR>-<A HREF="../../../../mfo.wikiwiki.jp/index8676.html?plugin=ref&amp;page=%C3%E7%B4%D6%A5%E2%A5%F3%A5%B9%A5%BF%A1%BC%2F%A5%B3%A5%EB%A5%CC%A1%BC%BC%EF&amp;src=ko_01.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Korunu</A>: A Monster that learns Ice/Earth techniques; built to have high physical power. <BR>-<A HREF="../../../../mfo.wikiwiki.jp/index2d68.html?plugin=ref&amp;page=%C3%E7%B4%D6%A5%E2%A5%F3%A5%B9%A5%BF%A1%BC%2F%A5%E9%A5%A4%A5%AC%A1%BC%BC%EF&amp;src=r12.png" TARGET="_blank">Tiger</A>: A Monster that learns Lightning/Ice techniques; a good physical attacker with quick movement. <BR>-<A HREF="../../../../mfo.wikiwiki.jp/index505e.html?plugin=ref&amp;page=%C3%E7%B4%D6%A5%E2%A5%F3%A5%B9%A5%BF%A1%BC%2F%A5%AD%A5%AD%A5%E2%BC%EF&amp;src=20080301-003029.PNG" TARGET="_blank">Kikimo</A>: A Monster that learns Fire techniques; a long-range combat specialist. <BR>-<A HREF="../../../../mfo.wikiwiki.jp/index5521.html?plugin=ref&amp;page=%C3%E7%B4%D6%A5%E2%A5%F3%A5%B9%A5%BF%A1%BC%2F%A5%D4%A5%AF%A5%B7%A1%BC%BC%EF&amp;src=5646.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Pixie</A>: A Monster that learns Fire/Lightning techniques, and has high intelligence. <BR>-<A HREF="../../../../mfo.wikiwiki.jp/indexab41.html?plugin=ref&amp;page=%C3%E7%B4%D6%A5%E2%A5%F3%A5%B9%A5%BF%A1%BC%2F%A5%CF%A5%E0%BC%EF&amp;src=%A5%CF%A5%E0.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Hare</A>: A Monster that learns Wind/Earth techniques, and has great skill and speed. <BR> <BR>---------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR><B><FONT SIZE="+1">2&#41; Orienting Yourself</FONT></B> <BR>Right after you create your monster, you will be taken back to your farm.  You should head to town now, which is the mid-left exit &#40;with the brown gate&#41;.  Choose any of the channels that you&#39;d like to enter. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll be taken to the town chief, who will offer to give you a tutorial. &#40;&#34;Yes&#34; will be the left choice, &#34;No&#34; will be the choice on the right--this is always how the Yes/No menus will be placed&#41;. <BR>Taking the tutorial is a great way to get used to the battle controls if this is your first time. <BR> <BR>In the Tutorial, you will be pitted against a giant doll that looks like an enormous Mew.  It&#39;s motionless and doesn&#39;t attack, but has massive amounts of HP &#40;compared to how much damage your monster does&#41;, but if you&#39;ve got patience, you can actually kill it and it may drop an item. <BR> <BR>Once you&#39;re done, you can head out of the tutorial area. <BR>You will come back to the town, where the Town Chief will talk to you a little bit more, and then will ask you whether you want a Potion &#40;you can say &#34;Yes&#34;, left choice, to receive a free one&#41; and he will also give you a piece of Food.  You can begin exploring now! <BR> <BR><B>i&#41; The Map &#40;key &#39;L&#39;&#41;&#44; Important Locations</B> <BR>You will start in the &#34;Town Hub&#34; of sorts. <BR>You can see the map by pressing the &#39;L&#39; button on the keyboard. <BR> <BR> <BR><B>ii&#41; Vendors and NPCs</B> <BR>Several Vendors and NPCs are available, and here is a quick list of known Vendors/NPCs. <BR>&#40;See Map for locations&#41; <BR> <BR>There are two currencies: <BR>SP - Normal money <BR>MP - Money that can only be purchased with a credit card/etc from their site at http://www.mf-online.jp/ . <BR> <BR>-Food Vendor: Sells various types of food for your monster. &#40;Food sold is initially only Rank 1/2 Food&#41; <BR>-Medicine Vendor: Sells potions &#40;HP restoring, Status recovery, etc&#41; <BR>-Farm Object Vendor: Sells things that can be placed on the farm. <BR>-Clothing Vendor: Sells clothing and accessories for the breeder. <BR>-Monster Accessory Vendor: Sells clothing and accessories for your monster. <BR>-Quest Vendor: Where you accept and turn in quests. <BR> <BR><B>iii&#41; The Quest System</B> <BR>Quests are how you increase your breeder rank. <BR>BP &#40;Breeder Points&#41; will be received when you complete a quest for the first time, along with some SP. <BR> <BR>You can repeat quests as many times as you want, but you will only get SP from then on. &#40;BP can only be gained from completing new quests&#41;. <BR> <BR>The Quest Vendor has 3 options when you click on them: <BR>-New Quest <BR>-Turn in Quests <BR>-Cancel <BR> <BR>When new Quests are accepted, you will be able to keep track of them in the Quest menu &#40;the 6th option on the menu to the left, or press the &#39;O&#39; key&#41;. <BR> <BR>---------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR><B><FONT SIZE="+1">3&#41; Your Monster</FONT></B> <BR>Now we&#39;ll talk about your monster! <BR>The small portrait on your top left contains your Breeder name, the picture of your monster, the Name, Level, and Life bar. <BR> <BR><B>i&#41; Status Screen &#40;key &#39;M&#39;&#41;</B> <BR>When you press &#39;M&#39;, it will bring up the Monster&#39;s status screen. <BR>I&#39;ll explain each of the entries: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Name<br>Species<br>Level<br>Grade<br>Age &#40;Year/Month/Week&#41;<br>Height<br>Weight<br>Body Type</TD><TD>Condition<br> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Hunger Meter<br>Life </TD></TR><TR><TD>POW<br>INT<br>SKI<br>SPD<br>DEF<br>SPR<br>ACC</TD><TD>Characteristics</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>POW - Higher POW will increase the damage done by Physical Attacks <BR>INT - Higher INT increases damage done by Magical &#40;Int-type&#41; attacks <BR>SKI - SKI will increase the hit rate of your monster&#39;s techniques; it also increases chance of inflicting status effects for skills that do inflict status effects. <BR>SPD - Increases the rate that your monster dodges attacks; also increases their movement speed during battle. <BR>DEF - Decreases the amount of damage taken from Physical Attacks. <BR>SPR - Decreases amount of damage taken from Magical &#40;Int-type&#41; attacks, and also affects the types and frequency of changes of your monster&#39;s moods. <BR>ACC - Increases the chance of a critical hit, and may also affect the execution speed of techniques. <BR> <BR><B>ii&#41; Raising Stats</B> <BR>The way a monster&#39;s stats increase is by feeding them food; when your monster is hungry, you can feed them for a better effect than when they are almost full.   <BR> <BR>After its stats increase a certain amount, your monster will Level Up, and you will gain some life and will be able to learn some new techniques. <BR> <BR>There are also 8 Food Types available, each of which affect certain things: <BR> <BR>Meat - Increases POW the most <BR>Fish/Shellfish - Increases INT the most <BR>Vegetables - Increases SKI the most <BR>Fruit - Increases SPD the most <BR>Grain - Increases DEF the most <BR>Mushrooms - Increases SPR the most <BR>Milk - Increases ACC the most <BR>Honey - Will fill monster&#39;s hunger fully, and will also affect all stats. <BR> <BR>Certain foods will tend to change the Color of your monster, too: <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Red</FONT>: Salmon, Carrot, Mushroom, certain Meats <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Blue</FONT>: Crab Meat, White Turnip <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Green</FONT>: Green Fruits, Vegetables <BR><FONT COLOR="ffff00">Yellow</FONT>: Fruit, Grain <BR><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">Purple</FONT>: Purple Vegetables and Fruits, and some meats <BR> <BR>Each of the food types also falls into sub-categories of nutrients, which determine how they will affect your monster&#39;s weight: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD><B>Nutrient</B></TD><TD><B>Food Types</B></TD><TD><B>Effects</B> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Protein</TD><TD>Meat&#44; Grain</TD><TD>Body will grow. </TD></TR><TR><TD>Lipid</TD><TD>Meat</TD><TD>Will cause monster to become fat. </TD></TR><TR><TD>Vitamins</TD><TD>Fish&#44; Vegetables</TD><TD>Will help maintain body weight. </TD></TR><TR><TD>Minerals</TD><TD>Mushrooms</TD><TD>Enhances growth of Monster Horns. </TD></TR><TR><TD>Sugars</TD><TD>Fruits&#44; Honey</TD><TD> Will make monster happy&#44; but is fattening and stunts growth.</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR><B>iii&#41; Techniques</B> <BR>There are four total &#39;ranges&#39; available to techniques: <BR> <BR>Short - usuable in the red range of distance <BR>Medium - usable in the yellow range of distance <BR>Long - usable in the blue range of distance <BR>Extreme - usable outside the blue range &#40;when the circle around your enemy is white&#41; <BR> <BR>Techniques can be learned as your monster continues to battle and level up &#40;you must be at a certain level to learn some techniques&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;d like to set one of your techniques to a shortcut, you must first be in Town or at the Farm, and open the Skill menu &#40;key &#39;K&#39;&#41;, and drag the skill to a box in the lower right that matches its range. <BR> <BR><B>iv&#41; Aging</B> <BR>Your monster will age as they get hungry, so in a way, your hunger meter bar &#40;right above the Life bar on the monster status screen, key &#39;M&#39;&#41; is the same as your monster&#39;s aging measure. <BR> <BR>Monsters get hungry from 3 main things: <BR>1&#41; Using Techniques <BR>2&#41; Getting damage from enemies <BR>3&#41; In-game time passes &#40;about 0.1% of the hunger meter depletes every minute&#41; <BR> <BR>Lifespans and Life patterns vary for different monsters, but not much is known about them yet.
