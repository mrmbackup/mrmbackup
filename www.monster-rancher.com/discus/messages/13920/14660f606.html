 Are you running Easy2Game or VPN?  There is an IP ban in place, so that only those accessing the game from a japanese server can play. <BR> <BR>After that, you&#39;ll need to set your game&#39;s resolution one step down from your desktop, and then make sure that your graphics card meets the requirements of the game &#40;listed on the mfo site&#41;.

 You need to run separate software to mask your IP address and fake the servers into thinking that you are in Japan. You need Easy2Game or VPN running before you start the MF:O software.

 You should have enabled your VPN client adapter which you must&#39;ve done to see the &#34;network cable is unplugged&#34; message and then you right-click on the VPN icon on the taskbar and go to Start VPN Connection and pick the one you&#39;ve setup.

 I connect through a modem, too, and you can set up your VPN adapter by following the directions from that onrpg.com thread I posted.  I think the instructions you need are on pg 1 and pg 9 or 10

 The error message that you posted is just symbols, it&#39;s not Japanese. You might need to install Japanese support. <BR> <BR>The notice from the official site just says that there is a bug in the game that may cause food to spoil when you move from your farm to the town.

 I&#39;m not sure what problem you might be having; <BR>I&#39;ve been using the VPN client &#40;English version&#41; with the settings by TheLetterB posted earlier in this thread, and I&#39;ve got them working fine. <BR> <BR>The fact that the login menu disappears and nothing happens might indicate some problems with video display or something for your computer &#40;what&#39;s your CPU RAM?  And what&#39;s your video card?  You can check RAM by right clicking on &#34;My Computer&#34; and choosing &#34;Properties&#34;&#41;

 No, if you didn&#39;t have Japanese fonts installed all that would happen is that instead of kana and kanji, you&#39;d see lots of random letters and boxes.

 I think it depends, I was using a different graphics  card before, and while it would let me into the game, it would not let me into the town and would shut down/freeze

 I would like to thank Lisa, LetterB and Spooky first off for showing me how to get onto MFO.  It took a little doing, as i havn&#39;t played Japanese MMOs before so it was a new networking experiance, but the combined information and suggestions got me online and playing with-in an hour.

 Never give up, Never surrender!  lol. <BR> <BR>Well star, try starting over and double checking all you tools and settings.   <BR> <BR>First uninstall your current copy of the game.   <BR> <BR>Regional language uni-codes under your control panel - Regional and Langs.  In the advanced tab, make sure it&#39;s set to japanese &#40;If not, set it and reset your box&#41;&#40;&#40; may require you to input your Windows disc for language codes&#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t reinstall MFO until you&#39;ve checked more stuff. <BR> <BR> <BR>Then get your VPN Tool up and running properly.   <BR> - I am using PacketiX VPN Client Manager Ver. 2 <BR>    &#40;this is the program that LetterB posted an image of&#41; <BR> - Go with this VPN because we KNOW it works for this. <BR> - With this VPN when you install and load you&#39;ll be givin a split screen, the top frame has a &#34;Make new connection&#34;  activate that. It may ask you to create a VPN adapter is you don&#39;t have one installed, do that. <BR> - Next when creating the connection use the following settings. <BR>     -  Destination VPN Server box put <BR>           Host Name:vpn.mobilefree.jp <BR>           Port: 443 <BR>           Virtual Hub Name: GUEST <BR>     - User Authentication setting <BR>           Pull down to &#34;Anonymous Authentication&#34; <BR>           Username: GUEST <BR>Then finialize your setup. <BR> <BR>Now install MFO <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t forget to try your logon username and password on the MFO website, if they fail their get another account registered. <BR>Thats all i got.

 Good for you!  I am unfortunately having some trouble with my computer completely shutting down on me when I try to play some big games...but it tends to do that from time to time, so its a problem on my end. <BR> <BR>Go and have fun!

I&#39;m running into some trouble with MFO as well. I downloaded the Japanese text ie_ja.exe so I can see characters correctly. And I found a site to download VPN. I have Softether VPN 2.0 and I got it to run off the information given by DarkHawk. And I have an account that works on the MFO site. And I downloaded and installed MFO.  <BR> <BR>I get one of two errors when trying to connect to MFO.  <BR> <BR><A HREF="../../../../i304.photobucket.com/albums/nn176/alternativemoth/Error.jpg" TARGET="_top">http://i304.photobucket.com/albums/nn176/alternativemoth/Error.jpg</A> <BR> <BR>And I tried it without having VPN running and I get <BR> <BR><A HREF="../../../../i304.photobucket.com/albums/nn176/alternativemoth/Error2.jpg" TARGET="_top">http://i304.photobucket.com/albums/nn176/alternativemoth/Error2.jpg</A> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know what either of these are saying, so I don&#39;t know what either of these are telling me. So I can&#39;t assess what&#39;s wrong. So if anyone could help, that would be grand.

 After a long hiatus &#40;in which my old computer was rendered unusable&#41; I am back and trying to play again.  Unfortunately, I can only just get into the Town Server, walk a few steps, and then the game client has an error and shuts down.  Anyone else have this problem &#40;or even a solution?&#41;

 :facepalm: <BR> <BR>Ok, I don&#39;t know how I managed this, but I accidentally deleted my character.  Upon creating a new character and meeting my helper for the first time, the game kicks me out as soon as I try to scroll through the text.  A reboot, re-installation, and new character creation didn&#39;t help at all.

 I actually took the graphics card from my old computer &#40;which ran the game well&#41; and installed it in this one.  Before I did this, all of the human models looked transparent. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try playing with resolutions, though.

 Still no luck.  With the updates from the last maintenance it takes longer for the error to occur &#40;the program pauses for a bit before client.exe has its error&#41;, but still cannot play. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to try installing the game on another computer &#40;if my brother will let me, that is&#41;

 New problem: installed/reinstalled game on a comp with Vista, now I can only run the launcher when it installs, and then can&#39;t open it ever again.  Even when I tell the computer to &#39;allow&#39; it &#40;I added all of the relevant files to the &#39;allow&#39; list&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyone else have problems with Vista not opening the game? &#40;when I try to use the shortcut, it says it doesn&#39;t exist, and then doesn&#39;t allow me to use the actual client.exe file&#41;

 I went and got my rygar back &#40;trying to turn him blue with food!&#41;.  Already got him up to lvl 2, and he&#39;s learning techniques quickly &#40;probably because I actually know how to play this time around&#41;. <BR> <BR>Hey, has anyone figured out what those &#39;extra&#39; moves are/how to use them?  The ones that appear in the green/purple tabs of the moves list?   <BR> <BR>And...turns out the game only works on my brother&#39;s computer.  Which he will be taking back to school in a week.  Oh well.  At least I can play a little bit before he leaves.

 i think those extra moves are healing or can be used from two ranges just click on it and place it in a range and then you can use it
