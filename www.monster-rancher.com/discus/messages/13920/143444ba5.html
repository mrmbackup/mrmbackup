Awesome link!

Development direct hit interview Network Trial Opinions, 2007/07/27  <BR>  <BR>This is GM. Hello, everyone!   <BR>Finally towards the end of July, it&#39;s as though aheavy helping of heat has decided to visit!  &#40;Actually, this has already been said.&#41;  <BR>  <BR>About the opinions and requests of the network trial in Japan, I believe we have received comments from the TECMO development team.  <BR>  <BR>Well, as for the one being given the Japan comments, the TECMO Monster Farm  <BR>development team is iuchi.  Glad to meet you!  <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>Glad to meet you too!  <BR>  <BR>Even if it&#39;s early, since opinions and requests from everyone have been  <BR>introduced, iuchi-san, please respond.  <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>&#39;Roger!&#39;  <BR>  <BR><B>I want to be able to change the size of the chat window.</B>  <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>In the GM event, this caused confusion. Actually, I too was mixed up like  <BR>that breeder. To change the chat window&#39;s size, the answer is to increase  the log line numbers &amp; width.  <BR>  <BR><B>Please increase the level of difficulty a little.</B>  <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>The level of difficulty is already a current adjustment topic. It&#39;s not  just about making it more difficult or simpler, we&#39;re also making progress  in adjusting the noticeable form of &#39;risks vs. returns.&#39;  The effectiveness of good training, also development during battle in order to become stronger, satisfying battle with your monster are becoming possible.  <BR>  <BR><B>In clothing shops, etc., I want to be able to try on clothes.</B>  <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>The trying-on-clothes function is a necessary addition.  <BR>  <BR><B>I want to go into the system that opens the interval between stray monsters and  <BR>your monster.</B>  <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>A module about the techniques of the system is planned.  Conversely, there is already a technique for filling up the interval.  <BR>  <BR><B>As for the tournament, I want to set the opening at the same rank as the pair &#40;?&#41; like in the consumer edition&#39;s rank battles.</B>  <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>We&#39;re in the middle of considering a system that can set the degree of the person&#39;s rank and the battle.&amp;#65533;  <BR>  <BR><B>I want a manager &#40;like Colt or Holly&#41;</B>  <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>Perhaps, just possibly, it could be said we&#39;re in the midst of considering an assistant, sort of like Colt or Holly.  <BR>  <BR><B>It&#39;s difficult to maintain distance during battle; it almost feels like  <BR>your opponent&#39;s movements are toying with you.  Advancing with GO and returning with in personal battle mode has been eliminated.   <BR>Maintaining battle posture after shifting position should be made easy, or  <BR>the method by which the player shifts position during battle mode probably  <BR>isn&#39;t good.</B> <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>We are adding to our improvements relating to operability and camera management.  Included in the plan to change self operability, currently we  <BR>are considering adding on various methods.  For operating breeder and monster characters at the same time, we are making improvements to the best  <BR>of our abilities to bring to life skillfully the operability distance belt. &#91;note: distance zone between player and monster?&#93;  <BR>  <BR>Again, about battle, we received a lot of other opinions.  When we look at the testers&#39; feelings, depending on the tendencies of the monster chosen,  <BR>the impressions are completely different.  When close-range types &#40;korunuu, etc.&#41; were chosen, &#34;The game is easy,&#34; they said.  When long-range types &#40;deinashaa, etc.&#41; were chosen, &#34;The game is hard,&#34; they said.  <BR>  <BR>This was a low level test, and so the first period skill was very limited. A few close range types were adjusted for the advantage.  &#40;Deinashaa perhaps had a thorny road.&#41;  <BR>  <BR>After this, the enemy&#39;s type and adding skill, rather than the merits or demerits of each distance zone standing out, we are adjusting/adding to the game so that it should become more about doing battle and strength, offense and defense pertaining to skills combination/distance zone, the cooperation of a party, etc.  Of course side by side with doing  <BR>battle and strength, the important key word is raising.  <BR>  <BR><B>Since Monster Farm from the beginning was basically a raising game, it would be wrong to raise only through battle.  If you choose the practice menu when you don&#39;t log in and practice those contents, I want the ability cost to extend simply. <BR>  <BR>With other games I want the feeling of completion to be different.   <BR>Before this test, even though I was diligently hunting, actually I thought  <BR>it was ordinary.  In this game, I thought it was insufficient that the status increased by hunting.  I think that most of the effort should be in  <BR>raising at the farm.</B> <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>We received many viewpoints and feelings about &#39;raising methods&#39;. As for the game this time, in order for everyone to enjoy raising, we put in raising by battle as an important point.  But, that is not to say that there are no other raising methods, so please don&#39;t worry.  <BR>  <BR>There are also methods for raising at a peaceful farm, which was perhaps one policy, but not the only one.  That said, if there is only battle, in the style that this slants all the parameters, there are various raising methods, and we&#39;re in the middle of developing it such that you can establish your own &#39;raising policy&#39; by combining several raising methods. <BR>  <BR>While in town, breeders are not thinking of raising,but actually various  <BR>changes can occur to monsters.  If its stomach is empty, it eats.  Parameters also?  Anyway, walking around with monsters can be said to be  <BR>equal to raising, perhaps. <BR>  <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <BR>  <BR>Time over!  <BR>  <BR>Even more viewpoints were received, but today it&#39;s just these, please excuse  <BR>us.  Iuchi-san, thank you so much, you did a great job.  <BR>  <BR>Development @ iuchi  <BR>No, no, I think I want to complete a good product by consulting with  <BR>everyone&#39;s viewpoint. <BR>  <BR>This means that in the midst of things, everyone in the development team is  <BR>doing his best.  So that it becomes an interesting product, everyone please  <BR>support them.  <BR>  <BR>Well then, that&#39;s today&#39;s development blog.  This was GM.

 Once again, very informative.  <BR> <BR>It looks like they&#39;ll be mixing some things up this time. Boosting  <BR>stats by both hunting and training, among other things, seems  <BR>like an interesting way to go abouts things. Battles also seem to  <BR>be getting more complex, so it&#39;s nice to see they&#39;re working hard  <BR>on improving the camera, which tends to be the hardest element  <BR>to work with. I&#39;m keen on that. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m quite pleased with how they&#39;re considering an apt ranking  <BR>system in lieu of the console games &#40;E-S&#41;. I wonder what the new  <BR>rank-up requirements will be? Perhaps an overall statistical level  <BR>range/achievements? Then again, they did mention  <BR>tournaments, so it&#39;s probably the PvP matches. Having to fight in  <BR>PvP tourneys to raise your rank definitely sounds a lot more  <BR>interesting than facing set ranked opponents. <BR> <BR>To note, that guy wasn&#39;t me.
