 the following is something i posted on m-r.com last night, that i want to follow through on.  it is my belief that maxing monster stats cannot be done through simple raising &#43; generations of hearts;  there must be some advanced drilling method involved as well.  let me know if you think i am offbase with this belief, or with this analysis. <BR> <BR>generations cannot lead to high stats. the training method is the only key to maxing a monster. <BR> <BR>let&#39;s do the math. assume you get a monster with 995 out of the encyclopedia or a disc. this would be extraordinarily high...such a monster might not exist. but humor me, assume 995. &#91;you&#39;ll see why in a minute&#93; <BR> <BR>then assume that you &#42;already&#42; have a maxed monster. &#91;a real bootstrap argument, i know - how do you get a maxed monster? assume you already have one!&#93; this would mean your next monster, the 995 monster, gets an additional 1000 points from the heart. <BR> <BR>so the new monster, the one we are now going to try to max, has 1995 total points from a combination of the heart and starting stats. that still leaves 3000 points to gain from drills, battles and ventures until the monster is maxed. <BR> <BR>this is where i need help. my latest colorpandora was enormously effective in training during prime. i did a double hard drill that drove int down, then a hard drill that did the same, then a life drill. the darling cp did great after great, helped along by the expensive durables and a liking for vine grass at 2/4. since my int was already at 1, i gained 30 &#43; 20 &#43; 15 = 65 for almost 2 yrs doing things this way. 2 yrs of prime, drill, drill, drill, rest. <BR> <BR>but that is only 1435 points gained. a person trying to max out all stats could not train this way, because he/she wouldnt have run a stat down to 1. further, the rest of the time, not in prime, because of low statgain and failures, i only gained a total of 1100 more points from non heart/starting stat sources. i thought i was doing pretty good to gain 2500 points for my monster. <BR> <BR>so, i would appreciate it if anyone claiming to have maxed a monster would go into a little more detail about your training method - things like, do you have the expensive durables? how often do you rest? do you reset for failures? how often do you battle? how much ran ran do you buy on ventures? do you use items or accessories? that would be extremely helpful to me as i try to learn more about maxing monsters.

 I really only have one question about this.  Hoiw are you getting 30&#39;s from training.   I&#39;ve raised close to 20 monsters and have never seen a stat gain of over 20....

 good point, perrin - what i mean is cumulative.  for example, on blowfish in goat, you get &#43;20 spd, &#43;10 pow and -5 int, for example, in prime.  since my int was down to 1, i didn&#39;t take the hit, and i then added the &#43;20  to the &#43;10 to get my &#43;30.

 hmmm..... well, one way to improve stat gains &#40;I believe&#41; is to train monsters that seem to get good stat gains early in life and then evolve them into monsters that get good stat gains later in life &#40;like evolving a Dragon/Goat into a Dragon/Brillia&#41;.  That might help...

 unquestionably.  however, what i am looking for in this thread is not so much verbal ideas, but the numeric result of carrying out those ideas. <BR> <BR>what has been a typical month in the life of such a monster you&#39;ve trained, dark dragon?  or, more to the point, a month early in life in a pre-evolution stage and also a month in prime, after evolution?  what kind of numbers from what kind of drills are average?  maximal?  three drills and a rest every month, like my cp, or something different?

 Well although I do not own this game, I will give this my go... <BR> <BR>We all know what DigiMoshiMogi has been doing &#40;hope that&#39;s right&#41; and at 3 years he&#39;s pretty close to having a maxed monster, problem is, the average monster lifespan is 4 years and he&#39;s probably already out of prime.  So if he&#39;ll make it is extremely questionable, so doing his method a second time &#40;I don&#39;t quite remember if the monster he&#39;s using now had a heart crystal&#41; should result in a maxed monster.  Now combining this with the fact that the monsters can be evolved into monsters that have better stat gains during that period of life I&#39;d say this puts you pretty dang close.  Now getting all the moves and getting them to their maximum strength, that could be problematic.  One thing that everyone needs to start research on &#40;I seriously apologize for saying SOMEONE needs to do this and not doing it myself but lacking the system and game I cannot&#41; is items.  Now there HAS to be some life extending items, especially if there isn&#39;t items that relieve fatigue and stress.  So my suggestion, we need to get to research on items... of course maybe that strategy guide already has this information in it and I&#39;m just rambling.  I know we already have SOME information on the items, but what we really need is some actual research done to find out ALL of the effects of the items.  Seeing as how Lisa and Torey are constantly researching everything and others are just using the info &#40;not all of you&#41;... I&#39;d suggest at least some of you people who use the info help gather it. <BR> <BR>Any volunteers?

 well, unlike in mr2, mepersoner, where there were 2 items &#91;gold and silver peach&#93; which directly gave you increased lifespan, there do not seem to be any such items in mr3.  furthermore, the items readily available through mucchi on a weekly basis, unlike mint leaves and nuts oil &#91;which had a readily identifiable effect on stress and fatigue&#93;, do not seem to have a readily available effect on stress and fatigue.   <BR> <BR>so there you have it.  the game has only been out a month, if people keep playing it, and report anything interesting they find regarding stress and fatigue, that would be extremely helpful.

 I&#39;m aware of that fact Torey, but it seems as though there would HAVE to be one or the other, if not both. The items may have changed in appearance or name, but something similar must exist... at least one way or the other.

I have done the math to disprove being able to max out all five stats. <BR>Ok, I&#39;ve read that you get 20% of the dead monster&#39;s stats passed on. Lets say that you only passed the monster heart to the same &#34;clone&#34; monster from the encyclopedia. Just for explaining purposes, lets say that the monster begins with a nice stat total of 500 points and that it gains 2500 points in its lifetime. Together that is 3000 and 20% of that is 600. Give the heart to the same monster and 500 initial &#43;2500 gained &#43;600 inherited equals 3600. If you repeat that you get 3720 and then 3744. <BR>If you were to check you would see that there is a pattern: <BR>3000 &#43; 3000 x.2   =3600 <BR>3000 &#43; 3000 x.24  =3720 <BR>3000 &#43; 3000 x.248 =3744 <BR>Then you would see that .2 x.2 =.04 and .2 x.2 x.2 =.08. So the pattern is: <BR>.2 =.2 <BR>.2 &#43;.2<SUP>2</SUP> =.24 <BR>.2 &#43;.2<SUP>2</SUP> &#43;.2<SUP>3</SUP> =.248 <BR>it would continue like: <BR>.2 &#43;.2<SUP>2</SUP> &#43;.2<SUP>3</SUP> &#43;... &#43;2<SUP>n</SUP> <BR>where n would be the number of hearts used. <BR>After about 4 or 5 hearts, the percent levels off to about 25% and doesn&#39;t get any higher. So to acheive five 999 stats &#40;a total of 4995&#41; you need to find the number of beginning total points &#43; the points gained in its life &#40;lets have that number be &#34;p&#34;&#41; so that p&#43;.25p=4995. That is the same as saying 1.25p=4995, thus 4995/1.25 and p=3996. <BR>So to get all stats maxed, you need to first find a way to get a monster without any hearts to have a total point score of at least 3996 when it dies. <BR>Good Luck!!

 yep - hearts alone can never be the secret to maxing.  however, take heart! &#91;yuk yuk&#93; training methods are developing which can fill in the blanks...
