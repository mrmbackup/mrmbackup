 When my monster &#40;hare&#41; died, it was horrible and torturous. A question that might not be so great of help is: Is there any monster that dies without looking like he&#39;s feeling the worst thing in the world?

 Henger doesn&#39;t look THAT bad. <BR> <BR>BTW, NEVER let a Karakarakkung &#40;Ducken/Takrama&#41; die. It spits out a &#34;skull&#34; and it&#39;s eyes roll out of it&#39;s skull.....

 the deaths are so melodramatic.  what makes them even more entertaining is fleria&#39;s one tenth of a second of mourning before she cheers up and says &#34;off to the shrine to get another!&#34;

 Yeah, I agree with torey. I mean in MR2 Colt cried much more and you could have a funeral, and to tell you the truth I liked the music more, too. In MR3 Fleria acts like nothing happened&#40;well almost, she cries for like a second and then says something like what torey said&#41;and BTW it seems she was HAPPY the monster died. OK, so not really, but she should have more respect.

 Well, you DO get a heart when your monster dies, and your old monsters don&#39;t get too much stats, so it is a little bit real if you were happy your monster dies, but in MR2 you lost a very important part of raising. You can&#39;t combine a dead monster, you see? Gameplaywise, it is fully realistic.

 And if you like Fantasy novels, the death of a Durahan is _VERY_ saddening. He thrusts his sword up into the air one final time like he was the last man left on the battlefield, before collapsing onto the blood stained earth... <BR> <BR>Oops, sorry there. Got carried away.

 In MR2, dying was just going to sleep and never waking up.  I was sad when my Gaboo, named Gaboo, died, I cried just a bit but I was happy to see his spirit going up to the big monster ranch in the sky.  My Metanix in MR3, R2D2, was like Gaboo.  He was sooooooo strong, but I liked him for who he was, not because he made one-hit victories.  When he died, &#40;He was my only MR3 monster to have died&#41; I gave his heart to a new Metanix, R2D2 Jr., who got to rank B faster than R2D2.  R2D2&#39;s death didn&#39;t look too bad, but I don&#39;t recall exactly what happened.

 I just want to throw in my eleven-year late two cents, Fleria actually IS happy when the monsters die! She&#39;s all, &#34;It&#39;s sad we won&#39;t see him anymore, but instead of letting him rest in peace, we&#39;ll keep brooding on it and get a new monster!&#34; And then she does this giddy little smile thing. Of all the things I like about MR3, I can&#39;t stand Fleria. At all. <BR> <BR>Rant. Over.
