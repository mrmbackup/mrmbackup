 Alright, I&#39;m now halfway through my third monster, and I&#39;m starting to notice stuff.  Just to note: I&#39;ve got the Glowing Rock, Golden Goblet, Herbal Incense, and Medicine Box.  Anyway, I trained my first two monsters, a Pixie/Morx and a Raiden/Morx &#40;both in Morx&#41;, on a schedule of never letting them get even &#34;a little bit tired&#34; if I could help it.  This usually meant only two weeks of light drills or one week of heavy drills before a week of rest.  I&#39;m giving my Gitan/Brillia &#40;training in Brillia&#41; a contrasting system, now that I have these items, of getting in three weeks&#39; worth of drills before resting.  He&#39;ll get to &#34;a little bit tired.&#34;  However, I noticed one thing- I can go to the status screen, and sometimes I&#39;ll get an image of him just floating along there, and sometimes he&#39;ll be crawling on the bottom of the screen, obviously exhausted.  I never pull him out to the point where he&#39;s crawling &#40;only on the status screen, weariness doesn&#39;t seem to change their on-ranch animations&#41; if I can help it, and so far he&#39;s hitting his life stages about 10-15% later than my other two monsters.  They hit each stage exactly on or the week before their birthdays.  This guy was about two months beyond his first birthday when his first growth spurt came, and between 3-4 months beyond his second birthday for the next spurt.  Also, I should note that I haven&#39;t had the weight problem with him that I&#39;ve had with my other two- he&#39;s been normal since I started this regimen, and they were always gravitating towards chunky. <BR> <BR>Also, obviously, his stat acquisition is much more efficient.  This leads me to believe this is the way to go...but I admit there&#39;s other mitigating factors.  For one thing, I&#39;m feeding him food that he really, really likes every month, though making sure that nutrition on the food is up to 4 or at least 3 before doing so.  This may be reducing his stress significantly.  Also, I&#39;m not battling him very much...though this has two sides, because he&#39;s not losing lifespan from combat, but not losing stress from it, either.  Also, I&#39;ve been telling him &#34;As Expected&#34; on every Great, which seems to be helping his success rate tremendously in comparison to his predecessors, and I&#39;m also using the predictable nature of the drill successes to make sure that if he&#39;s destined to fail on a week, he&#39;ll be taking that week off for R&amp;R anyway.  In any case, I&#39;m really looking forward to the results of this.  Does anyone else have any comments, advice, comparable experience, or contrasting experience?

 these are good concepts, nate.  when i finish my current pixie, i will have a decent pow and int heart on ice, in the person of a monster.  then i want to run a dual monster track something like you describe.  based solely on my experience to date, i think it is possible to extend your monster&#39;s lifespan slightly with careful raising...but i fear that the additional rest, especially during prime, comes at too great of a statistical loss. <BR> <BR>i also want to look into the dreaded reset.  failures are much more common in this game.  lisa has reported that failure weeks are destined to be failure weeks, no matter how you try to redo the drills.  your idea of locating failure week patterns, and scheduling rest during those weeks is intriguing. <BR> <BR>the reports i have read about maxing monster stats have been sketchy and unhelpful.  they just say &#34;i have a 22d generation beaklon&#34; or &#34;i give my monster a heart, and use a lot of hard drills&#34;, without going into detail as to the mechanics involved.  i want to begin to construct, in my own mind, and on this board, a week by week blueprint for maximizing a monster&#39;s potential.  you have already given me considerable food for thought; any further insight by you would be invaluable.

Great info, Nate!  Just the stuff we need to move along. <BR> <BR>I just finished my third monster and am starting a Marsala &#40;Durahan/???&#41;.  With this one, I am training in Brillia &#40;mainly because I haven&#39;t trained there, yet&#41;.  I did give him a heart that boosted his stats from a combined 575 to 954, a boost of 379.  Here is my Plan: <BR> <BR><B>Initial Growth Stage</B> <BR>- 2 Regular Drills / Rest <BR>- Battle: every non-Festival &#40;not many, I know&#41; <BR>- Food:  Vine Grass every month.  It provides both full nutrition and is tops in the favorites. <BR>- Tourney/Battle Response:  &#34;As Expected&#34; <BR>- Great Response: &#34;Great Job!&#34; <BR>- Ventures: 1000g Ran Ran, 2 Noisey Halls, explore <BR> <BR><B>First and Second Growth Stages</B> <BR>- 3 Regular Drills / Rest <BR>- Battle: every tourney I can win.  Festivals as I deem the monster capable to advance. <BR>- Food:  Vine Grass every month.  It provides both full nutrition and is tops in the favorites. <BR>- Tourney/Battle Response:  &#34;As Expected&#34; <BR>- Great Response: &#34;Great Job!&#34; <BR>- Ventures: 2000g Ran Ran, 3 Noisey Halls, explore <BR> <BR><B>Final Growth Stage</B> <BR>- 2 Regular Drills / Rest <BR>- Battle: every non-Festival &#40;not many, I know&#41; <BR>- Food:  Vine Grass every month.  It provides both full nutrition and is tops in the favorites. <BR>- Tourney/Battle Response:  &#34;As Expected&#34; <BR>- Great Response: &#34;Great Job!&#34; <BR>- Ventures: 1000g Ran Ran, 2 Noisey Halls, explore <BR> <BR>Durables: Glowing Rock, Silver Goblet, Herbal Incense, Medicine Box.  No others will be purchased during this monster&#39;s lifetime. <BR> <BR>ATM, the Eon Kyrs, the Durahan, is still in his initial growth stage.  Once he get to his first growth stage, I am going to duplicate the save so I can re-live his life and vary the second and third stages of his life. <BR> <BR>One of the things I like about this monster is that it has numerous favorites for food.  So, when I go to relive it&#39;s life, we may be able to see exactly what type of effects Vine Grass &#40;which is very medicinal&#41; may have on it&#39;s life. <BR> <BR>If I go to relive it&#39;s life a third time, I will keep the Vine Grass, but go for just 2 Regular trainings / Rest through out it&#39;s entire life. <BR> <BR>Since, I will not be working with this monster until tonight, please provide me any feedback that I may add or use to modify the training regimen.

 this is an excellent blueprint for monster raising, and i will be very interested in seeing how the monster responds. <BR> <BR>the only thing i am wondering about is the ambitious battle schedule.  i have every reason to believe &#91;another way of saying i have no proof, but i want to believe it anyway&#93; that even the easiest of battles loses you a week of lifespan.  are you trying to earn money; get to know the foe; just like to battle in this game; something else?

 Well, I like battle and so does the Durahan.  Gotta keep the monster happy!  8^&#41; <BR> <BR>But, I also want to earn money.  However, I want to maintain my normal training schedule as much as possible.  That way I am less likely to make mistakes.  In future reincarnations of this monster, I can vary the battle regimen as well. <BR> <BR>Personally, I have a strong suspicion that Vine Grass may be similar to Tablet.  But, that&#39;s just me blowing in the wind.

 I don&#39;t think it would be as healthy to give him constant Vine Grass, simply because it would be unbalanced.  I also have a Hengar who gets four blocks for nutritition and favorite in Vine Grass, but since he gets the same for Nuts, I alternate between the two just to make sure that his diet doesn&#39;t go off-key.

 I&#39;d be interested to know what kind of life-stage lengths you achieve with your method. I happen to be raising that very monster at the moment, and his first life stage was 1y 2m &#40;2000 Ran Ran, 3 Noisy, explore; two combats, one wild, one rival; all vine grass; great = as expected; battle = as expected &#91;highly dependant on opponent strength, for the rival battle the monster was &#34;a little stronger&#34; so I gave him an &#34;as expected&#34;&#93;; accessories: wing ornament, head jewel&#41;. He received a heart piece &#40;4 gens, 3 Raidens and a Joker&#41;, that gave him a bunch of stuff including Iron Heart &#40;one of the best skills I&#39;ve come across--slightly reduces training fatigue&#41;. <BR> <BR>You may or may not be interested to know that the Masala &#40;and, I expect &#40;but don&#39;t know&#41;, all of the cloaked Durahans&#41; can recieve &#34;Illusion Cape&#34; &#40;notably off the MRBC2 Joker/?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, be sure to post the stage lengths, eh? I&#39;d love to see how yours turns out.

a minor breakthrough - my first 3000 composite point monster.  thanks to the people in this thread, and thanks also to lisa shock, john hawley, psych0midget, superbkato and djinnmaster for contributing ideas as well. <BR> <BR>now the details.  having heard her 4th birthday song, and seriously entering the &#34;death spiral&#34; of statgain, she will not live another month.  she is cordero my angel &#91;evolved into a night flyer&#93;.  her final&#91;almost&#93; stats: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>lif</TD><TD>pow</TD><TD>int</TD><TD>spd</TD><TD>def </TD></TR><TR><TD>710</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>992</TD><TD>955</TD><TD>375</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>she started life as an angel - and had serious/bad as scrolling box every time she rested.  at her birth, i traded in the 25,000 stone and got the 125,000 one, to go with my 125,000 goblet. <BR> <BR>first year, i raised in brillia.  first 6 months, did int up/pow down drill and life up drill.  fed her most nutritious and liked food - usually nuts, sometimes peaches.  rested at looks a little tired.  only battle was the E lvl official at the end of her first year.  failed a little less than 1/3 of the time, mostly in her first couple of months.  did &#34;as expected&#34; for great/win; alternated between &#34;try harder&#34; and &#34;keep at it&#34; for failures.  raising style went to hard/hardest; she developed chronic stress problem. <BR> <BR>2d year, i gave her a headband and my suzurin&#39;s heart, then moved her to kalagari.  battled her more often - rose to b level in 2d year. only did enough ran ran to go to noisy halls.  continued to have chronic stress problem, although her serious nature caused her to almost never fail.  consistently did life risk &#91;spd up big,lif up little, pow down&#93; and waterfall &#91;int up, pow down&#93;.  pow reached 1 during this year. <BR> <BR>3d year, she evolved into a night flyer.  her stress problems were over - raising style became normal immediately upon evolution.  however, she failed more often, especially at life risk.  i did a little reset thing - 4 months in a row, i was fullof energy at the festa time, i saved and tried life risk.  the first two times she succeeded, so i went on training her; the third, she failed so i reset and went to battle.  i continued to do this the rest of her life.  she reached s level on her 3d birthday.  she also found a jade orb after a battle at one of the &#34;bad feeling&#34; spots &#91;the back of the waterfall&#93; even though fleria did not say she had a bad feeling before the battle. <BR> <BR>4th year.  I needed some money, and she was failing more often, so i battled a lot in s level invitationals.  i only skipped one, because she got a great at life risk.  by now my int was nearly maxed, so i substituted the def up, int down drill for my second drill after life risk. <BR> <BR>despite the disparity in activity, training style and stress levels, every stage lasted a year, with only a week or so worth of difference either way.

Excellent work, Torey! <BR> <BR>Well, Eon Kyrs, my Marsala, has just finished his first year of training.  I kept extensive notes &#40;for me&#41; and have published them on <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/varthlokkur27/mr3ek101901.htm" TARGET="_top"> Eon Kyrs&#39; Notebook</A>.  Please feel free and check it out. <BR> <BR>Heres the synopsis: <BR> <BR>I changed the training local to Takrama for I feel it better suits the Marsala.  Other than that, I followed the regimen I posted above for the initial Growth Stage.  The training focused on Power and Defense while trying to maintain the basic levels of Speed and Intelligence of the monster.  Training progressed steadily with what I would call the standard progression during the first year&#39;s grown &#40;&#43; 5s to &#43; 15s&#41;. <BR> <BR>Eon Kyrs fought in every non-Festival battle, five in all.  In each case, it won with no losses and no more that 50% LIF loss.  I still suffer with Post-Battle Response Syndrome.  And, when I finally said the right thing, it grows and wants a different response. <BR> <BR>Food consisted exclusively of Vine Grass, which I&#39;m sure lead to Eon Kyrs being a Gourmet.   <BR> <BR>The Durahan reached his first Growth Stage at 1y 1m 2w &#40;or is it 1w&#41;.  This is pretty standard for my monsters, so no abberation is noted.  I do not beleive anything done so far has negatively impacted its growth.  Along with Gourmet, Eon Kyrs changed from Difficult to Stubborn. <BR> <BR>Overall, total stat gain is 276 &#40;L &#43;9, P &#43;135, I &#43;0, S &#43;10, D &#43;122&#41;. <BR> <BR>My next set of goals is to raise Eon Kyrs to C-Class, gain a fourth Tech, and get a combined stat gain of 480.  I am anticipating 26 weeks of training, 6 weeks of battle and 16 weeks of rest. <BR> <BR>Other than a breif update, I won&#39;t have the results until Monday.

 ya, djinn - at the beginning of year 2.  it added 550 or so points to her stat profile, heavy on int &#91;200&#93;, spd &#91;160&#93; and lif &#91;120&#93; and no power whatsoever.

I had a Durahan/Goat that evolved from a desert one that had 95 wins and 5 losses. This monster lived for almost <B>5 years!</B> I mean this was good for me since he raised over $100,000! he was stressed in the begining of his life for about 2 months but otherwise had no health problems.

 it is my belief, based on some proof, but not enough to say with certainty, that any battle loses you one week of life, no matter how easy it is.  it may also be that battles you lose or get ko&#39;d in lose you more; more work needs to be done in this area.

 Well, once I finish with the Marsala, I can re-run those 4 or 5 years with much less battling.  Then, we will know.

 my basis for the above statement is a rerun of the last 4 months of a monster&#39;s life, first with battles, then with no battles but regular training, then with just rest.  there was no difference between the training to a little tired/all rest parallel universes; there was exactly a one week per battle diiference for the battling monster.   <BR> <BR>variables left uncontrolled is whether this only applies in old age, or in all stages...whether losing and/or being ko&#39;d increases the week of loss &#91;my old guy was a crusher against game monsters - many of them gave up, and the rest were ko&#39;d fairly quickly&#93;...whether there are any foods/accessories/items that could affect this. &#91;i used no accessories or items on any of the reset trials&#93;.

 I&#39;ve done some research on the reset thing.  If someone else found this already, I apologize.  The failure chance seems to be set at the end of the previous turn.  I got around this by keeping two saves, and alternating between them.  When I run into a failure week, I can go back to the previous week, do the last successful week again, and then have a new chance at success again. <BR> <BR>ie:  <BR>week 1 succeess.  Save 1 <BR>Week 2, success, save 2 <BR>Week 3 failure, reload week 1, and try again. <BR> <BR>Week 2 will be a success, and some of the time week 3 will be a success as well.  When I went to a 3 save system it worked even more often. <BR> <BR>-Berge

Well, I finally did some more work on Eon Kyrs.  You can check out the data at <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/varthlokkur27/mr3ek102401.htm" TARGET="_top"> Eon Kyrs’s Workbook</A>. <BR> <BR>Eon Kyrs, a Marsala &#40;Durahan/???&#41;, is now just a tad over three years old.  A tad is a smidge over four weeks.  Anyway, the initial growth stage &#40;infant, baby?  What is this?&#41; lasted 52 weeks.  The second growth stage &#40;adolescences, the teen years?&#41; lasted 50 weeks &#40;remember, 48 weeks in a year!&#41;.  Eon Kyrs has not entered the third growth stage &#40;gramps, elder?&#41; but I would assume that should occur within the next 4 to 6 weeks. <BR> <BR>One interesting experiment that I touched on briefly was failing a training.  I happened to save just beforehand.  So, I decided to try some different things. They were &#40;in order&#41;: <BR> <BR><UL><LI>Rock Push Training – Fail <LI>Rock Push Training – Fail <LI>Black Pearl - Rock Push Training – Failed <LI>Scorpion Claw - Rock Push Training – Fail <LI>Cactus Training – Fail <LI>Sand Swim Training – Fail</LI></UL> <BR> <BR>I stopped after this because I hate reloading.  The items used were just what I had hanging around.  Eon Kyrs loved the Black Pearl and hated the Scorpion Claw. <BR> <BR>Another interesting occurrence is when I started saying “As Expected” for great trainings.  The monster responded with a very satisfied.  In addition, that kicked off a string of greats for training.  14 out of 20 trainings were great with no failures.  7 in a row &#40;not counting rest&#41;.  I was rather impressed with that. <BR> <BR>I cannot think of anthing else to add at the moment. But, please add any questions on comments.  Once Eon Kyrs dies, I am going to re-run it but with different training parameters.  Though, I do not know what they will be yet.

 John Hawley has recently done some research on the failures, and I will let him post his findings. Yes, resetting for failure does not appear to work, they tend to fail no matter what. But, John seems to have been able to successfully break those streaks of failure. <BR> <BR>I also noticed when looking at the &#34;talk&#34; feature when opponents show up some tips about failure. I can&#39;t remeber exactly who said these comments &#40;it was either the blonde woman from Brillia who has the hat and coat, or the red haired woman with the scarf as a headband&#41; but two comments spoke of a monster needing &#34;willpower&#34; or it would fail. I wish there was a willpower meter...

 I noted Berge&#39;s info above.  However, that method would be waaaaaay to cumbersome for me.  I&#39;d just accept the Failure if I have to maintain two consistent saves.

 Failures are hard to break. It will cost you a week of stat gains, but if you fail you lose a week anyway so... <BR>  <BR>Failures appear not to be based on Fatigue alone. I&#39;ve had a Failure immediately after Resting. This would seem to indicate that Stress also triggers Failure and Stress does not clear with a single Rest. &#40;I only have the 25000 Durables right now. Might be different with the more expensive Goblets, whatnot.&#41; <BR>The only way I&#39;ve found to break Failure streaks is to Rest. If you are coming out of a Rest and can&#39;t win a tournament or Fail on a drill, back up and Rest again. Resting the first Failure week seems to reset the counter for Failure. And, yes, you can come right out of a Rest and Fail, so you have to Rest again. Boy, do we need to find our &#39;Mint Leaves&#39;. <BR> <BR>Still very early days so YMMV.

 Another thing I&#39;ve noticed while trying to get a baseline for a Nymph &#40;1 year, 2 months, 2 weeks between Noisy periods&#41;. Getting unbearably bored during one runthrough, I fought one &#40;1&#41; tournament. The monster came out &#34;is a little tired&#34;. This monster had its next Noisy at 1 year, 2 months. Apparently, Battle not only costs 1 week of lifespan, so does &#34;is a little tired&#34;. <BR>Battle= -1 week. <BR>&#34;is a little tired&#34;= -1 week. <BR>Just a thought to keep in mind while training. The Nymph? It ran 4 years, 9 months and 2 weeks with the 25000 Durables. Three times with the fourth being the battle-loss Pixie. <BR>Again, YMMV.

 i now have the most expensive durables in every category.  i still run into failures immediately after rest.  most of them are in old age or babyhood.  but at least once in every monster&#39;s life, i come off a string of greats, or a smashing tournament victory, etc...and still have a failure following a rest. <BR> <BR>my mileage did differ in the one little 3 month test i ran a while back.  the guy who rested lived the same length of time as the guy who trained to the point of being a &#34;little tired&#34;.  it was only the battle guy who lost the week for the battle. <BR> <BR>maybe a certain number of &#34;seems tired&#34; trigger a week loss, and you hit the end of that string.  or maybe sometimes they do, and sometimes they dont, based on other variables.  or maybe i have looked at lifespan loss from both sides now...and i really dont know lifespan loss at all.

 Be hard to do with a Pixie that is only resting, Torey, but one in-game message I got while running this series was about letting your monster get too tired for too long and losing life. Maybe the extra stress of losing the tournament counted towards the necessary &#39;tired&#39; state to kick in the life loss?

 the other variable in the inconsistent findings is the stage of life they were in - perhaps being a little tired costs more in youth or prime than it does in old age.

Okay, Eon Kyrs has run his course.  He has been my most successful monster so far.  Go to <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/varthlokkur27/mr3ek103101.htm" TARGET="_top"> Eon Kyrs&#39; Diary</A> to see all the particulars of his training. <BR> <BR>Now that this is done &#40;and I&#39;m about to be laid off&#41;, I can re-run Eon Kyrs and start to play with his training.
