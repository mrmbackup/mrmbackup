 Lisa has done a lot for Tecmo... at least, that is what I gather from what I know about her and this site. It says thanks to Lisa in the game?

Well, I got involved a while back, when I started moderating the Tecmo Forums. I typed up, and sent in the suggestions people had posted for MR3.  <BR> <BR>I was also lucky enough to have the developers choose two of my ideas for custom rare monsters to be made for the US version: Fay &amp; Eega. I corresponded with the art department a bit, getting the monsters to look just right! <BR> <BR>Then I bought Monster Farm 3 when it came out, and started playing. Tecmo asked for suggestions again, and I was able to give them some tips &#40;like have the ability to save while in town, and have the ability to skip drill animations, as well as showing them that PC games froze the shrine&#41; on their message boards. Then they started calling me at home for advice while they worked on MR3, which would ship 6 months later. For about a month I played the game along with the official testers, on the phone for 4-6 hours a day to each other. &#40;The US testers don&#39;t know much Japanese, and don&#39;t know much about ranching.&#41; <BR> <BR>While MR3 was in development, for several months after the MF3 release, Tecmo people would call and ask me questions, and when I could, I answered. I managed to submit a couple of bug reports, and found one tournament opponent monster with a Japanese name that would be offensive if used in English. The also hooked me up with the authors of the Prima guide, and I translated the game for them so they could play it. &#40;They don&#39;t know any Japanese!&#41; I spent two and a half weeks working full time for Prima. <BR> <BR>I also posted here at MRM about my progress in the game, so gamers could learn about the game. I was recently ordered to stop posting at the monster-rancher.com ezboard, because I dared to say that the game didn&#39;t have combining -and I described the heart system! &#40;Fade insisted that he had a copy of the game beta, and that combining was part of it! Richard Ryley emailed me and told me not to post unless I had solid proof of what I was posting.&#41; They also accused me of not being able to read Japanese when I pointed out the cover of the MF3 strategy guide said the game has 201 monsters. &#40;more were added to make 222 in the US version, but these people were conned into thinking there were going to be 600&#43; monsters, and didn&#39;t believe me...&#41; So, I was pretty much stuck posting here at home, but that was just fine with me!
