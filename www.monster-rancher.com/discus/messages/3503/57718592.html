 I noticed some errors and I thought I&#39;d make them apparent. <BR> <BR>1.&#41; p. 36 Scissors picture is under Avalanche and Scorpi is under Scissors and Scorpi, as for Avalanche, well he isn&#39;t included. <BR> <BR>2.&#41; p. 38 Under Colorpandora is another picture of Marimba. <BR> <BR>Please, if you can find any other errors, add to this post.

 knowledge is power, jesta.  the strategy guide, although not needed &#91;as you so colorfully point out&#93; is a handy item to have to accompany the game.

 You wouldn&#39;t believe the number of mistakes i found in the beastiary when i read through it! Not counting the obvious ones that were already mentioned. And these are simply the ones i noticed, there is probably many more i didn&#39;t notice! <BR> <BR>1. Baku&#39;s personality at birth should read honest, not obedient. <BR>2. Avalanche&#39;s personality at birth should read stubborn, not combative. <BR>3. Colorpandora&#39;s personality at birth should read nice, not normal. <BR>4. All of the Gitans species has slow listed for growth type, this is an inconsistant with the rest of the guide. <BR>5. Kakao&#39;s personality at birth should read cheerful, not weird. <BR>6. Sandlessie&#39;s personality at birth should read honorable, not pride. <BR>7. Hibis&#39;s personality at birth should read cheerful, not aggressive. <BR>8. The word &#34;late&#34; is spelled as &#34;lake&#34; for Diamante&#39;s growth type. <BR>9. Offshore&#39;s personality at birth should read independent, not cool. <BR>10. Tigre&#39;s personality at birth should read combative, not independent. <BR>11. Blackie&#39;s personality at birth and characteristics should read childish, not frivolous. <BR>12. Breeza&#39;s default life stat should be 110. not 119. <BR>13. Lovina&#39;s personality at birth should read refined, not normal. <BR>14. Pixie&#39;s personality at birth should read indignant, not obstinate. <BR>15. Coconut&#39;s personality at birth should read cheerful, not weird. <BR>16. All of the Raiden species has fast listed for growth type, which is inconsistant with the rest of the guide. <BR>17. Usazo&#39;s personality at birth should read timid, not normal. <BR>18. Fukazo&#39;s personality at birth should read touchy, not normal. <BR>19. Maririn&#39;s personality at birth should read modest, not normal. <BR>20. Seniorin&#39;s personality at birth should read cheerful, not aggressive. <BR>21. Palasaulo&#39;s personality at birth should read calm, not normal. <BR>22. Hotrod&#39;s personality at birth should read combative, not difficult. <BR>23. Gramper&#39;s personality at birth should read difficult, not combative. <BR>24. Afro has aggressive listed as a personality at birth and cheerful as a characteristic, but it is impossible for it to have both as both aggressive and cheerful are personality traits, and a monster cannot have two at the same time. <BR>25. Grilief has &#34;NM&#34; listed as its growth type. I believe the guide means normal. <BR>26. The beastiary completely left out Planekkung, Fay, Tigon, and Eega. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your time.

 Note on your #26; <BR> <BR>Planekkung is the same as Denkung, it&#39;s just listed with its Japanese name instead of the US name.  <BR> <BR>Eega, Fay and Tigon were rares made exclusively for the US game, based on suggestions made by fans at Tecmo&#39;s website. They don&#39;t exist in the Japanese game at all. The authors of the book only had the Japanese game to go by when writing the book. There was no playable &#34;gold&#34; version of the US game at all. The first time anyone &#40;reviewers, testers, etc.&#41; saw the US version was when it hit stores. I believe that the Japanese developers programmed them in very late in development, after the August deadline for the book to go to publication.

 Thanks for the correction Lisa, i didn&#39;t realize that. I do have a question though: Are there any monsters that were only in the Japanese game? Maybe that is why nobody can find a cowbird? just asking

 Raiden, Ogyo and Gitan were not in the Japanese game at all either. I personally never found a monster that is not in the US game.  <BR> <BR>However, I think that Ragna was a playable monster in the Japanese game, because the US guide was written using the Japanese guide as a template. And because of some things I saw on a Japanese site.

 In the US game, the completed encyclopedia fills the entire screen with monsters. Since the Japanese game has no Raiden, Ogyo, or Gitans, does it actually not fill up the screen? <BR> <BR>In any case, the fact that the Japanese game doesn&#39;t contain Raiden, Ogyo, or Gitan explains why there are no in-game saucer stone pieces for those monsters. I suppose it was over-looked or deemed not important enough with the time restraints of the US release.

 STRATEGY NOT STRAGEDY OR STRADEGY!!!!! oh wait manatee said that already. <BR> <BR>As  for stats, they can vary, so the guide isn&#39;t wrong, just using official data.

 The book was written under a deadline, with no copy of the US game available. &#40;There never was a playable full US beta version.&#41; Tecmo gave Prima a copy of the Japanese game &#40;which is different from the US version&#41;, and a Japanese guidebook in late August &#40;the game shipped September 24&#41;, with the expectation that the book hit store shelves at the same time as the game. Printing does take about two weeks after the book is written.  <BR> <BR>So, with about 2 weeks to write it, and conflicting information, the authors did the best they could.
