 Yesterday, i set out with the intention of finding out if defensive characteristics &#40;stone body, hard scales, thick fur, tough skin, and armor&#41; were stackable; meaning that their effects complimented each other, thus reducing damage even more. I discovered that when you give a monster that already has one defensive characteristic a heart of a monster with a different defensive characteristic, nothing happens. The additional characteristic that would have come from the heart does not transfer over.  <BR>In addition to that, they would not transfer over to a jell with jell body. Yeah, i really wanted a jelly stone body with a thick fur coating and armor. <BR>As a side note, stone body did replace tough skin on a Beaklon.  <BR>If anyone has gotten a monster with 2 or more defensive characteristics, possibly from ventures, please let us know.

 Hey, I have a Ruin Sector &#40;Durahan/Kalaragi&#41;named Tokyo with Armor, which &#34;reduces damage from attacks but has a hard time dodging.&#34; However, I gave it my Magi &#40;Joker/???&#41; named Scythe&#39;s monster heart and it picked up the skill Illusion Cape, which &#34;makes dodging easier.&#34; So, which characteristic is dominant?

 I think Shin, that they both kind of even out as a little boost in both DEF and SPD. Altough if you only had, lets say, Armor, it would greatly increase your DEF and there for drop your SPD. Personally, I like having something that increases DEF and something for SPD.  <BR> <BR>You know, on your theory DB, I think that maybe you got something there. Even if it was another characteristic, like some that increase SPD or something like that. &#40;if there are any others than Fast Footwork&#41;. But maybe, if they did&#39;nt cancel each other out, then I think that the effects would double, triple, etc. Keep researching and you might have something here. Especially for some of you Tank lovers.

Here is my initial testing results. Be advised, this is only with one tech that has only been used 20 times &#43;/-2. But even if i&#39;m not done, I figured i&#39;d give a bit of a taste and to hopefully inspire thoughtful comments that could help my testing.. More to come at a later date.  <BR>Monsters used in testing. <BR>Defenders <BR>Control-300 in every stat, chars-high output, form normal <BR>Yojimbo-300 in every stat, chars-armor, form normal. <BR>3Amigos-300 in every stat, chars-tough skin, armor,form normal. <BR>Attacker <BR>Pike, 860 int &#40;have to look that up again&#41; <BR>My tests were done using the tech Thunderbolt at tech level 1 after aquiring 99 guts with Pike. Crits were not included in calculations, nor were any attacks made if any change in battle status occured. All means were rounded to the nearest whole number. <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD> Mean</TD><TD>Mode</TD><TD> Highest</TD><TD> Lowest</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Control</TD><TD> 117</TD><TD> 109</TD><TD> 133</TD><TD> 103</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Yojimbo</TD><TD>105</TD><TD>100</TD><TD>118</TD><TD>96</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>3Amigos</TD><TD>91</TD><TD>76</TD><TD>119</TD><TD>72</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>These results aren&#39;t final yet &#40; i want to have it so that thunderbolt was used 40 times&#41;, but you can see with the exception of 3Amigos&#39;s highest damage, there is a downwards trend. How effective it is is yet to be determined &#40;more techs to test&#41;, and harder. The higher damaging techs vary a <B>lot</B>. I&#39;ll also try to get a monster to 3 defensive chars for testing purposes as well. Another thing i&#39;m concerned is that it may just chose the best defensive char from the bunch, which would mean testing more 1 defensive char monsters. But its easy enough, so i&#39;ll get around to it. Comments and questions are encouraged.

 so far so good, but i am curious to the monsters breeds. I would think the breed would need to be the same, but again, i may not be right.

 nice start db - certainly, there is enough there to conclude that def chars have an effect.

 well done DB! i am curious to see how thunderbolt hits a monster with insulation, it should cause no damage right? <BR> <BR>Also, i would also like to see if the dodging rate also differed between a monster with armor and one with thick fur, for example. Perhaps one tech lowers dodging ability more than the other.

 that&#39;s right, sf - i almost forgot.  none of these def chars come for free - they all supposedly reduce dodging ability, don&#39;t they?

 Some of them do, but if you want to avoid that you can use Fast Footwork, etc. But then that DEF would drop again because it drops DEF but makes dodging more effective.

 I haven&#39;t been keeping track with dodges, but I have gotten frustrated at all 3 monsters when they kept on dodging again and again. That will be something i try when i test a tech besides thunderbolt. Currently i have no plans to test for the differences between the defensive techs, but my goal is to see if I can stack several of them onto one monster with with their defensive effects combined.

I have finally finished my research on whether they can stack. The answer is most definately yes. I&#39;m now working on getting a monster with 3 defensive characteristics, and will save its vs. data when it has 300 in every stat. <BR>The three &#34;test&#34; subjects are the same, the attacker is now Pokylyps using his maxed slap at 99 guts. I also tested pike&#39;s thunderbolt another 20 times per monster, but i think pokylyps&#39;s slap is more revealing. <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Mean</TD><TD>Mode</TD><TD>Highest</TD><TD>Lowest</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Control</TD><TD> 409.5</TD><TD>408</TD><TD>416</TD><TD>405</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Yojimbo</TD><TD>304.4</TD><TD>304</TD><TD>319</TD><TD>295</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>3Amigos</TD><TD>240</TD><TD>237</TD><TD>252</TD><TD>233</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>As is clearly visible, the defensive chars make a big difference. As for misses, out of 25 attacks on control, 3 missed &#40;2 crits&#41;, no misses on yojimbo out of 22 attacks, 1 miss on 3amigos out of 21 attacks. So nothing can really be proved, needs more trials. I also tried poky&#39;s rockslide briefly, and got a big damage reduction as well, although the damage range varied more. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll be extremely happy when i get 3 defensive chars on a monster. And then on to four, although i can only think of one monster possible right now that i think i can make have 3. If anyone has a monster in their encylopedia with a defensive char that isn&#39;t normal to that monster &#40;ie: a lesione that has stone body, a mew that has thick fur&#41; please tell me. Thanks

 Ok, i know i said i was finish, but I&#39;m not. I just got a monster with 3 defensive chars. In addition, i plan on testing a maxed monster with 2 defensive chars vs. Pokylyps, and one with 3 vs. Pokylyps. Since the upper levels of stats are what matter to me &#40;since thats the level of competition online&#41;, i&#39;m curious to see exactly how much of a difference stacking defensive chars would make with maxed monsters.
