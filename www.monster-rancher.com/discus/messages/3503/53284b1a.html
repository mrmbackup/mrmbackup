 I don&#39;t know if any of you have experienced this yet, but Computer Game CDs seem to rarely ever produce anything but Moccis. I popped in 38 Music CDs and got approximately 34 DIFFERENT monsters. I also tried a few DVDs and PS games and got different ones as well. But when I used 48 Computer Game CDs, I got a total of 43 Moccis!!!  <BR> <BR>Now I can understand multiple-disk games such as Riven, The 11th Hour, etc. giving you the same monster for each of THAT GAME&#39;S CDs, but there should be a difference between the monster produced from all five Riven CDs and the one from all four 11th Hour CDs. &#40;Example: 5 Suezos and 4 Jells&#41; <BR> <BR>I thought MR3 was supposed to be all versatile and create a variety of monsters from Music, PS, DVD, and Computer Game CDs? So why the variety in Music, PS, and DVD, but constant repetition in Computer Games? If anyone knows, please clue me in. I&#39;ve tried everything from Duke Nukem to Myst. Thanks!

<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
The reason why the MR3 ads, game box, &amp; manual specifically don&#39;t say to use computer game CDs, or use the term CD-ROM, is because they don&#39;t work well due to protections Sony put in place to prevent pirates from using burned CDs in the system rather than genuine copies of games.  <BR> <BR>In the Japanese version, they froze the game up entirely. Tecmo fixed that bug, but it really was never designed to read computer CD-ROMs.  <BR> <BR>I personally consulted on the wording of the magazine ads, which all read &#34;the ablity to generate original monsters from DVDs, CDs and other video games&#34;. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the game manual, you know the one that came with the game, &#40;page 3&#41; on the subject: <BR><I>&#34;The following discs can be used as Saucer Stones: <BR><UL><LI>Playstation and Playstation 2 compatible CD-ROM <LI>Playstation 2 compatible DVD-ROM <LI>DVD videos sold in stores <LI>Music CDs sold in stores</LI></UL> <BR>Note that inserting a disc that is not compatible with the Playstation 2 format may result in improper operation. For details, see the Playstation 2 user&#39;s manual.</I>

 &#40;&#42;Shrug&#42;&#41; Ok, my fault then. I took CDs to mean Computer CDs as well. I&#39;ve gotten some decent monsters from them on MR1 and 2, so I just thought it odd that they kept giving me Moccis on 3. Thanks for clearing that up. I will add, however, that you can get a Fukazo from &#34;Sam and Max Hit the Road&#34;, a Monzo from &#34;The 7th Guest&#34; disk 1, and a Tortboy from the &#34;Warcraft Expansion CD&#34;. So, it&#39;s rare, but you can get the occasional cool monster from Computer CDs. However, be prepared to get LOTS of Moccis while you search. Catch you all later!

 yep...&#91;pulls out mr1 cd list&#93;...that was true in mr1 - pc cds tended to produce pures within a very small range.  mr2 gave more variety, although there was a high percentage of melon suezos.  mr3 gives you mocchi after mocchi. <BR> <BR>unless i really feel a need to see a lot of mocchis, i am staying away from shrining pc cds.
