Ok, I did some research on breaking the Failure Chain because we got the idea that items may be the source to breaking it. Well, if you want more, read on.  <BR> <BR>This is quite an interesting topic and you will probably have to read all the details in order to make best of it. This will be split into different sections: <BR> <BR>1. Things Used/Procedure <BR>2. Once I found an &#34;All Failure Week&#34; <BR>3. Once I used the Monster Nip <BR>4. Conclusion <BR>5. Comments/Self-Experiences <BR> <BR><B>1. Things Used/Procedure</B> <BR> <BR>I used a Mocchi/M for this research. He was born on Feb 4th, and I found a Failure drill on April 4th. I was doing 3 light drills and a rest, until I found a failure week. He was being fed 4 in Favorite and 4 in Nutrition. I was saving everyday, and if he failed, I would start testing the other drills in that locale and others&#40;More detail in 2.&#41;. I did the Locales in this order: Goat, Kalaragi, Takrama, Brilla, Morx. If he did fail all the drills given I would proceed to using the Monster Nip&#40;More Detail in 3.&#41; My Mocchi Liked Monster Nip, and was &#34;Its happy&#34; after I gave it the item. <BR> <BR><B>2. Once I found an &#34;All Failure Week&#34;</B> <BR> <BR>Ok I was doing this by finding a week where no matter what I do my monster failed. That includes in all the locales and in Light Drills, Hard Drills, Hardest Drills. Once I hit a failure week, I would test it like this: Test Light Drill in that locale Twice, test 2 of the Hard Drills, and test on Hardest Drill. I did this for each locale.&#40;Morx was a bit of an exception, but I still used the same concept as in the other locales&#41; Once I found a week with all failures, I used Monster Nip. <BR> <BR><B>3. Once I used the Monster Nip</B> <BR> <BR>Once I found a week of all fails, I went back to Goat, and used Monster Nip. I used the same procdedure as I did when I found a failure week. Well, the suprise is in the Conclusion. <BR> <BR><B>4. Conclusion</B> <BR> <BR>Well, you know, I was hoping that we had something here, but it turns out, in this case, <B>Monster Nip does not affect the Failure Chain !</B> I was really hoping that it would help out in breaking it, and saving time and increase raising time, and stats. But I also think there are other factors involved here..... <BR> <BR><B>5. Comments/Self-Experiences</B> <BR> <BR>Ok, now I know there are other factors involved. During this experiment and other times of raising, I have noticed that the change in Play over time plays a major role in breaking the failure chain. For Example: Lets say I saved on Week 2 of June. Then The next week I don&#39;t save, my monster completes its drill. Next week, I don&#39;t save again, monster Fails. Now, I reset to Week 2. I raise on week 3, he completes. I raise on Week 4, and suprisingly, he completes. Now I think Items can be a part of this &#34;Time Change&#34; when using the item itself, to change the game&#39;s plans. The game was&#39;nt expecting you to use that item, and changed its way of doing what it was going to do, and in that case, your failure can turn into a Success. I will research alot more on this topic, but before I do, I want to see what you guys have to say about this.

 its disappointing that monster nip didnt do the trick.  it seems as though there are no &#34;sure-fire simple&#34; items in mr3 the way there was in mr2. <BR> <BR>let me add something i just noticed with my very young mew, who still fails a lot.  i think it is true of any monster that the &#34;did not complete his drill&#34; failure response cannot be remedied, while the &#34;did not do very well&#34; response can often be undone if you try an easier drill.  well, i took little moo all over tochika, and he got the &#34;did not do very well&#34; message everywhere.  finally, i took him to the easiest possible drill - trampoline&#91;life&#93; in morx.  he also failed that...but he got the other failure message.  i never noticed this before, but to be honest, the last time i did failure chain research, i didnt have a very good understanding of the two responses, and how they work. <BR> <BR>by itself, this is just trivial, but maybe it could be another piece to the puzzle.

 I think you have something here torey. Thats a very observative thing though. Maybe in a way, giving it an item, perhaps on one of the 2 types of failure weeks, can effect the drill/failure. It is something else to test, but besides this, there is Stress and Fatigue involved. I&#39;ve had &#40;and you guys probably did to&#41; an experience where my monster would fail the Hardest Drill of that Locale, because I&#39;m assuming that this drill had higher Stress/fatigue gain, than a lighter dril would. So I reset because my monster failed, and do a lighter drill, and he passes. But this is&#39;nt really breaking the failure chain, because I would assume that a person would still rather do a hard drill than a light drill.  <BR> <BR>So, I think that we need to find a Stress/Fatigue relieve Item &#40;Other from the Venture ones&#41; that can be bought. I think this would make a whole world of difference to MR3 and the way we raise our mosnters.

 i was thinking, and i have no good arguement for it, but i just wanted to throw the card on the table. Perhaps, for example giving your monster  monster nip on week 1 does not initiate its affect until week 2. So that the monster nip, will not benifit from the item in that regard on the same week the item was fed. <BR> <BR>To counter my own thought, feeding a large egg to a monster, has an imediate affect in that it cures hay fever &#40;or what have you&#41; as soon as the monster eats it. the same goes for diet grass, and its affect on weight.

 Its an idea Shadow, but you first thought would have to mean that you predict the future. Cause if you monster fails on week one, and you give it the item, may cause your monster to pass the next week, but even without the item, it could have still passed. Although you could save on week 4 of last month, then give it the item, and since you are expecting it to fail on week 1 it might work out.  <BR> <BR>And maybe feeding it an Item that takes effect on the same day as you gave it, might even work better. Its something to try out, I know that much....
