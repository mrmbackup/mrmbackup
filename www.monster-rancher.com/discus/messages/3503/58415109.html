This is Psych0midget from the gamefaqs message board. i just wanted to bring to everyone&#39;s attention the concept of raising specified monsters for life and speed. the whole process involves selective drills &#40;maximizing gains and minimizing losses&#41; and proper heart management. My specific area of specialized training was in Tank monsters &#40;max lif, pow, def&#41; but recently, we have been able to add a close to maxed speed stat to the mix. yes, 4 maxed stats in less than 4 generations. sound good? read on. <BR> <BR>heres a quick rundown. start with a suezo to give the Tank line sharp eyes. raise it in Lif and Def, also some power. if you can max lif and def, thats 200 points EACH to be given to life and defense stats. helps alot. not to mention sharp eyes. <BR> <BR>the first generation of the line &#40;durahan / golem / zan are good choices&#41; should &#40;but not needed&#41; have a trait like Armor / tough skin / stone body. this will help when taking hits. Choose selective trainings to raise Lif, Def and Pow, while losing ONLY inteligence &#40;assuming tank monster wont have int moves&#41;. some good selective drills are  <BR> <BR>Starfish &#40;goat&#41;       raise pow, lows int <BR>Rock Push &#40;takrama&#41;        ,        , <BR>Dive &#40;kalaragi&#41;       raise def, lows int <BR>Avalanche &#40;brillia&#41;        ,        ,  <BR> <BR>and also <BR> <BR>Swirl &#40;goat&#41;        raise pow, raise def, low spd &#40;stat loss in manageable&#41; <BR>Blowfish &#40;goat&#41;     raise spd, raise pow, low int &#40;more on this later&#41; <BR>Chase &#40;kalaragi&#41;    raise lif, raise spd, low int <BR>Tornado &#40;takrama&#41;   raise lif, raise def, low speed <BR> <BR>the first gen tank, with help of the suezo, and selective drills should net you stats in the range of <BR> <BR>lif: 600&#43; <BR>pow: 900-max <BR>int: more than likely 1 <BR>spd: 400 or less <BR>def: 800-max <BR> <BR>What we are trying to accomplish here is to specialize the first generation to be an awesome heart in the end. if you can get close to max Lif, Def and Pow, thats a whole 600 points towards the next monster. When you do, the AWESOME monsters start to pour in. read on. <BR> <BR>When you get a decent heart, give it to a monster at its prime. i say this because you need ample time to decide if the monster is worthwhile or not. choose one with a leaning towards speed. Zans are awesome. the whole generation line should have kept a few things stable. Armor, sharp eyes, your best techs passed down, and max pow and def. if you can manage it, you can max the speed stat as well. the key to a FAST TANK monster is the Blowfish drill in goat. Train early, and train persistently. at the point they can get 20&#39;s or so on drills, have them do blowfish. it will raise Spd more than Pow, but thats ok since we can use a heart crystal. at 700 spd and 600 pow, you are set! the heart should up pow to 800, so at prime, leave it alone and raise Lif and Def. Choose drills wisely to avoid loss. by my third gen, and at 4 yrs, i had 900 lif, 999 pow, 999 def, and 950 speed. a stat total of 3,850 points. im not alone on this, a handful of others at the gamefaqs board have achieved this as well. <BR> <BR>You may think that having armor on a speed monster like zan would throw off his evade rate. i notice no such thing. he evades more times then he gets to use tough skin. speed is not even a requirement for this method. pow and defense are enough to get you thru the major 5. speed has the added perks of a slight guts recovery improvement, as well as dodging rates.  <BR> <BR>if you want more detailed info on this raising method, as well as the variations, battle tips, tech management and that sort of stuff for Tank monsters, check the topic at gamefaqs. id love to hear your comments, suggestions and this has worked for you or not.

 psych0midget again. sorry, ill register here soon.  <BR> <BR>Here is my personal success story. Its a third generation Zan. &#40;suezo&#62;zan&#40;goat&#41;&#62;zan&#40;?&#41;. died around 4 yrs 10 months at S class.  <BR> <BR>Lif: 750 <BR>Pow: 999 <BR>Int: 1 <BR>Spd: 950 <BR>Def: 950    &#40;rough estimates, but pretty accurate&#41; <BR> <BR>had the techs sonic knife, reverse raid &#40;max level&#41;, rising rave and double summer &#40;max level&#41;. <BR>traits were resist cold, resist heat, tough skin, sharp eyes, sharp ears, wind wisdom, ltng secrets. <BR> <BR>Was it a breeze to raise. Now ill try to work on a special variation of this method for dragons, since they live shorter lives. I think Grupus&#39; chlorophyll will make it a great starter for the line.

 WOW! if thats true, AWESOME! ill definetly try it out! BTW not to say that i dont belive you it sounds fully plausible, but gamefaqs has been known to post some BS methods, so im always a bit skeptical.

 It&#39;s great that you&#39;ve also posted your info here.  Although it would take many generations, I think that Dragons might be able to get some really useful abilities &#40;Armor, Tough Skin, Hard Scales, Sharp Eyes, Fast Footwork, Intuition, Resists Magic, etc.&#41;  If a Dragon with those abilities had four stats maxed, it would be pretty much unstoppable.

 danz, i know what you mean. already people are sprouting out with monsters into the 4000 stat total range... only a day after i posted this. haha. not trying to be an <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>, but i havent even gotten to a true 4 stats maxed monster. &#40;always 900s, not always 999s&#41;. not only that, they do this before i mention the greatness of Blowfish drills, and when i do say &#39;why didnt i think of that.&#39; to make matters even less believable, they have 999 on 4 stats including speed, ON A DURAHAN &#40;whose speed is VERY hard to raise, specially without Blowfish&#41; thats only 3rd gen. im highly skeptical, but im sure we can all tell fact from fiction. i assure you, my monsters are all raised normally.  <BR> <BR>actually dark dragon, ive been working to get one heart with a series of really awesome traits, to be later given to my favorite monster. so far it includes Light Aura &#40;i think it works wonderfully and accomodates armor/def very well&#41;, sharp eyes, armor, sharp ears, iron heart and a few strong vs traits. however, some wont be passed down at all times, so you have to think carefully. Dragons work well, except for the low lifespan. <BR> <BR>lisa, thanks for the tip, i was looking for a registration area and didnt find it =&#41; <BR> <BR>Ill get started on a speed monster guide. if you guys like the results here, ill try out more specialized training methods. My zan line is getting really close to that coveted 4 stats maxed status.

 i would not go so far as call this a method.  in order for this to be an actual method we would need to know a couple of things, such as:  how many weeks per month to drill?  do you reset on failures?  on mere success?  which drills do you do?  and when? <BR> <BR>right now, this is a recitation of some interesting ideas,  which need further development.
