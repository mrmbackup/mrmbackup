During my raising of monsters, i have noticed that monsters and their tech arrays sometimes have tech stats that seem lower or higher than the average monster. This led to many hours looking at the tech charts. While it is clear that techs like dragon&#39;s salamander are high damage and plant&#39;s stab is low damage, what about the middle? Is 20-40 decent? what if a monster&#39;s highest damage tech is only decent for a different monster? Questions like these prompted me to make a chart. My process for the chart is simple. I have seperated it into 30 rows for every monster and in each column is the mean of all of a monster&#39;s tech&#39;s &#40;1&#41;damage, &#40;2&#41;gutsdown, &#40;3&#41;critical, &#40;4&#41;Hit, and &#40;5&#41; Guts Cost. The chart also seperates int techs from power techs due to major differences, and does not include non-attack &#40;heal, def up&#41; techs. The median is the median of both int and pow techs together. All techs are at MAXIMUM level.Without further ado, the charts. <BR> <BR>Power Techs <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD><B>Monster</B></TD><TD><B>Damage</B></TD><TD><B>Gutsdown</B></TD><TD><B>Crit</B></TD><TD><B>Hit</B></TD><TD><B>Gutscost</B></TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Median</B></TD><TD>28.2</TD><TD>15.5</TD><TD>10.3</TD><TD>48</TD><TD>29.9</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Baku</TD><TD>37.8</TD><TD>16.2</TD><TD>12</TD><TD>47.8</TD><TD>30.4</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Beaklon</TD><TD>32.2</TD><TD>8.4</TD><TD>15.4</TD><TD>46.8</TD><TD>36.3</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Color Pandora</TD><TD>32.7</TD><TD>14.1</TD><TD>10.2</TD><TD>50</TD><TD>24.6</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dakkung</TD><TD>24.3</TD><TD>11.8</TD><TD>5</TD><TD>45.3</TD><TD>26.5</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dragon</TD><TD>40.1</TD><TD>18</TD><TD>16.1</TD><TD>55.6</TD><TD>29.3</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Durahan</TD><TD>32.5</TD><TD>5</TD><TD>11</TD><TD>46.6</TD><TD>29.4</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Gitan</TD><TD>31.8</TD><TD>14.8</TD><TD>12</TD><TD>49.7</TD><TD>29.5</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Golem</TD><TD>41.6</TD><TD>8.9</TD><TD>12.7</TD><TD>45.9</TD><TD>27.6</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Hare</TD><TD>35.3</TD><TD>13.8</TD><TD>11</TD><TD>46</TD><TD> 30.7</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Hengar</TD><TD>26.6</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>7.2</TD><TD>47.2</TD><TD>18.6</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Jell</TD><TD>30</TD><TD>14.6</TD><TD>10.9</TD><TD>48</TD><TD>24.4</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Joker</TD><TD> 30.8</TD><TD>7</TD><TD>13.3</TD><TD>44.5</TD><TD>26</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Lesione</TD><TD> 27.7</TD><TD>12.5</TD><TD>2.3</TD><TD>48.5</TD><TD>26.7</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Mew</TD><TD> 28.2</TD><TD>6.8</TD><TD>17</TD><TD>48</TD><TD>26.4</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Mocchi</TD><TD>28.6</TD><TD>13.4</TD><TD>13.3</TD><TD>45.4</TD><TD>28.9</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Mogi</TD><TD>35.9</TD><TD>16.6</TD><TD>7.9</TD><TD>49.6</TD><TD>31.1</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Momo</TD><TD> 31.7</TD><TD>10.3</TD><TD>20</TD><TD>45</TD><TD>31.2</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Naga</TD><TD>30</TD><TD>7.6</TD><TD>18.1</TD><TD>43.1</TD><TD>28.3</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Octopee</TD><TD>30.5</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>6.5</TD><TD>44</TD><TD>32.5</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Ogyu</TD><TD>24.6</TD><TD>11.8</TD><TD>14</TD><TD>47.4</TD><TD>26.4</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Pancho</TD><TD>23</TD><TD>7.3</TD><TD>14.3</TD><TD>49</TD><TD>28.3</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Pixie</TD><TD>22.7</TD><TD>10.3</TD><TD>6.7</TD><TD>45</TD><TD>27.7</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Plant</TD><TD>29.8</TD><TD>6.6</TD><TD>3.2</TD><TD>48.2</TD><TD>28.4</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>PSI-Roller</TD><TD>32.9</TD><TD>11.7</TD><TD>11</TD><TD>44.3</TD><TD>35.8</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Raiden</TD><TD>26.1</TD><TD>11.4</TD><TD>14.5</TD><TD>45.4</TD><TD>26.8</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Suezo</TD><TD>32.5</TD><TD>20.5</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>40.8</TD><TD>27.3</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Suzurin</TD><TD>24.8</TD><TD>13.3</TD><TD>7.3</TD><TD>47.5</TD><TD>23.5</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Tiger</TD><TD>36.7</TD><TD>10.1</TD><TD>17.6</TD><TD>46.9</TD><TD>30.4</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Zan</TD><TD>32.7</TD><TD>7.9</TD><TD>10.4</TD><TD>50</TD><TD>28</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Zoom</TD><TD>28.1</TD><TD>9.6</TD><TD>12.7</TD><TD>27</TD><TD>31.1</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Median</B></TD><TD>28.2</TD><TD>15.5</TD><TD>10.3</TD><TD>48</TD><TD>29.9</TD></TR></TABLE>

Before i go on to int techs, i have a few more things to say. The chart isn&#39;t about ranking the techs/monster so much about revealing the monster&#39;s tech array. A monster with something around the median will have a diverse selection of techs to choose from. Please don&#39;t be mislead by the numbers. In addition to that, some monsters only have one or two int or power techs, which can be deceiving for the averages. Now for the int chart. <BR> <BR>Intelligence Techs <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD><B>Monster</B></TD><TD><B>Damage</B></TD><TD><B>Gutsdown</B></TD><TD><B>Crit</B></TD><TD><B>Hit</B></TD><TD><B>Gutscost</B></TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Median</B></TD><TD>28.2</TD><TD>15.5</TD><TD>10.3</TD><TD>48</TD><TD>29.9</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Baku</TD><TD>31</TD><TD>32.8</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>45.2</TD><TD>28.6</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Beaklon</TD><TD>9</TD><TD>40</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>50</TD><TD>30</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Color Pandora</TD><TD>49</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>49</TD><TD>50</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dakkung</TD><TD>33.7</TD><TD>18.2</TD><TD>16.3</TD><TD>40.7</TD><TD>32.2</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dragon</TD><TD>32</TD><TD>25</TD><TD>9.7</TD><TD>54</TD><TD>29.7</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Durahan</TD><TD>33</TD><TD>11</TD><TD>11.5</TD><TD>48.5</TD><TD>31.5</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Gitan</TD><TD>26.5</TD><TD>25.7</TD><TD>14.2</TD><TD>45.8</TD><TD>29</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Golem</TD><TD>18</TD><TD>11</TD><TD>5</TD><TD>64</TD><TD>24</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Hare</TD><TD>10.3</TD><TD>44.7</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>50.7</TD><TD>23.3</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Hengar</TD><TD>27</TD><TD>29.4</TD><TD>13</TD><TD>54</TD><TD>29</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Jell</TD><TD>34.8</TD><TD>28.3</TD><TD>5.8</TD><TD>48.8</TD><TD>34</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Joker</TD><TD>26.5</TD><TD>20.5</TD><TD>8.2</TD><TD>49.3</TD><TD>32.5</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Lesione</TD><TD>33.3</TD><TD>20.5</TD><TD>14.8</TD><TD>49.3</TD><TD>35.5</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Mew</TD><TD>28.8</TD><TD>24.3</TD><TD>13.8</TD><TD>53.3</TD><TD>35</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Mocchi</TD><TD>23</TD><TD>24</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>52.3</TD><TD>33</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Mogi</TD><TD>24</TD><TD>33.4</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>51</TD><TD>31</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Momo</TD><TD>23.7</TD><TD>20</TD><TD>9</TD><TD>48.3</TD><TD>28.7</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Naga</TD><TD>26.7</TD><TD>16.3</TD><TD>4.7</TD><TD>43</TD><TD>37</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Octopee</TD><TD>16.4</TD><TD>26.4</TD><TD>11.1</TD><TD>48.3</TD><TD>35.4</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Ogyu</TD><TD>20.6</TD><TD>34</TD><TD>5.7</TD><TD>47</TD><TD>35.3</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Pancho</TD><TD>21.2</TD><TD>17.2</TD><TD>12.7</TD><TD>49</TD><TD>31.8</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Pixie</TD><TD>17.9</TD><TD>22.4</TD><TD>6.4</TD><TD>47.4</TD><TD>30.1</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Plant</TD><TD>15.2</TD><TD>20.5</TD><TD>9.2</TD><TD>50.5</TD><TD>32.8</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>PSI-Roller</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>33</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>47</TD><TD>20</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Raiden</TD><TD>21</TD><TD>40.5</TD><TD>4.5</TD><TD>48</TD><TD>31</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Suezo</TD><TD>26.7</TD><TD>29.6</TD><TD>9.7</TD><TD>48</TD><TD>33</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Suzurin</TD><TD>34.4</TD><TD>18.7</TD><TD>5.9</TD><TD>47.4</TD><TD>33.3</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Tiger</TD><TD>23.5</TD><TD>40</TD><TD>12.5</TD><TD>52</TD><TD>38.5</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Zan</TD><TD>22</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>5</TD><TD>51</TD><TD>22</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Zoom</TD><TD>20.7</TD><TD>28.3</TD><TD>11.5</TD><TD>48</TD><TD>32.3</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Median</B></TD><TD>28.2</TD><TD>15.5</TD><TD>10.3</TD><TD>48</TD><TD>29.9</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Whew!

 Some observations i made along the way. <BR>Power techs have higher damage and critical rates on average than int techs. <BR>Int techs have higher guts down and slightly higher hit rates on average than power techs. <BR>Guts costs seem to be the same for the averages. <BR>As torey noted, there seems to be a connection between better techs and lower guts regain rates. I have yet to prove this mathematically. Nor have i noted the &#34;____ secrets&#34; characteristics effects on damage, which could close a somewhat large gap between the median int damage and the median pow damage.  <BR>I also proved my suspicion that my yuppee&#39;s techs don&#39;t do that much damage &#40;on average&#41; compared to the crowd. <BR>I&#39;m happy to try and answer any questions that might arise over this. <BR>I hope this can be found useful to ranchers somehow.

 Deadbuffalo, Good Job. Concerning the &#34;____ secrets&#34;, it would be helpful to find out the role of life wisdom/secrets. There are no life type moves, but i perhaps &#39;Life&#39; refers to attack types such as stab, beat, pound, etc... I intend to test this when/if i acquire Life Secrets. I perfer to test with Life Secrets because there will be a more noticable difference than Life Wisdom. Feel free to beat me to it if you get Life Secrets before i do!

 Logic? I think I know. The Drain attacks drain life. Now I&#39;m not sure if they give YOU back any life but still. Or it could be an attack like heal ring &#40;I don&#39;t know how to call it; it&#39;s for pixie&#41; which heals you. Just my two cents.

 Everyone makes mistakes like that - myself included. It&#39;s really challenging to tell the gender of people online without asking ASL, and that is considered rude in many places so it isn&#39;t all that common.

 Yeah, I know. I&#39;m not mad or anything, just telling you. Unless it&#39;s one of your friends or someone you&#39;ve seen before &#40;or you have magical powers&#41; there is really no way to tell, exept asking the ASL. You are right Khift, that is impolite, though.

 Strange how people are intsantly more polite to someone when they find out the person is a female! Interresting... but i must admit, i am no exception.  <BR> <BR>To get back on topic... I personally don&#39;t believe Life Wisdom/Secrets affects techs that drain. I already mentioned that it might have to do with techs of the type beat, pound, cut, etc... No one seemed to have any opinions on that.  <BR>What we really need is for someone to acquire Life Secrets and test it. I personally don&#39;t have it at the time to test it. Maybe we will eventually get the numbers from Campster when he/she is finished hacking the game, and have a definitive answer.

 Actually, richard has been tackling that half of it.  We actually think we&#39;ve got all the identifiers for the characteristics now. <BR> <BR>But trial and error will be the way at present with characteristics.  All the save does is tell you what characteristic it has.  There&#39;s no hard value like &#43;10% to pow or anything.   <BR> <BR>So the only way to test &#40;which I&#39;ve started but been distracted by real life projects&#41; is to battle identical guys over and over and give the individual characteristic to only one....talk about mind numbing. But it is possible to at least get a better guess.  <BR> <BR>But I&#39;ve been looking for how much.  Sounds like you&#39;re looking for &#34;affects what&#34;.  Most characteristics are obvious to this fact....you&#39;re right....life wisdom/secrets isn&#39;t.  But all the other secrets correlate to a move affiliation &#40;i.e. wind secrets affect wind moves&#41;.  I went thru all the techs and none say &#34;life&#34; for affiliation but some are blank.  Specifically momo&#39;s full which is a life recovery move has no affiliation.  I&#39;ll theorize this increases recovery moves or that life moves are the ones that are blank...It&#39;s a starting point. <BR> <BR>Remember we&#39;re only hacking the save.  The game itself is an already compiled program that&#39;s over 550 megs in size....I am not skilled enough or crazy enough to try and decompile and decode that.  So I ain&#39;t hacking that.  I am bugged there isn&#39;t a GS2 &#34;pro&#34; &#40;like psx game shark and gameshark pro&#41; though to help the hacking process.  <BR> <BR>Finally, I am a &#34;HE&#34; and I would&#39;ve been polite to Lightning Tiger regardless of her gender.

 Actually, that is a good thought, Life referring to life recovery techs!

 So do dragons. CPs, Golems, Mogis, Hares, and Jells also have high damage in either int and pow &#40;which is what i think you meant to say&#41;. If you continue to look at the techs of some of these monstres, you&#39;ll notice that they&#39;re a lot better than some of the other breeds techs. The connection between the monsters listed above is that they all have slow guts regain. So while their techs may hit harder, they won&#39;t hit as often. Of course, this is all from a theoretical stance, but the point is that all the monsters have a balance between techs and guts regain. <BR> <BR>And yes, yay Bakus.
