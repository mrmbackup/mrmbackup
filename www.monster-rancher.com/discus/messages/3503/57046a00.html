Has anyone noticed that some monsters are more likely to perform <FONT COLOR="0077aa">greats</FONT> than others? <BR>In the same way, some monsters are more likley to <FONT COLOR="ff0000">fail</FONT>? <BR>My <FONT COLOR="ff6000">Octopee</FONT> only failed 3 times in his 4y6m life, but my <FONT COLOR="0000ff">Jell</FONT> failed over 40! Anyone know why this is?  <BR>The <FONT COLOR="0000ff">Jell</FONT> had only Jell Body as a characteristic, and my <FONT COLOR="ff6000">octopee</FONT> had no characteristics.

 40!?!? Are you kidding? Oh, Umm, no I don&#39;t know why. It could be what stats you trained or where you trained. It also could be what food you gave them. I&#39;m out of here.

 there are wide disparities between success and failure, but there are so many possible variables &#91;breed, age, health, drill, location, and what you said to him or fed him recently just to name a few&#93;that could contribute to this.

ok. <BR>anyways, i raised both from a saucer stone and ALWAYS gave them items that had 4 nutrition. The reason for my <FONT COLOR="0000ff">Jell&#39;s</FONT> failures was that until its 1st birthday, it had that BLASTED trait whimsical. I failed 2 out of 3 times and he still failed after losing the characteristic.

 I have something odd happen to me but I&#39;m not sure if it is a coincidence or something important. When my monsters get a great, and I reply with an &#34;As expected&#34;, if it is &#34;Very Satisfied&#34; it seems to do another great the next week. By doing this with my Zan, I got about 10 greats in a row.

 I&#39;ve fed a creature with a 4-nutrient food before and still had it fail on the immediately following drill.

 I always alternate between &#34;Great Job&#34; and &#34;Keep Going!&#34; Fleria says that my monster understands when I say &#34;Keep Going!&#34;. To me, it sounds like when you say &#34;As Expected!&#34; it puts pressure on your monster to do better and stresses him out.  But that&#39;s just my opinion. <BR> <BR>Nick Papageorge  <BR>&#40;Bariroller Trainer&#41;

 Well, I believe that As Expected tells the monster that it did how you had hoped it would...  which does emphasize doing it again... <BR> <BR>It really helps, tho <BR> <BR>I think it reduces stress, as Dim-Witted seems to normalize stress stuff, and Dim-Witted is bad with As Expected, nearly always...

 My observations: <BR>-On Fails: there are many factors that triggers failures. One, what the monster was fed. Two, If it is tired or stressed. Three, what you say when you talk to it.  <BR> <BR>For example: I had saved my game only 2 months b4 the fail. When my monster failed, I loaded to see how to change the problem. I fed it something else, said other things when it had a great &#40;to toughen its will&#41;. Then on that &#34;failure&#34; week, it had a successful instead. <BR> <BR>As for monsters that were being lazy &#40;no tired look&#41; you need to say something or feed something to ur monster that doesn&#39;t spoil it. As for tired monsters, either rest it anyway, or try to do different things a month &#40;or 2 or 3&#41; b4 the fail. <BR> <BR>What to feed and what to say are things I&#39;m dont know of. This needs more research and proof. <BR> <BR>On greats: this is similar to fails, but in an opposite way. The monster will do greats when: it is healthy, not stressed, has will-power&#40;depends on what u say to it I guess&#41;, and is rested. According to what I observed, all that goes along with this: the monster get what it &#34;likes.&#34; My Zan that liked to battle, was allowed to fight alot on its 1st and 2nd years. Then after it stopped battling constantly, it started to get Great-chains through out its life. The chain goes something similar to this: great-great-success-rest. Of course it didnt always get greats, it gets a failure or a normal success. I was like &#34;GO ZAN&#34; the whole time I trained it. <BR> <BR>What I have posted isn&#39;t entirely true, but it&#39;s pretty accurate to me. &#42;In other words, this needs others to prove for me

 i have gained some experience at failures, and what happens after you reset and try to avoid them.  none of the following is proven, just what i have observed: <BR> <BR>1&#93;  failures occur most often in babyhood and old age.  they trail off in intermediate steps until, at the prime of prime, my monsters almost never fail.  i always feed nutritious&#91;defined as 3 or 4 blocks&#93; food and never let get more than &#34;is tired&#34;. <BR> <BR>2&#93;  when failures occur, i sometimes can reset and avoid them by &#91;a&#93; going to an easier drill, or &#91;b&#93; trying a drill in a different region.  if the monster is on &#34;seems healthy&#34;, i sometimes rest rather than take a failure; if there is a desirable battle, sometimes i go there instead of taking a failure. <BR> <BR>3&#93;  as has been previously noted, some weeks are just destined to be &#34;failure weeks&#34;...no matter what you do, the monster is going to fail. <BR> <BR>as to greats, this is even more tentative, because i haevnt reset to try to get greats: <BR> <BR>1&#93;  i seem to have a greater percentage of greats at or near prime than i do as i approach babyhood or old age, with one exception.  it seems that 2 months before death, i get a large number of failures, and then the next month, right before death, i get a burst of successes, often including a few greats. <BR> <BR>2&#93;  when i get significant stress reduction &#91;such as at venture when i find a lot of big shells, etc&#93; i often have a string of greats.  this effect is so strong, that i have accurately predicted a number of greats just because i correctly gauged my monster to be relatively free of stress.  even at its best, tho, there is still some element of randomness.

 Firstly, I agree with Torey on the &#34;some weeks are destined to fail.&#34;  In fact, I&#39;ve backed up as many as three months training time &#40;I really should start saving on more than one block&#41;, only to end up with a &#34;Failure&#34; that exact same week as before I had loaded. <BR> <BR>About the regional differnces?  I agree 100% whole-heartedly.  If a monster CAN over-ride the failure, taking it to a similar region and doing a likewise drill will USUALLY result in a decent &#34;Success.&#34;  This MAY have to do with Nate&#39;s hypothesis pertaining to the factors that make up a region &#40;temperature, moisture&#41;.  In addition, taking monsters that fail to different regions to do DIFFERENT drills seems to help somewhat, though I surmize that it increases stress &#40;like moving from the ranch does in MR1&#41;. <BR> <BR>Food?  I&#39;ve noticed a significant increase in stats from high nutrition meals compared to just spoiling it with junk.  Whether this contributes to the &#34;Great&#34; effect or not is debateable, however. <BR> <BR>What one says to a monster?  Possibly, this is an indication of stress acumlation or even just age.  &#34;As Expected&#34; works wonders for multiple &#34;Great&#34;s, however, it seems to lose its&#39; effect during the last phases of life, where &#34;Keep Going&#34; is about the only thing one can say without offending or boring their monster.  As for getting less failures from what you say, I vote &#34;YES&#34;.  Occasionally, I have a monster that likes to slack off early or late in life more than most &#40;&#42;cough&#42; Zuum &amp; Raiden &#42;cough&#42;&#41;.  When i get so fed-up with poor stat-gain and multiple weeks/months of failures, I crack down with a &#34;Try Harder&#34;.  Withing two of those, the monster goes back to succeeding at a rapid rate, but also stresses slightly easier from that point.  I&#39;m assuming this is the  &#34;will&#34; factor that the rival trainers lecture so dilegently. <BR> <BR>Of course, when it all comes down to it, no conglomeration of experiences is going to get a set-in-stone answer until we can &#34;shark&#34; the game and extract the facts.  Remember, it was about this point in MR2&#39;s career when we all believed that generations increased lifespan, and a few months before that, we were contemplating the effective lifespan loss of &#34;Nuts Oil&#34; and &#34;Mint Leaf&#34;.  In essence, we&#39;ve only scratched the surface, and until we get hard-core evidence, this is all just opinion and speculation.

 What I think about those &#34;destined failure weeks&#34; <BR>These weeks never change, because you never did more things to change the fails.  <BR> <BR>Why monsters failed &#40;teenage/prime yrs&#41;: you said something to your monster earlier in its life, and it probably triggers this. I mean like maybe you spoiled your monster or did or say something to disappoint it. Since you cant track everything you do, you cant figure what to do to change these failures. <BR> <BR>If you didnt undo fails, then that means you didnt do the right thing earlier. It doesnt matter if you go back 3 months or whatever, it matters exactly what you feed and say to your monster accumulatively. This means you need to change everything you did to change failures. <BR> <BR>hey..... what if we could get a method to say and feed monsters and prevent failures....... yes yes yes......

 maybe so, but the number of variables involved - especially if you have to go back more than 3 months - are so staggering that you could never prove this one way or the other...

 Hiya! This is my first post here and who knows!? Perhaps i may be able to add something. <BR> <BR>It seems to be that traits also affect the raising of monsters&#40;and in effect, great and failures.&#41; Such traits that seem to work well&#40; I haven&#39;t extensively reaearched yet,as I am still new to the game and I haven&#39;t beat the top 5 yet.&#41;are ~whimsical~&#40;fauilure,seems to need to rest more.&#41; ~active~&#40;SEEMS, note I can be proven wrong, to increase the points given to power and also lowers the amount of time before said monster requests sleep.&#41; ~perfectionist~&#40;I had one pixie with, one without, and the one with seemed to have quite a few more greats, as the one without didn&#39;t have nearly as many&#40;Around 50 compared to 20!&#41; <BR>         At any rate, some of the items that &#34;balence out nutrition&#34; seem to allow easier greats. <BR> <BR> <BR>      Well, that&#39;s  just my two cents!
