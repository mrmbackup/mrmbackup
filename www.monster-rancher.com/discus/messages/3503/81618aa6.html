 i just started my henger.  i am going to use dmm/campster on it, and, becuase it is being pointed toward the mayors cup in july, it cannot have a heart.   <BR> <BR>on my first venture, at 1 wk, i really wanted to hit all 3 moisy halls, then gain some points, and avoid battles.  i quickly changed my goal to just avoiding battles...and even that took me nearly an hour. <BR> <BR>my question:  has anyone else noticed that, when taking a weak newborn on venture, the game seems to throw battles into your path almost immediately, i.e., the first or second place you visit?  this happened to me more than 10 times in a row.  i havent kept scrupulous track of it, but when i am trying to increase my battle sense when i am older and more ready to win, the battles are not so easy to encounter...

 I seem to recall this while playing the Japanese version early on, of course those days were almost a year ago.  <BR> <BR>I recall having a couple of monsters &#40;my Beaklon in particular&#41; that just seemed to get beaten up no matter what I did, so I stopped trying to do anything besides noisy halls on ventures until they got to be of average/high strength for their rank.

 Torey, I know exactly what you mean, i went through it with Halo, and am going through it with Spinach. The thing is, as my monsters get older and stronger, the still get into unwanted fights all the time, but now, the crush the wild beast like a grape, &#40;well, not yet for Spinach&#41;. When raising Halo, the unwanted fights happened through out her life, but as she got older, i didnt have to wait through the annoying injured monster sequences. Such is the curse of DMMing, at least for me.  <BR> <BR>I wish the game gave you the option of turning down wild battles...but hey, what can a guy do other than reload for an hour and a half... <BR> <BR>Good Luck Torey...

 Yep, definitely have seen this effect before, especially with Ogyos. I couldn&#39;t take &#39;em anywhere that they didn&#39;t get jumped.

 I imagine this &#34;battling right-away&#34; game behaviour is built to engage the new MR3 player who may be reluctant to fight in say the Tochikan Festa or any other battle. This way they are forced to battle quickly and are exposed to what may be the main focus of the game.

 I believe davey can be right.  As all of you know there are many more weaker monsters in the game than the masters raise.  So with his theory aimed at forcing new and younger players to battle to bring them into the game faster, which MR3 was made to do, as you know it was aimed at a younger audience.  The game does this to challenge you in the beginning as the computer monsters are the same level.  I&#39;ve noticed wild monsters only have stats comparable to say a B or C class monster &#40;raised normally or the computer ones&#41;.  Once you get to S Class there are less monsters to battle and less things to accomplish within the game.  If you take a monster that has a composite of 3000 or above, there are very few monsters that will battle you and not forfeit.  When I venture with a maxxed monster &#40;above 3000&#41; wild monsters rarely if at all challenge me.  I believe this can answer the question.

 it doesn&#39;t get that clearcut, ss, but as one who has taken a nearly maxxed monster to venture, it gets close.  late in life, one of my goals has been to keep my battle sense at A so that the noisy halls still give you 15-16 pts a crack, even after hibernation.  i will tell you that there have been times i have had to reset to find battles. <BR> <BR>we need to refine it further, but there does seem to be some evidence that there is something about the game that frontloads venture battles to points early in life, rather than later.

 When i was raising Halo, despite being 4 maxed stats, she still got into fights frequently. Because she was rank E her whole life because i never fought her, it makes me think that the reason for less frequent battles may be rank and not stat totals. However i am not sure exactly how often she got into fight as a child verse as an adult. Just my 2 cents

 ya, tb, this is all anecdotal so far.  no one has done a controlled study...as i sit here, i am not at all sure how you could structure such a study.

 My Aquaria is at rank E still but I have encountered no such anomaly. I think it has alot to do with luck. I mean so far I have only encountered one stray mon during the whole time raising her.

 We try and avoid talking about &#34;luck&#34; here.  <BR> <BR>The game is programmed to have some events happen randomly, others with specific percentages of frequency, and others according to specific circumstances. Threads like this are expected to trigger research into the details of specific circumstances or perhaps percentages for outcomes, in order to better understand the game. With the ultimate hope of giving us eventually as deep an understanding of this game as we have of MR2. <BR> <BR>We would rather not give up the quest for deeper understanding. If we had attributed everything to &#34;luck&#34; in MR2, we would never have had anyone discover any of the key findings in MR2.

 I haven&#39;t had ONE battle during a venture,and I&#39;m almost in my second year. I would like to have a battle, because I heard that the monsters drop stuff, but no monsters want to attack me and my monster.

 Just another useless anecdote, but my brand new E-rank Kaliragi/Jell Gutze ran into the Datonare, Bokker, 4 ventures in a row &#40;Losing each time :/&#41;in Morx using the extract. I got fed up, grabbed a fruit instead, and crossed my fingers. No Bokker. <BR> <BR>Little Gutze was a no heart monster.
