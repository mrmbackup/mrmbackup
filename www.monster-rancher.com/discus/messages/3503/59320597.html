<B>Creating a Powerful Team</B>: <BR> <BR>	In Monster Rancher 3, The VS mode allows for battles with teams of five monsters.  Since MR3 is still relatively new, very few battles &#40;if any&#41; are taking place.  This should serve as a guide to making a balanced and powerful team. <BR> <BR>	The first step in creating a good team is to plan it out.  Balance between monsters is critical.  Try for some variation in types and subtypes, or your team might have serious weaknesses.  One way to create an effective team is to have two offensive monsters, one with very high Pow and another with awesome Int.  You&#39;ll also want a monster with tremendous Lif and Def, as well as a balanced monster with an assortment of moves to round out the team.  Finally, you&#39;ll want to have a fifth monster that you should use as a last resort; it should have above-average statistics in all areas, with a composite of at least 3500. <BR> <BR>	Now that you know what kinds of monsters you want on your team, the next step is to decide exactly which monsters you want to have and what stats you want to focus on.  Here are some suggestions for the types of monsters listed above: <BR> <BR>The statistics below are quite low, and should be used as the <I>minimum</I> statistics for your monsters. <BR> <BR>1. An Offensive Power-based Monster: <BR> <BR>Zans are perfect for this category, but Durahans and Dragons will also work. <BR> <BR>Statistics: <BR> <BR>Lif: 400&#43; <BR>Pow: 800&#43; <BR>Int: N/A <BR>Spd: 800&#43; <BR>Def: 400&#43; <BR> <BR>Recommended Abilities: <BR> <BR>Sharp Eyes - An ability that you&#39;ll want on almost all of your monsters.  Your attacks will hit often. <BR>Armor / Tough Skin / Hard Scales &#40;As many as possible&#41; - This will greatly improve defensive capabilities at the expense of a little evasion. <BR>Light Aura and/or Resists Magic - This will counteract the low Int statistic on the monster <BR> <BR>Purpose:  An offensive powerhouse makes an excellent starting monster.  It can quickly KO enemies before getting seriously damaged. <BR> <BR> <BR>2. An Offensive Intelligence-based Monster: <BR> <BR>Hengars and Pixies are best suited for this category. <BR> <BR>Statistics: <BR> <BR>Lif: 300&#43; <BR>Pow: N/A <BR>Int: 850&#43; <BR>Spd: 900&#43; <BR>Def: 300&#43; <BR> <BR>Recommended Abilities: <BR> <BR>Sharp Eyes / Radar - Sharp Eyes for most monsters, Radar for Hengars. <BR>Armor / Tough Skin / Hard Scales  - While it increases Def, don&#39;t overdo these abilities unless your Lif is decent. <BR>Fast Footwork - This ability can save you in the heat of battle.  It counteracts low defensive statistics. <BR> <BR>Purpose:  With high Int and Spd, this monster can eat away at an enemy&#39;s guts and then blast the foe with powerful Int techs. <BR> <BR> <BR>3. A Balanced Monster: <BR> <BR>Jokers and Dragons are recommended, but nearly any monster will work <BR> <BR>Statistics: <BR> <BR>Lif: 550&#43; <BR>Pow: 500&#43; <BR>Int: 500&#43; <BR>Spd: 650&#43; <BR>Def: 450&#43; <BR> <BR>Recommended Abilities: <BR> <BR>Sharp Eyes - No explanation necessary <BR>Armor / Tough Skin / Hard Scales - Same as above <BR> <BR>Purpose:  It&#39;s strength is its lack of weaknesses.  Use it to balance a team. <BR> <BR> <BR>4. A Tank Monster: <BR> <BR>Panchos, Durahans, Plants, and Golems work well <BR> <BR>Statistics: <BR> <BR>Lif: 800&#43; <BR>Pow: 200/400&#43; <BR>Int: 200/400&#43; <BR>Spd: 500&#43; <BR>Def: 800&#43; <BR> <BR>Recommended Abilities: <BR> <BR>Sharp Eyes - Not as important, but still very useful <BR>Armor / Tough Skin / Hard Scales - As many as possible!  These are important! <BR> <BR>Purpose: This guy should be able to take a serious beating.  Choose between Pow and Int for the attacks and train accordingly. <BR> <BR>5. The Last Resort: <BR> <BR>Dragons are perfect for this, but Durahans will also work <BR> <BR>Statistics: <BR> <BR>Lif: 700&#43; <BR>Pow: 750&#43; <BR>Int: 750&#43; <BR>Spd: 700&#43; <BR>Def: 750&#43; <BR> <BR>Recommended Abilities: <BR> <BR>Sharp Eyes - You know why <BR>Armor / Tough Skin / Hard Scales - As many as possible <BR>Fast Footwork / Intuition - Both if possible <BR>Resists Magic, Ltng, etc. - As many as possible <BR> <BR>Purpose: This is your strongest monster.  With above average stats, no weaknesses, and tons of abilities, he should be able to dish out some decent damage but be able to take a beating. <BR> <BR> <BR>If you can put other useful abilities on your monsters, be sure to do so.   <BR> <BR>Well, that&#39;s just one way to create a team.  It&#39;s good to experiment with different monsters to produce your own style of monster battling.  Use this as a guideline when creating your team. <BR> <BR>Now, here&#39;s a sample team made with these tactics &#40;I haven&#39;t actually made this team, so some of the abilities might not transfer to the monsters&#41;: <BR> <BR>1. Retsu &#40;Zan / Goat&#41; <BR> <BR>Lif: 550 <BR>Pow: 999 <BR>Int: 50 <BR>Spd: 999 <BR>Def: 500 <BR> <BR>Abilities: Sharp Eyes, Armor, Tough Skin, Fast Footwork, Resists Magic/Light Aura <BR> <BR>2. Angel &#40;Pixie / Brillia&#41; <BR> <BR>Lif: 400 <BR>Pow: 50 <BR>Int: 999 <BR>Spd: 999 <BR>Def: 300 <BR> <BR>Abilities: Sharp Eyes, Armor, Light Aura, Fast Footwork <BR> <BR>3. Joker &#40;Joker / Morx&#41; <BR> <BR>Lif: 600 <BR>Pow: 550 <BR>Int: 550 <BR>Spd: 650 <BR>Def: 550 <BR> <BR>Abilities: Illusion Cape, Sharp Eyes, Armor <BR> <BR>4. Galooda &#40;Durahan / Takrama&#41; <BR> <BR>Lif: 700 <BR>Pow: 450 <BR>Int: 200 <BR>Spd: 600 <BR>Def: 750 <BR> <BR>Abilities: Armor, Tough Skin, Sharp Eyes <BR> <BR>5. Fafneel &#40;Dragon / Kalaragi&#41; <BR> <BR>Lif: 700 <BR>Pow: 750 <BR>Int: 725 <BR>Spd: 625 <BR>Def: 700 <BR> <BR>Abilities: Armor, Tough Skin, Fast Footwork, Intuitive, Resists Magic, Iron Heart <BR> <BR> <BR>Well, I hope that this has helped you.  Happy Ranching! <BR> <BR>- <B>DarkDragon</B>

 so far, my experience has been pretty consistent with hearts. besides the approximately 20% statgain, it will take the forte tech of your dead monster &#91;forte probably being the highest level&#93; and either give you that tech, if you dont have it, or move it up several levels if you do.

 Hey torey, i just found an exception to this: I gave my Pancho the heart of my suezo &#40;I rasied the suezo simply to get his heart; at the end of its life, speed and int. were at 999, and life was about 600... not bad for a heartless monster...&#41; The suezo specialized in suezo beam &#40;It fought once in a venture, and KO&#39;d the opponent with the beam&#41; but when i gave the heart to my pancho, nothing happened attack-wise. It got the stat boost, but no new techs or leveled up techs. At least his sharp eyes and sharp ears caried over...

 Dark Dragon, one question: What is the point of having the monster with average stats on the team? &#40;Joker in your example&#41; Why not just have two of those &#34;last resort&#34; monsters? I mean, the last monster is better in every way that i can see, so that average monster just seems like a waste

 Are you sure Suezo beam was in the heart or a different move transferred? Since it&#39;s a bit, you should&#39;ve learned a new move, or gained some levels for &#40;or maxxed out&#41; the Pancho&#39;s Flare bit move.  Only passing orbs should have problems since not all breeds can use every orb.  But if it was Suezo Beam in the heart, than that is weird and I don&#39;t know what to say ;p

 yeah, i know it was suezo beam, because that and some other attack were the only two moves it had &#40;Its other attack was power based, and since my suezo had a power of 1, i never used it&#41; Also, this was the first time i realized it was possible to check heart data by pressing &#34;O&#34; so i know beam was in the heart... My theory &#40;I&#39;ll have to check this&#41; is that since the beam was only at level one, it didn&#39;t add to the skill level of any attack
