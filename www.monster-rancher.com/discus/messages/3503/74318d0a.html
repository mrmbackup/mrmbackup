if i did it right, fenrick now has in slot 1 a colorpandora named &#34;cc&#34; &#91;in honor of the first cloned kitten&#93;.  he turned out pretty good, so i thought i would tell you how i did it. <BR> <BR>first, the reason i chose colorpandora/kalaragi &#91;i think of it as the &#34;pure&#34; because it is the one named colorpandora&#93; is because it likes vine grass 2 blocks at all times.  this means, no matter what else happens, i always have at least a 2/4 food at my disposal, and i never have to worry about him getting fat either. <BR> <BR>i started training in kalaragi, and only doing the lif drill &#91;the top drill&#93;.  i did this for 6 months, then moved to goat, and added the drill that gains pow but loses int &#91;dont recall the name; its the 2d on the list&#93; for 3 months.  i then entered e tourney and won, and immediately gave him my best heart - luka&#39;s 3740 composite heart, with 800 -999 in all categories except int &#91;which was 1&#93;.  i continued to train him in the &#43;pow/-int drill until the next tourney, and then entered and won d level. <BR> <BR>by the time of first growth, i had gotten into a groove &#91;or fallen into a rut - you decide&#93;  i alternated feeding nuts, either stem mushrooms or hogsam peach, and vine grass...4/4, 4/4, 2/4.  i did this the rest of his life - the pattern stayed true.  by now, i was able to add blowfish &#91;&#43;&#43;spd/&#43;pow/--int&#93; to the rotation of drills.    blowfish, hole, and the &#43;pow/-int drill as needed, and as tolerated.  once he got to 950&#43; in pow and spd, i moved him to brillia and started doing avalanch &#91;&#43;def/-int&#93; for the rest of his life, until the last few months, when i moved him to morx. <BR> <BR>i only fought in one other tourney his whole life - he died at b level.  he started with 2 techs - swing and pinball, and got gogogo when he got luka&#39;s heart.  in year 3, i got him the flare stone and he learned thundader.   <BR> <BR>the only special thing i did was to go to the light of earth venture either seems healthy or seems a little tired.  then, i reset in light of earth time until he got an item that made him refreshed or very refreshed.  then he came back healthy or full of energy, and i got extra drills in. <BR> <BR>he started out &#34;nice&#34;, but lost that after first growth, and became normal.  maybe it was the additional stress or lack of rest, but when he hit prime, he developed a scrolling box &#34;bad/unfriendly&#34; and kept this for the rest of his life.  it didnt seem to affect his statgain; he never failed from 6 mos until about 4 months left to live...a very steady monster, that cp breed. <BR> <BR>he found 2 accessories - beetle jaws&#91;3&#93; in goat, and buterfly wings&#91;3&#93; in brillia.  acc&#39;d to the prima guide, neither of them does anything.  selfishly, the guy to the far left took and wore them both; the other 2 cp units stayed unaccessorized. <BR> <BR>here is the result:   <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>lif</TD><TD>pow</TD><TD>int</TD><TD>spd</TD><TD>def </TD></TR><TR><TD>999</TD><TD>997</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>997</TD><TD>994</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>techs -pinball&#91;lvl 1&#93;, swing&#91;lvl 4/max&#93;, gogogo&#91;lvl 2&#93;, and thundader&#91;lvl 6&#93;.  magic secrets, intuitive, resists cold, resists heat.  thin.  battle sense = E &#91;!!!&#93;. <BR> <BR>its a long post, but i hope it provides some insight.

 nope.  excaliber21 has a zan which turned out a bit better &#91;same 4 stats maxed, with about 200 more int&#93;, and has posted his raising method in detail.  others have also posted higher stats, but havent set out their method, so they might or might not be legit - its hard to tell.

 Thats really nice, my monster&#39;s never do so well, despite all the training methods i have tried. I have a question though, how did you get such a good heart to give to cc, could you tell us the ancestory? I have never been able to max out more than 2 stats, usually spd and pow, and around 700 lif, 300 def, and 1-200 int. But my monsters seem to do pretty well at winning tourneys, and i usuall have two level 10 techs maxed. My most common method consists of getting a  jade stone, teaching a tech to the monster on its first venture, then giving it a monster heart that maxes out the jade stone tech. then i only fight in festas to move up the ranks. I avoid all un-needed fights and tourneys. once my monster reaches rank s, i train it until it reaches its last growth and becomes elderly, at which point i put it in hibernation and only fight it in the big 5 tourneys.

 i gave him the heart of luka the jell.  composite 3740.  for a long time i was stuck on about 3500, which meant two stats maxed, one almost maxed, and another at 500-700.  2 &#34;methods&#34; enabled me to reach this level...1&#93; the psych0midget et al method of relentlessly allowing one stat to reach 1, then only using drills that reduced that stat during prime; 2&#93; the digmoshmogi inspired idea of resetting during ventures until you get a refreshing item.   <BR> <BR>with luka, i did #2 kind of halfheartedly, and even that allowed me to climb above my previous plateau.  with cc, i did it relentlessly... i made sure that i went to light of earth time &#34;seems healthy&#34; or worse.  then i refused to accept any venture result that did not include something that made him &#34;refreshed&#34; or &#34;very refreshed&#34;.  that gained me another 250 pts to the composite. <BR> <BR>i only fought in childhood...with a non-tourney monster, i would have fought my way to s level in old age, but i wanted to wring out every last point of stats for cc.  i almost never hibernate...i realize that hibernation is a big part of the dmm method, in its fullest sense, but it still seems like a lot of trouble to me. oh well - maybe next monster.

 Great monster Torey! I didn&#39;t see it posted anywhere, but how long did cc live? I&#39;m wondering if the digmoshmogi method you used made cc loose any extra lifespan b/c of excess stress after the ventures.

 thanx excaliber!  forgot to mention, cc lived 4 yrs 7 mos.  his first year was rough - besides the fighting, he also got stressed twice when i ued the dmm reset idea - i might want to hold off on that until maturity next time.  so he lived 1 yr 1 mo before first growth, then every stage after that was 1 yr 2 mos.  lisa&#39;s lifespan chart lists 5 yrs 1 mo as the cp max; so besides the month during childhood, i lost another 5 somewhere along the way...2 weeks out of those 20 were battles; so the other 18 is up for grabs - it might be the dmm, or it might be some other factor at work.

 I have submitted my entry, meaning the tourney can now get under way whenever Fenrick has time. My monster will undoubtedly be the loser. It&#39;s a Magi &#40;Joker/?&#41; named Vegas. His stats are 568/412/803/999/366. &#40;I would have ignored Pow entirely, but Jokers don&#39;t have a close Int tech, and i was afraid to enter him with only far &amp; medium techs.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Anyway, with all my experiemnts on lifespans, and helping out with techs, and more &#40;like playing MRA and working on that section&#41;, I just have not focused on hardcore ranching in MR3. I hope everyone has fun at least watching the tourney, and maybe I can do better in a later event.

 Nice name.  &#34;CC&#34; From the cloned cat as you said.  Just curious, what was his max damage in battle?

 against an int monster, he will 999 them if he uses thundader.  against a good pow monster, it is a lot less.  swing can be as little as 100 damage or as much as 300. <BR> <BR>cc can take a hit - the strongest techs against him fail to take him out - int techs do more damage, but never enough to one-hit ko him.  again, the best power techs can only do about 250-300 damage against him.
