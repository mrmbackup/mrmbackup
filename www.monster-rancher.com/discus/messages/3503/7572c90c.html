Monster Rancher can give you hundreds of hours of game play, but you&#39;ve got to remember to take care of your hardware!  <BR> <BR>Save your game frequently, before battles, week 4 before ventures, and after successful ventures are useful places to save. Make sure you are using Sony brand memory cards. Always turn the machine on, then insert your card, and, remove the card before turning the machine off. There&#39;s a power surge when the machine is turned on or off, and it will eventually fry the memory in your card, corrupting the data and making it unusable. Sony warns about this on the back of the blister card that memory cards are sold on, but few people heed the warning. It can be very frustrating to be decades into this game and then have your saves lost!  <BR> <BR>Sony also warns that the cards have a limited life. It is extremely useful to have a backup card that you use rarely, just to keep a save or two in case of total card failure. <BR> <BR>The debate still rages about horizontal or vertical play with the PS2. I have heard reports of the machines scratching discs a lot while vertical. My personal preference is to keep mine horizontal, and I used a level to make sure it&#39;s sitting balanced and even. <BR> <BR>There have been several models of PS2 sold over the years, some tend have laser problems more than others. If every disc you own suddenly makes the standard Mocchi, your laser assembly is probably out of alignment, requiring professional adjustment. <BR> <BR> It&#39;s a good idea to give the machine and yourself a break every few hours. Never pause the game for more than a few minutes. &#40;I&#39;ve seen people put games on pause, turn the tv off and expect to return to a paused game a few days later. They&#39;re more likely to return to dead PS2.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Never put any pressure on the CD tray. Open &amp; shut it as little as possible. It&#39;s not a toy, and the motor that runs it will wear out eventually. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t touch or try to clean the laser eye inside the machine. Taking the casing off the machine is a very bad idea, and voids your warranty. Occasional vacuuming of the grill in front is a good idea.   <BR> <BR>The system can also be knocked out of alignment by being dropped or punched. Please don&#39;t hit your PS2.  <BR> <BR>Be careful in handling your CDs, DVDs and games. If they get scratched they may not work. Always keep them in a clean case, and never touch the bottom. It&#39;s a good idea to get in the habit of holding them by gripping the outer edge lightly along with the edge of the center hole. If your CDs become dirty, there are cleaning kits you can purchase to clean them. <I>&#40;Make sure the kit says it&#39;s safe for PSX discs, some CD kits contain solvents that will destroy the special black plastic PSX CDs are made of.&#41;</I> Blow any dust off before using a cleaner. If you do develop scratches, do not attempt to fix them unless they affect how the game plays. Some scratches can never be repaired; if the gouge is deep enough, it can remove data from the aluminum disc sandwiched inside and nothing can replace that aluminum. There is a device you can buy at software stores to grind out minor scratches. The result won&#39;t be pretty, but works most of the time. It costs about $29.99. Some used game/music stores will also re-surface CDs for $3-$5 per disc. &#40;Some give discounts on volume.&#41; The professional re-surfacing is great, your discs look like new. The only downside to re-surfacing is that it does wear down the disc, so it cannot be done repeatedly. Prevention of scratches is really the best overall advice.  <BR> <BR>Use Sony brand or Sony licensed &#40;with the sony logo on the package&#41; controllers. Third party items, manufactured without Sony&#39;s approval may not meet the exact engineering specs of the system. It&#39;s fairly common to see PSX systems with the controller ports burnt out because of bad third party controllers. It&#39;s not worth losing your system to save 5 bucks on a controller.  <BR> <BR>Make sure your system is plugged into a surge supressor. Seemingly minor power fluctuations can be fatal to your system. Also, make sure that if you live in an older home, that your power supply for the building is grounded, if not, even with a surge suppessor, fireworks are possible. &#40;Seen this actually happen last year!&#41; <BR> <BR>If you take the time to take care of your hardware you&#39;ll enjoy a long life of carefree gaming!
