 Don&#39;t any of you know that if you keep your monsters stats even that will do better at everything they do from training to tournment battles .Just because max out a few stats does&#39;nt make them unstoppable.A monster that stats are all around 550 then one of the monster with stats around 800 and INT less then 100 will still be destroyed because the even stat monster does&#39;nt have any weakness unlike the dumb as a rock monster you made . I made a zan that stats are all around 550 and has K.O.d every monster from the super DEF&amp;STR to the super SPD&amp;INT and died at 5yr 6mon and had a perfect record of 127wins by K.O. and 0losses

 I don&#39;t believe that! especially the part about you Zan living to 5yr 6mon, That is just not possible especially if it fought 127 battles and trained all its stats to 550. Plus when you post anonymously it discredits the believability of you post &#40;in my opinion&#41;. I&#39;m sorry, but i don&#39;t your statement is at all accurate. <BR>I hope i didn&#39;t seem to rash, but this sounds like  the poster is just making stuff up or at least highly exaggerating &#40;sp?&#41;his Zan and experiences.

 1&#93; stats are not the be-all and end-all of who is better among mr3 monsters.  i can conjure up two monsters with exactly equal stats, give good leveled up techs to number 1 and bad low level techs to monster 2, and monster 1 wins a high % of the time. <BR> <BR>2&#93; the reason i let a stat go to 1 is that i get my other stats up higher faster by training in the stat that is left at 1.  in a battle between 2 monsters with all pow techs, i fail to see the difference between the one who is 999/999/1/999/999 &#91;the 1 being in int&#93; and the other who is 999/999/999/999/999.  is there any?

 A message to &#34;Anonymous&#34;...  <BR> <BR>Why don&#39;t you fight in an Online tournament... and see how well your &#34;Average&#34; monster does against those mosnters with a couple of maxxed stats? <BR> <BR>I believe you will find that in battles raised and fought against other PEOPLE&#39;S monsters &#40;not in game&#41; a couple of maxxed stats is quite important.

 Agreed. In every MR game so far, well-rounded monsters fare far worse than ones with carefully chosen strengths and weaknesses.  <BR> <BR>Ignoring Int, for example can be very useful if you have not equipped any Int techs on your monster. Or, if a monster has a statgain of 1 in a particular stat, it&#39;s far better to ignore it, and do drills in a stat it&#39;s better at -getting yourself maybe 16s each week instead of 3s, adding to significantly to your points in a better stat.

 Ignoring Int can also be a painful experience if you go up against a Pixie or Lesione or any sort of Int - type monsters as Int doesn&#39;t just increase the damage dealt by Int based attacks, it also decreases the damage taken by Int based attacks.

 But if your Def, Lif, and Spd are high enough you shouldn&#39;t have any problem...If you get unlucky and lose, RESET!

I think the whole point of this post is being miss understood. <BR> <BR>This method was posted by me as an alternative to raising methods that require extreme methods, and possibly testing ones patience to continue to play the game. <BR> <BR>Also this is for the n00bs jsut starting out in the game that may not understand General MR raising tips, and will help them specifically for MR3 to crush the opposition and beat the game, all the while not costing Nearly as much as previous Training Methods. <BR> <BR>there will be flaws to any training method, and each method that is out there will be preferable to one person while not preferred by another for reasons such as &#34;Not high enough stats&#34; or &#34;takes too long&#34;. <BR> <BR>This is just &#34;another&#34; possible training method that Works for what it is intended to do, and requires minimal time and money. <BR>:&#41; <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Monster Fenrick</FONT>

 I have.  It was Talon&#40;1&#41;, my very first MR3 monster.  I&#39;d been playing MR2 for so long, and was so head-strong in my training, that the poor thing was accidentally driven into the ground.  I think failure was his way of rebelling, hahah ^_^ <BR> <BR>Speaking of which, just for references, Talon&#40;3&#41; is still in the works, following a completely new bloodline &#40;now that I have an idea how to train&#41;.  I&#39;m still deciding, but he&#39;ll either be a Gryphon, Garuda, or Gai; one of those three. <BR> <BR>In any case, great job on the quick fix raising guide, MF ^_^

 Sometimes you will rest your monster 2 or 3 weeks in a row.  you don&#39;t WAIT for a Failure to rest, you simply are substituting Rest for Failure. <BR> <BR>In 3 months &#40;12 weeks&#41;.. say you need to rest your Monster 3 times... and it also Fails 4 times. leaving you with only 5 weeks of training time. <BR> <BR>By substituting the Failures with rests you increase your Potential training weeks from 5 to 8 or 9... Stretch this over a year.. or over the lifespan of the monster and it DOES make a difference and will take a lot less time to raise a monster. <BR> <BR>Sometimes a rest instead of a Failure is enough to bring down the total # of failures than normal.  Stretch this formula over the years of a Monsters Life and you get Many more weeks of training than you would without replacing failures with rest. <BR> <BR>I hope this is making sense
