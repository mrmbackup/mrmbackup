<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
I just posted a thread in the FAQ on lifespan research. Please read it first before posting in this thread. Any off topic comments in this thread will be deleted promptly. <BR> <BR>Ok, I have started working on finding out lifespans for monsters in the game. Clearly there are a lot of variables involved, and hopefully I have created enough restrictions on method to eleiminate most of those variables. I intend to test the &#34;Main&#34; breed of species first: the ones who have the same names as the breed as a whole. Then eventually, we will work on sub-breeds. <BR> <BR>Some notes, based on my lifespan experiments in the past: <BR> It is critical to shrine each monster anew each time. Do not shrine a monster freeze, then save, then repeatedly raise from that save. If there is a random factor at the shrine, or a season factor, you will only duplicate mistakes. <BR> <BR>Feed the most nutritious/best liked food when possible, except don&#39;t feed the evolution foods. They could alter lifespan if the sub-breed has a different life pattern. Don&#39;t feed &#34;Nothing&#34; because I suspect it may be stressful. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t use monsters off CDs, in MR2 they have lifespans set very differently than the charts for monsters gotten through combinations. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I need people to double-check my results, and start testing other breeds - this is gonna take a while to complete! <BR> <BR>-And somewhere along the way one of may discover what if any limit there is for heart crystal storage!

 Oh, Lisa, since this was your project......Uhhh.....I have an idea. Anyway I was thinking that before people start doing monsters, they should post the monster they are going to do. For example, let&#39;s say that there are two people working on this. One says they are going to do a tiger. The other person will know that and will concentrate on another monster and won&#39;t be doing a Tiger, too&#40;Even though two people doing the same monster isn&#39;t very likely, when there are more people that can happen&#41;. Just an idea and since this is your project, you can accept the idea, or you can pay no attention to it at all. Just a thought.

My Naga is at its 3rd growth stage. I created a short part of a story with its characteristics. Here are some of its characteristics: Greedy, Selfish, Gourment, Sore Looser. Let&#39;s face it. My Naga is a spoiled brat. Anyway: <BR>So Naga lost a battle and again was a sore looser&#40;sore looser&#41;. We went home and he was very picky with his food&#40;Gourment&#41;. &#34;I want this.

 The thing is, now, after raising 6 pairs of monsters, one of each in a different locale, it really doesn&#39;t seem to matter. Locale may matter in terms of drills that are appropriate for certain breeds&#39; statgain patterns, or the fact that some breeds don&#39;t evolve in some areas, or the fact that in some areas, some breeds don&#39;t ever seem to have good food at all. <BR> <BR>I am almost convinced food doesn&#39;t matter, but need to try one monster with food and another of the same breed with the no food option to be sure. &#40;I have already tested 4/4 food for a monsters&#39; whole life vs. 2/1 food its whole life, and that does not affect lifespan. This is why raising 2 of each breed is useful.&#41; I am certain that no food outright adds lifespan already, because if it did we would be seeing some people&#39;s monsters with wildly differing lifespans.  <BR> <BR>The lowest increment the game can tick away, up or down is one week, since everything is calculated anew every week. &#40;see the lifespan index posts for MR2 in the MR2 FAQ, &#34;The Effects Of Stress&#34;&#41; If a food added a week of life, that would be 12 extra weeks times 4&#43; years, PLUS 12 more weeks for food fed during the extra 48 week year created by the food, PLUS 3 more weeks for food fed during the extra 12 weeks. Anyway, someone would have had a monster live well over 5 or 6 years now, regardless of breed. So far the only 5 year monster is Plant.

So we don&#39;t have to list food, or region right? Then I&#39;ll train the monster from the area it &#39;comes&#39; from. So what we are really doing is how long they lived, right? If you say so. <BR> <BR>For some reason, even if its wrong, I&#39;m thinking the &#39;Nothing&#39;&#40;for food, that is&#41;may not be so good to use while raising.  <BR> <BR>What I think WILL effect lifespan are the items you can bye, the ones that you can use once&#40;Meaning not stones or goblets&#41;. For some reason I think this is what might really affect lifespan. <BR> <BR>Anyway, my tiger just passed its 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Growth spurt so be expecting it. <FONT COLOR="ff0000">:&#41;</FONT> <FONT COLOR="aa00aa">:&#41;</FONT> <FONT COLOR="0077aa">:&#41;</FONT>

 I suspect that &#34;nothing&#34; for food may eventually cause enough stress for a monster to lose lifespan, after long periods of feeding nothing else, like scolding in MR2. There might be an item in the item shop that adds to lifespan, one of the items you feed the monster, but we don&#39;t know yet. <BR> <BR>And yes, raisning cash does become an issue after raising a bunch of monsters who do nothing but sleep. I try to play another moneymaker monster in between each monster I raise; so that it makes at least 9,000g profit before going back into the freezer. That&#39;s why I have been so slow at this. I also did some of my monsters twice, just to check my results. &#40;For example Zoom&#41; <BR> <BR>I am also trimming this thread as we go, so it&#39;s not such a bandwidth hog.

 Henger is next. I also re-raised 3 monsters I had done previously &#40;Joker, Dakkung, Hare&#41; and fed them a heart crystal in week one. There was no change in lifespan.

 I double-checked Naga &#40;originally tested by Crystal Pixie&#41; for two reasons: I thought it would be good to get independent confirmation about the data, and because a person at another board is claiming to have a Naga with a much greater lifespan than our chart showed. Well, I got the exact same results &#40;4y 2m 2w&#41; as Crystal Pixie. So, either there&#39;s some people relying on poor memory for their posts or they have discovered a life-extending item. &#40;or they are shining every one on...&#41;

Ok, taking a break before the Lesione &#40;which will be next, really!&#41; I ran a small test.  <BR> <BR>I took a Naga &#40;Naga/Kalaragi&#41; and evolved him in Brillia. Then raised him til he died. Then raised a Ryozan &#40;Naga/Brillia&#41;, the type I just evolved, from the encyclopedia until it died. <BR> <BR>As you may recall, Crystal Pixie raised the original Naga/Kalaragi for our lifespan chart. I then checked that data. My numbers agree with hers. <BR> <BR>here are my results: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Naga/K</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">1y 1m</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">2y 1m 3w</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">3y 2m 2w</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">4y 2m 2w</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Naga &#40;Naga/K&#41; evolved to Ryozan</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">1y 1m</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">2y 1m 3w</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">3y 2m 2w</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">4y 2m 2w</FONT>  </TD></TR><TR><TD>Ryozan &#40;Naga/B&#41;</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">1y 1m</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">2y 1m 3w</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">3y 2m 2w</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">4y 2m 2w</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>So, in conclusion, this one sub-breed appears to have the same lifespan as the main type and it is unaffected by evolution. I did notice food values were different &#40;I raised both in Brillia&#41; for the evolved monster and the Ryogan pulled from the encyclopedia, so there are some sorts of nature differences.

 I have noticed, that the easier you are on your monster the longer it lives, so the faster you can get the raising method bar to say &#34;lenient&#34; the longer the monster will live &#40;assuming the bar always stays at lenient once it is achived&#41;. So what i am currently trying to test is whether i can get a monster to live longer than lisa&#39;s monsters, by not only having it sleep all the time, but also by only feeding it, its favorite food everytime. I also will see if i can increase these affects by rotating the monster&#39;s fav food if it has two foods that i likes a lot, such as how hengar&#39;s love vinegrass and nuts. One problem that i have to keep in mind, is whether weight affects lifespan.  <BR> I wonder if a monster would live even longer if i had it sleep all the time, and fed it its fav food, and when it gains weight, i feed it diet grass, but first in need to find a monster that loves diet grass. I also need to build up a lot of money so that i can afford this experiment.

 Just finished off a pair of Garuda &#40;Durahan/Takrama&#41;.  My data precisely correlates with what Lisa was suggesting <BR> <BR>First growth: 1.3yrs <BR> <BR>Second: 2.6yrs <BR> <BR>Third: 3.9yrs <BR> <BR>Passed away: 5.2yrs, 2wks <BR> <BR>I was originally worried that having the  &#34;Weirdo&#34; characteristic was going to affect the lifespan of the monsters, indirectly.  However, this proved not to be the case, since my dates are spot-on with what you have listed for a pure Durahan. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to do the Raiden family next, as I have all except /Goat and the ellusive Cowbird.  I suspect that what you stumbled onto with your Naga is the inevitable truth; no sub-type of monster has a lifespan advantage over the main breed of that type.  If so, Garuda would have lived much longer &#40;if you remember, I got my MR2 Garuda to 10.5yrs, while a pure only made something like 5.6yrs&#41;.  Anyways, I&#39;m rambling, but that&#39;s the data.
