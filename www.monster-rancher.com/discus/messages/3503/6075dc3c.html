 I am currently raising a bunch of monsters to check the lifespans. I am simply having them rest their whole lives, and when venture time comes, I buy the 0g RanRan, and hit START as soon as possible to end the venture fast, without ever moving the monster around. I have noticed that some of the monsters have aquired characteristics. I started writing it down with my last monster, a Pancho. It started with all blank spots in the characteristics chart, in view mode. I was raised in Takrama. Right before death, I looked, and it had &#34;resists cold&#34; and &#34;perceptive&#34; in the chart. It&#39;s nature had shifted from &#34;Timid&#34; to &#34;Hesitant&#34;.

About characteristics. You know in the front near the bonds there&#39;s this place? I&#39;ll say it&#39;s a peronality box. The section where they list characteristics I will call the characteristics section. Lisa, you already know I&#39;m working on lifespan research. While I was doing a Naga I noticed something in its characteristics section. As you probobly already know, you can have more than one peronality trait for the box. When this happens, One of the peronality traits gets send to the characteristics section. That&#39;s how you can tell what it is.&#40;I posted a few characteristics in the other post about characteristics&#41;My Naga started with combative in the pesonality box. In its 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Growth, it gained the pesonality Greedy. It said Greedy-&#34;I want this. Oh and this, too.&#34; In my Naga&#39;s 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Growth, its Greedy went into the personality box, while combative went into the characteristics section. It read: Combative-&#34;Doesn&#39;t anyone want to fight me? I guess we can find out what peronality&#39;s mean.

there are a couple of things this could mean.   <BR> <BR>1&#93; certain monsters have certain characteristics &#91;and/or personality traits&#93; hardwired, and they will develop those characteristics &#91;and/or personality traits&#93; no matter what you do. <BR> <BR>2&#93; certain monsters have a tendency to develop in a certain way, and , <B>unless you do something to change or prevent it</B>, they will develop certain characteristics/personality traits. <BR> <BR>one of the things someone could do, &#91;like me, if i finish doing the things i am doing&#93;, is raise one of these all rest monsters and try to take steps to prevent that characteristic/trait from emerging.  if you can&#39;t, then 1 is true; if you can, then it&#39;s 2.

 I have noticed that when I would scold my Momo a characteristic would pop up such as independent and would flip over to bad... Im sorry if this has nothing to do with this just thought I would mention it.... <BR>By the way I would have to go with 2.... But I have never really raised two of the same monsters so I wouldn&#39;t know....

 I found out something interesting last night while playing. I looked at my Suzarin&#92;Brillia right before she evolved. She had Clean, Resists Heat&#40;before I unlocked the desert area&#41;, Sore Loser, and Charming Eye. She evolved and lost Clean, gained Resists Cold &amp; Perfectionist. I reloaded again, and she didn&#39;t get the Resists Cold, but she still lost Clean, received Perfectionist, Strong Heart, &amp; Confident. So apparently if you&#39;ve saved before they evolve&#40;for me it was the day before&#41;, you may get some new characteristics when you load.

 I think I have an idea what the good/bad flipping is.  I wondered about this when I first saw it, but never seemed to have enough of a chance to observe until now.  I&#39;ve raised a &#34;market&#34; Zuum with &#34;Honest&#34; and an Ootan that was &#34;Independent&#34;.  Thus far, from what I&#39;ve observed, it&#39;s the game&#39;s visual response to how you, as the trainer, are affecting that particular trait. <BR> <BR>Ex:  My Zoom likes &#34;Salmon&#34; &#40;Brilla region&#41;, so I feed it that.  The flipping goes to &#34;good,&#34; indicating that my monster and I comply with this, and it MAY continue to keep that trait when it evolves &#40;though doubtful&#41;. <BR> <BR>Next, my Ootan fails and I tell it &#34;Keep it up!&#34;  Well, that&#39;s a negative reaction to the &#34;Independent&#34; trait, since it&#39;s realying on my coaching and praise, thus flipping it to the bad.  HOWEVER, if I take the exact same situation and tell it &#34;No big deal,&#34; the &#34;Independent&#34; trait is reinforced, leading to less stress, but more unruliness on the monster&#39;s part. <BR> <BR>I hope this clears at least a LITTLE bit of it up, if it hadn&#39;t already been.
