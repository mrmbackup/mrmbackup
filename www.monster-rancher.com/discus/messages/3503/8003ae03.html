 Did any of you notice that your rivals always raise their monsters in 1 or 2 categories, preferably speed???? My one rival had a Durahan with 800&#43; speed who sukked because of armor. Have you noticed this????

 I once had the golem guy &#40;now what&#39;s his name again?&#41;raise a golem/brillia. He entered in the S tournament &#40;where you fight one of the four? monsters; such as radiance&#41;but that&#39;s not important. His defence sucked because he had like 900&#43; speed. Opponents really aren&#39;t smart...

 It&#39;s Lus who is the &#39;old desert guy&#39;. I&#39;m thinking of making a chart listing all of the monsters I&#39;ve seen Rivals raise and their lowest/highest stats I&#39;ve seen them at. Others&#39; help would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Another stupid rival thing is that I&#39;ve often battled them on an official tourney and won, then went to the next of a higher level and they were there.... But they didn&#39;t win the tourney and level up....

 i noticed that glitch too khift....maybe your rivals are just losers who are in S but play down...just kidding.....i&#39;ve seen rivals with 999 in speed and one monster had 69&#40;hehe...sixety-nine!&#41; defence and 87 life,although high power and speed...i crushed it for 999 every time with my Sicilian&#40; that golem that should be raised in kalaragi...like lemlaria..or something&#41; I just used tornado punch which has good hit and lotsa POW.My lemlaria&#40;Sicilian  had about 550&#43; in speed as well as 650 life and 900&#43; defence...so it could never kill me before tornado punch finally landed..&#41;

 i notice that all the time, too. the rival golems i face all are more like 200,999,200,650,150 and are fighting me at B class. that is annoying because i dont use any of the special methods here and they ko me with 1 or 2 rocket punches.  I only beat them because i&#39;ve noticed the rival only has attacks in the far and close range so i stay in the middle. also, none of my rivals have their monsters best attacks.  i&#39;ve noticed they only have the bit attacks and possibly a stone or two.

 well, stragetically, speed does make sense, as it&#39;s the most dificult stat to counter. some breeds CAN&#39;T counter it. the only way for them to win is luck. POW and/or INT for LIF and/or DEF and vise versa. however, speed is exclude out of that, as the only thing that really determines weather or not you hit them is HIT for a move, which you can raise a limited amount, and sometimes not at all. and some breeds don&#39;t have any accurate moves! which is annoying... <BR> <BR>Btw Can any one think of a decent name? I stink at thinking of names...

 OT Hey, works for me. alot better than the name i normaly use. I&#39;ve used it so often, I&#39;ve gotten sick of it.  <BR> <BR>Chozen1 <BR> <BR>Sadly, thats the most creative and original name I&#39;ve ever come up. Thankfuly, I still have plenty of time to work on my skill with naming. After all, I am only 13. Lets just hope it doesn&#39;t come up to much for me, if at all, outside of games... <BR> <BR>On Topic <BR>Lus is very strange. for me I once encountered lemlaria of his with like 200 life &#40;rounded up&#41; <BR>800 power, not sure how much intellegence, 600 speed, and a whopping 100 defense!

Lus didnt land a hit &#40;heh like 8 seconds into the match it was over tho&#41;
