 Well, there was a recent conversation on here about one breed being better than another and that same topic comes up all over.  Now there are tons of things that go into raising a breed &#40;amiability, stat gain patterns, lifespans...etc&#41;, but I live in a world where all things are good.  So I&#39;ve decided to test, to the best of my ability if one specific breed is better for tourneys than others.   <BR> <BR>On the thread, the general consensus was that Mew may have an advantage over other breeds based on 2 attacks &#40;Cat Fool and Cat Fan&#41;.  When maxed, these attacks have a hit of 70 and 63 respectfully.  By far the best &#34;hit&#34; numbers in the game.  Additionally, the move Hawaiian is frustrating and can be used from 2 separate distances.  So, I am presently raising a Mewsneak using the dmm/campster method &#40;the raising part is just for fun&#41; and she is almost done.  When complete, she will be at 999 in every category.  Techs will all be maxed out.  This is the control group.  I will save her vs. data. <BR> <BR>Then I will shrine a Zan and give him the 4 most desirable techs I can come up with &#40;suggestions please&#41; and edit the game save by swapping the mew&#39;s stats, battle sense, tech levels and characteristics to the Zan.  This technically would make them equals, minus the techs.  Then the 50 battle test should suffice.  I will also battle her against a Joker, Harry, Reilly, Sophia and CC making the same modifications.  Any other breed suggestions are welcome but I&#39;m not gonna get crazy here. <BR> <BR>At least this may give us an idea if one breed does have an advantage.  The battles should start in a couple of days.

 monster rancher games have always thrived on contrasting principles...&#34;tanks&#34; vs &#34;speed demons&#34;; pow vs int; guts regen vs guts factor; etc. <BR> <BR>the mew is a good choice.  however, my choice of an &#34;anti-mew&#34; would be a colorpandora, with intuitive and swing.  give him all maxxed stats, just for the defensive help that max int would give.  let the mew have the wide array of techs.  give my guy dodging ability and that one maddening, but highly efficient, little tech. <BR> <BR>wonder who would win?

 Actually Torey, that&#39;s the funny part.  I was planning on giving identical characteristics too.  In MR3, technically every monster can gain every characteristic &#40;ie. the fenrick encyclopedia has a mocchi that starts with Jell Body&#41;.  So Giving C.C. different characteristics kind of defeats my purpose but C.C. is a great choice.  The guts regen is nearly identical, and the move types are extremely similar, but these high hit ratios for Mew makes it seem to me to counter those typical CP benefits.  Then again I may be wrong, but the little bugger &#40;named Holly&#41; has been almost flawless in random venture battles hitting and dodging.

 ya - you are right, chars must be identical.  i still will try to counter a high% hardhitting &#91;but costly&#93; tech with the best available least cost tech.  if not cp&#39;s swing, i believe jell charge is also a possibility - 51 hit% and 15 damage for only 11 guts.  plus jell has &#34;jell body&#34;, a defensive plus which cannot be passed to any other breed &#91;unless sharkport could do it artificially&#93;. <BR> <BR>&#42;sigh&#42; so many variables...

 yep, but if you read above, it can be started with...there&#39;s a mocchi that does. <BR> <BR>No different than armor, tough skin or thick fur &#40;though I don&#39;t know if the effect is completely identical by amount&#41;. <BR> <BR>As far as countering, that&#39;s what makes Mew so interesting to me.  Hawaiian costs 21 guts &#40;though the hit is only 46&#41;.  She has a guts regen of 125.  Jell and CP have gets regen of 70-75, mogi 85.  So the typical suspects eventually lose the guts battle too.  The only breeds with higher guts regen are Pixie, Plant and Octopee.  Since Mew has almost twice the guts as those two, she can afford moves with twice the guts cost.  Pancho and Psiroller are the same &#40;at 125ish&#41;, everyone else is lower.  She is technically tied for 4th in this category and 23 other monsters guts regen are worse.  She has the highest 2 hit chance moves and an incredible value guts killer move &#40;maxed hawaiian is 42 guts taker, 21 guts cost&#41;. <BR> <BR>By the way, the 4th move is Zap  41, 19,22,57 when maxed.  that&#39;s 57 hit.  3 techs 57 and higher.  At least I can tell my wife it was worth it when I&#39;m sleeping on the couch.  God I hope I&#39;m not wrong about this.

 the only flaw in the mew tech array you have listed above is the high guts cost.  i have been squaring monsters off for a while now, and i am sick of cc swinging foes to death.  the foes have better techs in terms of hit%, gutsdown, and damage...but they never get them off cuz they hit cc once and then the rest of the match is cc swinging. <BR> <BR>you have a tough call with hawaiian, though.  using the computer ai, hawaiian will get used to the exclusion of all your other beautiful techs because of the fact that it only costs 21 and it is in two ranges.  but if you leave it out, your lowest tech in cost is 37 guts...leaving you vulnerable to the swings of the world. <BR> <BR>&#91;parenthetically, hawaiian will always be my favorite tech to have used against me...i love watching that goofy little cat doll do its goofy dance inside the swirling cirlces.  easily entertained?  that is so me, i should have it on my business card.&#93; <BR> <BR>mew may well end up being the number one breed in computer battles.  i wouldn&#39;t bet against it, that&#39;s for sure.  but there may be other voices heard from before the mythical trophy is handed out.

 I don&#39;t believe ever monster can have Light Aura, when Halo evolved into a Night Flyer she lost Light Aura, and i rebooted. I really don&#39;t think ever char is attainable by every monster. Most probably are though

 BTW, i believe the test might be more effective if the monsters being tested had no chars at all.

 I thought of that actually.  but it&#39;s alot harder to add characteristics hacking the save than removing &#40;it&#39;s checksum&#39;d so rearranging is easier than removing&#41;...but will do.  Was just being lazy.

 Jell body is not just like armor, thick fur, etc. The difference is that jell body only lowers &#34;hit&#34; damage if i remember correctly. Now the question is, what is &#34;hit&#34; damage? I believe its beat, pound, cut, type damage, but haven&#39;t done an experiment on it. <BR>As far as the kitty project goes, i wish you luck, but I suspect that your Mew, while being a very good monster, will not be a monster that can prove Mew has a noticeable advantage over EVERY monster breed. I think that above average hit % isn&#39;t going to do it, and thats the only category thats head and shoulders above the other breeds. The guts regen is negated by the cost of the attacks. Its definately an impressive array, but i believe a balance between guts regen and efficiency in techs will hold some of the best monsters for comp vs. comp tournies.  I don&#39;t want to speculate on this matter anymore, as its too easy to say &#34;i think&#34; and &#34;i believe&#34;, but i&#39;m sure your project to create the &#34;ultimate&#34; monster will lead to some interesting discoveries.

 I know this took a long time, but I experienced technical difficulties in beginning it.  Kitty is done.  Primary result was good. <BR> <BR>Kitty Handled all 4 maxed monsters &#40;2 of Toreys and 2 of mine&#41; and quite handly &#40;actually, CC wasn&#39;t totally maxed, but a good test&#41;.  However, characteristics and form weren&#39;t the same on all monsters.  So I&#39;ll manipulate those soon enough and do so again.  Monsters were of the Moochi, Suzurin, Suezo and Color Pandora variety.
