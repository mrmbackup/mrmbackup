 Okay, I wasn&#39;t sure where this should go so I started a new thread.  <BR> <BR>Well anyways, I was raising a Ogyo and it developed the trait &#39;Gourmet&#39;. I did eveything I could to get rid of this annoying characteristic but by the time my monster died she still had it. I was happy to see that it didn&#39;t show upon the heart though.  <BR> <BR>So I decided to raise a Goat Gitan next and I gave it the heart, and no gourmet. So I kept on playing but I found out that the orb I had grabbed was the same as the move my gitan got from the heart. Now I wanted to start out with four moves so I loaded my second save that I made right before I gave it the heart and froze it. I brought out another monster and decided to us it to find a bunch of stones and orbs and then use them on some of my favorite monsters, keeping them frozen in the meantime.  <BR> <BR>Well part way through this I decided to test my hearts out on some of the monsters to see which hearts would work best with each monster. I ended up finding my ogyo&#39;s heart worked best on my gitan, but now no matter how many times I reloaded and gave the heart to him he would get gourmet. Even though it wasn&#39;t listed on the heart. I knew it hadn&#39;t given that trait before so I was a little upset at this, because otherwise it was a great heart. <BR> <BR>So I gave up and didn&#39;t use any hearts, went back to getting orbs and played until that monster got what I needed and died.  <BR> <BR>I pulled out my gitan and decided to try the heart again and found out that gourmet had dissapeared. Even reloading abunch of times to make sure I got another trait didn&#39;t make it show up at all. <BR> <BR>Well I&#39;m not sure if this info will help you but I thought that some of you might find this observation interesting, and maybe even helpful.

 You do know it&#39;s better to use the Orb that gives the Heart&#39;s skill before the heart itself is given, right? <BR> <BR>Say... you raise a Dragon, its forte is a maxed Salamander &#40;let&#39;s say that comes from a Fire Orb&#41;. Then, if you give a Fire Orb to a monster BEFORE the heart, the monster will have the Fire Orb tech maxed. This is better than having a level one tech by a long shot. <BR> <BR>Oh, and for what you say: sounds about right, no one really knows how characteristics are passed in specific terms, and it&#39;s been reported before that they can skip generations if the heart is &#34;full.&#34; <BR> <BR>-Kevin
