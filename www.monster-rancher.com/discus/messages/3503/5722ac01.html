 not quite as impressive as a 23-year-old golem, i realize, but after a string of monsters that made it seem like lifespans were lumped into a very narrow range &#91;roughly 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 yrs&#93;, it was great to train a monster who broke the mold. <BR> <BR>when i saw he had clorophyl/good, and i knew that he was only going to be a heart monster for my int monster division, i dedcided to do everything i could to make my plant live as long as it could.  i am not good enough to make it happen every time, but all but 3-4 times/year i kept him from ever being tired.  i had the 25,000 g goblet and stone.  i rotated his diet &#91;even after he became a vegetarian&#93; and battled him not too few but not too many times. <BR> <BR>he grew first &#91;and evolved&#93; at 1 yr 3 mo.  he hit his prime at 2 yr 6 mo.  he grew old at 3 yr 10 mo.  so the lockstep of stages john and i discussed at chat last night continued, just every stage had 3 more months in it. <BR> <BR>as for plants, they rock big time.  drain is the first attack of its type i have gotten in this game, and once i leveled it up, i developed high lif, and pretty much let the other guys pummel me for the first 30 seconds, then moved in and used drain, which took it all back, with interest!  right out of the encyclopedia, no heart added, he beat 3 out of the maj5. <BR> <BR>oh, the five year song is &#34;through the years/&#91;eddie&#93; has no more fears&#34;.  doesnt even qualify as doggerel, but i was cheering to hear it all the same.

 GJ TOREY, im training a plant right now. but he&#39;s wholey USELESS because his only int tech is dance &#40;or whatever&#41; which can do a WHOPING FOUR damage and take away alot of guts. im trying to teach him seed gatling or pollen, but so far unsuccesfully. :&#40; BTW he&#39;s still fairly young, and with no heart has half decent stats

 ya - its flower dance &#91;i am correcting the table&#93; and i hated it...never used it.  pollen is a very nice tech.  if there&#39;s any way at all to go to goat and get the aqua orb, do so - drain is the answer to all your plant problems.

You think your Plant had a long lifespan?? Mine lived for <B>TWO YEARS!!</B> <BR> <BR>But training him made me realize just how awesome Plants are.  Despite the fact that he never had any sleep in his life at all, he continued to succeed in heavy drills occassionally, and got some pretty sweet stat gains, even in its youth.  Lif, Int, Spd, and THE best Guts Recovery are one awesome combination. <BR> <BR>- <B>DarkDragon</B>

 1&#93;  i had the cheap goblet and stone. <BR> <BR>2&#93;  i gave it no accessories <BR> <BR>3&#93;  i trained mostly to looks healthy - a few times each year, it would drop to a little tired.
