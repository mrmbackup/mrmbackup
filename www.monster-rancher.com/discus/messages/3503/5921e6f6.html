 I gave my jade orb to the lord, and my pixie learned element guard.  other monsters have this kind of thing too, like henger with rayfield.  i tried to use it a few times, and i do not see the benefit.  i would be surrounded by light, and get dispair, but it only lasted until either the enemy or i launched a new tech.  she had high speed anyway, so she dodged/blocked most attacks without it.  maybe i was using it wrong, but it seemed like a waste of guts to me. <BR> <BR>anyone have any tips on the best use of techs of this type?

 I&#39;ve wondered about Ray Field, too.  When the enemy has used it, I&#39;ve noticed no difference in the amount of damage he receives, and I&#39;ve never had trouble hitting him with that up...though maybe it&#39;s because I thoroughly outclass him in speed.  Maybe this move blocks withering &#40;Guts Down&#41;?

 I can&#39;t really tell either about elemental guard.  The first time I used it, it lasted for about 10 secs and computer missed about 4 straight attacks.  I don&#39;t know if it caused them to miss or what.  But another time, it only lasted for 1 attack.  It could&#39;ve been because I possibly attacked him.  Since the first time I used it, I was just sitting there to see what it did.  But after a while, I think it&#39;s a waste of guts too. <BR> <BR>Especially when you let the ai play for you.  &#34;Stop casting Elemental guard dammit! argh! It missed too!&#34;  It&#39;s even worse since it&#39;s in all 3 ranges.  It&#39;s like the pixie&#39;s pat and kick all over again ;p

 Here&#39;s a hypothesis. Element Guard protects against the extra damage caused by some techs like the Lightning tied to Mega Blade for Hengar or the Flame&#40;Fire?&#41; from Golem&#39;s Olega Meteor. It may also reduce the chance of Critical hits.

 I just had a way different experience with Ray Field.  I was fighting the Hengar/Kalaragi in B-rank that uses it, and I was using my Usazo.  He used Ray Field twice in a row.  Then, for the rest of the fight, my Sharp Eyes Suezo breed, who had almost double his Speed &#40;about 500 to 250&#41;, COULDN&#39;T TOUCH HIM!  Even with his most accurate moves at 90 Guts!  And believe me, I TRIED!  That sufficiently impressed me that Ray Field is worth it for Hengars if you give them good Intelligence.

 My Gai has Far Sight that causes the dispair effect. I tried it in battle and it&#39;s obvious: It causes you to dodge no-matter what untill it wears off.

 And it wears off until the monster that cast dispair can&#39;t dogde the enemy&#39;s attack. like it won&#39;t use the dispair if your monster actually dodge the attack, and the attack that the enemy supposed to hit you will not succed because you used dispair.it only last for one hit though. it has nothing to do with time.i had already try it in the versus mode, but at least that is for pixie/brillia. i don&#39;t know for Zan.

 I remember once during the Brillia Great 5 battle, there was a rare breed of Henger that completely outclassed my monster, but it just sat there doing Ray Field and wasting all it&#39;s guts. In between Ray Fields, I pounded it with Lightning and Strong Gust seeing absolutely no difference except for the amount of guts the Henger had left. I even noticed that I was hitting a little bit more often than normal. Just my experience.

 Maybe for every Monster it has a different effect..... <BR> <BR>Such as far sight may make them dodge no matter what. <BR> <BR>I think this is very possible.

 from my experience with my hengar who only had 350 int. points, rayfield reduced the damage taken but not the guts down.  before using the ray field babylon&#39;s &#40;dragon/takrama from class S&#41; dragon tail attack did 100 damage on average, but afterwards only did 70 or less.  the rayfield was maxed out &#40;lv.3&#41; but in my opinion was worth the 9 guts.

 Yesterday, while milking my Tanuzo of money via Great 5, I fought an interesting battle with Radience the Valkrie &#40;Pixie/???&#41;. He started out with Element Guard and it worked, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn&#39;t land a blow on him. He didn&#39;t hit me, either, but I noticed a difference. Normally I Ko him pretty durn fast.

 Not Radience. Valkries have an obviously male figure.

 3 points in response: <BR> <BR>1&#93;  her figure may be youthful &#91;especially in comparison to mr2 pixies&#93; but her hair and facial structure is very feminine; <BR> <BR>2&#93;  valkyries are female in mythology:  Valkyries, - maidens who served Odin as choosers of slain warriors, who were taken to reside in Valhalla <BR> <BR>3&#93;  assuming i am wrong, then valkyrie is a...is a...no, i can&#39;t bring myself to say it!

 just a theory here, but since those defensive attacks have a hit percentage, then maybe if they &#34;hit&#34; they will always block/dodge &#40;until the user attacks&#41;, but if they &#34;miss&#34; then nothing happens except the loss of guts.

 Oh. Now that I think about it, you&#39;re right Torey. The only thing is that Radiance looks male... I guess just to me.
