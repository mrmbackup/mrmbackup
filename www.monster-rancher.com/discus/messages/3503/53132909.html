 First, I don&#39;t know if this is documented, but I didn&#39;t find it. Sorry if you all know this. To view your monster:  <BR> <BR>From the main screen press Square to go to the Data screen, then go to &#39;Encyclopedia&#39;. Choose a monster and press Square to view it as in MR2. You can zoom with L1 and L2, the D-pad rotates &#40;on only the vertical axis&#41; and the other buttons show various animations. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m finding DVDs that have exactly the same monster and stats, but one different characteristic. Example: The Jackie Chan movies Who Am I? and Police Story &#40;both imports but different manufacturers&#41; both give the Desert Jell, same exact stats and moves, but one has an extra characteristic. <BR> <BR>Another pair of discs did the same thing, forget what they were, though. <BR> <BR>If we ever find a way to get the subcode from a DVD, this might be helpful in analysis... <BR> <BR>Finally, we got a Pixie with Dimples as a characteristic! Not that exciting, but cute.

One thing that I don&#39;t think has been brought up yet is a very useful characteristic: <B> Radar </B> <BR> <BR>This characteristic I have only found on a Henger and when activated in battle <I> always </I> hits! <BR> <BR>This is an incredible ability in my opinion and I just wanted to make others aware of it. ^_^

 This might be pretty obvious but for those who don&#39;t know it: <BR> <BR>When you &#39;hibernate&#39; &#40;freeze&#41; a monster it will not function as well as it would normally in the next seasonal exploration while doing skill training. Your assistant &#40;forgot her name&#41; mentions this when you try to skill train. <BR> <BR>The obvious reason to me for this is to prevent people from freezing their monsters until just before the seasonal exploration to exploit the skill training.

 This is probably obvious to most everyone by now, but I was worried about it, so I thought I&#39;d mention it: If your monsters die with their accessories on, you don&#39;t lose the accessories &#40;or at least, I haven&#39;t lost any yet&#41;.

 The same goes for evolution, except that when your monster evolves, your accessory will be removed. &#40;You won&#39;t lose it, you&#39;ll just have to put it back on your critter if that subtype can wear it.&#41;

 something interesting but not vital I found out: <BR> <BR>Each Pixie has a different combo of animations.  My Angel had this attitude problem when it was feeding time &#40;Hand held out making a loud sound as if saying &#39;Give me!&#39;&#41; but my fantuger &amp; Windine just did a little jig during feeding time. <BR> <BR>My Farn &amp; Nymph would float cross-legged when they were sucessful in a drill, but my Angel would just pose and my fantuger &amp; Windine would dance. <BR> <BR>I wonder if other Monsters have Animations that vary from species to species.

 Check Encyclopedia and press square button. An angel is different because it opens its eyes when it gets angry&#40;just like the discription&#41;instead of crossing its legs. And other different things.

 Oh when you press the square buttonit displays your monster and you can pree R2 to see how it eats,R1 to see its &#34;Give Me!&#34; the square for it sleeping, O for its angry pose and X for its happy pose.

 I just wanted to mention a pretty unusual characteristic I&#39;ve discorvered and this seemed the best place to do it. <BR> <BR>The characteristic I want to mention is &#39;Groovy Moves&#39;. <BR> <BR>I got this on a Moochi &#40;from a cd which I&#39;ll add to the CD list pretty soon&#41;. <BR> <BR>This move &#39;Slightly improves the damage from dance moves&#39;. <BR> <BR>There are dance moves? Neato! <BR> <BR>Just thought I&#39;d mention it. ^_^

 Yeah, almost all Mogis I&#39;ve seen so far have Groovy Moves as a Characteristic. Must mean something, right?
