 My second Raiden had a bad habit of getting stressed out, so when he pushed my patience, I decided to start trying items.  What I found wasn&#39;t exactly enlightening, but helpful nonetheless. <BR> <BR>&#34;Pretty Flower,&#34; that some trainers have been using to reduce stress, DID NOT WORK, not one little bit!  I&#39;m not certain what these are for, perhaps a deletable item that helps your monster rest better &#40;like an eatable version of the &#34;Aroma Cup&#34;?&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#34;Scorpion Claw,&#34; moved my training style to &#34;Harder,&#34; as the list here suggests, though, I believe I received the same effect from &#34;Bitter Garlic,&#34; making me think that one of these is your &#34;Smoked Snake&#34; for MR3. <BR> <BR>&#34;Monster Nip&#34; had no discernable effects on my monster, or at least none that could be detected without hacking into the numbers. <BR> <BR>&#34;Nitro Juice,&#34; that I had thought to be for fatigue turned out to either be very weak, or for something else.  The way that my current monster is aging, I&#39;m beginning to wonder if this is some sort of cheap medicine, though I doubt it.  One thing is for certain, it does BUPKIS for stress. <BR> <BR>&#34;Coral,&#34; I tried just to be systematic, but found that it DID reduce stress on my monster, as well as being something that it &#34;liked a lot.&#34;  So, until somebody comes up with an MR3 &#34;Mint Leaf,&#34; I suggest hanging onto some &#34;Coral&#34; bits for the long haul.  I SUSPECT &#40;no proof&#41; that this item helps with nutritional value, as well. <BR> <BR>&#34;Black Pearl&#34; was a matter of curiosity.  I&#39;d heard that almost every monster liked this item, and my Raiden seemed to be no exception.  The most obvious effects this item held was both a relief of &#34;stress&#34; as well as a minor boost of &#34;health.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>So, there it is.  Not exactly hard-wired scientific evidence, but it&#39;s a start for anyone else that would like to research closer.  I&#39;ll report more when/if I find anything.  Aside from techniques, my current objective is to find a way to add more accessory points to one&#39;s monster.  I&#39;m almost certain that I&#39;ve seen monsters with three or four items equipped...then again, for all I know it&#39;s their natural look.  Can&#39;t blame me for trying, though ^_^

 Thanks for taking the time to do this! No one right now has the ability to hack the game, so every bit of knowledge will have to be done the &#34;old fashioned way&#34;, ike you just did!

 Well, I believe that things like Pretty Flower, Monster Nip, and Coral work differently depending on the monster.  Some monsters like different ones, and whatever they like reduces stress.  For instance, my Rayrin got a huge kick out of Pretty Flowers, my Tsuboncho and Tanuzo loved Monster Nip, and my Durahan breeds all loved Coral.  I just think they decided to make it so that there was no universal stress-reducer &#40;except maybe Black Pearl&#41; this time around, which makes sense.

 Actually I think the scorpion claw is more like the scorpion dust&#40;or something like that&#41; from the desert exploration of MR1 as it raises their loyalty&#40;bond, whatever&#41;.

 Theoretically, there should be ONE item, even if we haven&#39;t stumbled over it, as of yet.  I can honestly tell you from experience that the following items do not significantly help lifespan in any direct manner. <BR> <BR>Black Pearl <BR>Coral <BR>Saucer Fruit <BR>Tonburi Sap <BR>Nitro Juice <BR>Monster Nip <BR>Diet Grass &#40;duh&#41; <BR>Gassy Potato <BR>Honey Candy <BR>Spicey Cookie <BR>Scorpion Claw <BR>Bitter Garlic

 what does honey candy do, i gave it to my anubis before a tourney, and it performed really well, but when i let it rest after the tourney, it didnt sleep well. is that because of the honey candy or is there something else that affected my anubis&#39;s sleep?

 I haven&#39;t tested in that area, as of yet, Koosen.  I SUSPECT that &#34;Honey Candy&#34; is just plain &#34;Candy&#34; for the MR3 times.  My guess is that it enhances weight gain, but since you mentioned that plausable effect, I&#39;ll watch carefully in future experiments.  It would make sense that TECMO thew us a few curve balls this time.

 i also tried honey candy to see if massive doses of it would add training weeks or lifespan and it did not.  aas to what id &#42;did&#42; do, there was nothing that jumped right out at me, but i wasnt looking for subtle effects, so who knows?

 It&#39;s been aprrox. 1.5 months since my first posting on lifespan, and still no results.  All of these items have me mindboggled, as few seem to do ANYTHING other than persuade Loyalty/Raising Style.  The one jewell that I uncovered was the &#34;Black Pearl&#34; that seems to greatly reduce stress and lower fatigue a hair &#40;or a Strawberry :P&#41;, as was stated far above.  Still, these items are unusually expensive &#40;2-3 times the cost of &#34;Mint Leaf&#34; in MR2&#41; and have no DIRECT correlation with lifespan.  That is, it may help stress, but it doesn&#39;t add any weeks.  It sort of frustrates me, because the &#34;Black Pearl&#34; appears to be an advanced-use item, and isn&#39;t even purchasable intil one gains a few ranks in the game.  This leads me to believe that there has GOT to be a Stress Reducing/Fatigue reducing item of lesser value and price, that we are continually overlooking. <BR> <BR>Then, it hit me.  A long time ago, in one of Celious&#39; &#34;Creative Sessions,&#34; there was a little thing about &#34;if you were a chef, what would you feed your monster.&#34;  I suggested that each item work in accordance to the monster&#39;s species, such as Naga, Zuum, Dragon, etc. would be hurt by say &#34;ice cream&#34; but gain more from hot, spicy, and tough foods.  I researched all of the monster that I have raised and all were either flying, or related to birds.  In addition, 99% were either from Brilla or Morx.  The relevence? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to attempt to get one of each locale for my listing, and try various breeds of the same locale to see if there is any distinguishable differentiations.  In short, I&#39;m branching out from aviary monsters and shooting into the unlikely with monsters such as Psiroller, Mogi, and Golem.  It&#39;ll be a stretch, but hopefully I can pin-point some information of SOME use to verify particular effects of foods.

 So, you&#39;re trying to see if the items have different effects on different monster types? Once I get a little more money I&#39;ll try to help out with it. But now I&#39;m a bit too poor to afford butt-loads of items after my purchase of the two 125k durables.

 Hehehe...understood, and thanks for the hand-up.  This is a huge project, and sadly, I have very little to show for it.  All I know for certain is that the &#34;Black Pearl&#34; item is both good and expecsive.

 I seem to have had some strange things happen to me when I fed my monsters honey candy everytime it was fed one it got a great on it&#39;s drills I have had this happen to some other monsters I have trained in the past I don&#39;t know if honey candy affects the monsters ability to get greats or not but I just wanted to know if this has ever happened to anyone else I did not do any real research on it I am just sharing my experiance I only gave it one when the monster was full of energy.

 one of my feeding experiments involved honey candy.  i was not searching for greats, i was trying to see if nonstop honey candy would allow me to fit in extra weeks of training &#91;i.e., if honey candies eliminated some fatigue and/or stress&#93;.  they didnt.  i did not notice an increase in greats during the time i did my testing - if there would have been a huge increase, i am sure i would have noticed. <BR> <BR>greats happen more often when stress is low, when the monster is in prime, and especially both.  a monster who is full of energy is more likely &#91;but not certain&#93; to be less stressed.  i would think you would not get the greats when your monster seems healthy - but i would be interested in seeing organized results.

 Hmm I will have to do some research on this I will see if I get a great in baby, mature and adult I will also try to get one when I am not full of energy but you are probley right but I do recall doing a drill to check the fatigue lowering effect that the candy is supposed to have and when I was a little tired I did a drill and I was still a little tired after the drill but the fact that it was a LD might have something to do with it I will have to look into it some more I will post results.

 Um... I&#39;m under the impression that items like Pretty Flower, Black Pearl, Coral, etc do not effect stats or training so much as effect the bond between you and your monster. The effect varies on whether the monster likes, really likes, or dislikes the item. For example, when I start a new goat type pixie, they generally really like black pearls. If I give her one on the very first day, it seems the bond between us rises a bit. The same is true, but the rise is less for a pretty flower. I am not sure if multiples of the same item have the same effect in one week, but will check. <BR>Also, I noticed one of my pixies disliked diet grass. Apart from the slimming effect of the grass, it would lower the bond between me and my pixie. I have yet to see items like black pearl or the like have any other effect than on bond, so I guess this may be their use.
