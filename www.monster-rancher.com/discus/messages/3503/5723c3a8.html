 Alright, maybe it&#39;s a game bug, maybe it&#39;s part of the storyline, maybe it&#39;s me, maybe it&#39;s the monsters.  But anyway...MY MONSTERS KEEP FAILING.  CONSTANTLY.  I&#39;m only two months into the game on my save file, but I&#39;ve probably reset enough times to have more than half a year worth of gameplay, and the two monsters I&#39;ve tried so far &#40;an Ogyo/Lagoon and a Raiden/Morx&#41; have had about a 90% failure rate.  Does anyone know what&#39;s happening?  I couldn&#39;t find a reference to this in all the messages I&#39;ve checked on it...

 well i do know that for a fact, when new monsters are used thier failure rate is a bit higher then normal, but once they develope thier trust for you as a trainer and when they have at least over 100 in that skill, the failure rate will start to drop.  Not sure if this helps.

 This is really new territory, and I know that I told Nate this all in Chat, I am simply posting for the benefit of other people who may read it. My Ogyo was like a spoiled princess, and failed a lot too. I think it has to either do with certain breeds or their attributes, or maybe the region that you&#39;re raising them in. The Ogyo improved when she evolved to another sub, and then became an ok monster. Her attributes changed in evolution as well. Species, attribute, or locale; I can&#39;t tell yet. <BR> <BR>Advice? Try feeding a Large Egg, they fix a lot of problems. If that doesn&#39;t help, try evolving it. &#40;Ok, that will take a year, I know it&#39;s not great advice.&#41; It might also have to do with region, but since Nate is just starting out, he doen&#39;t have the luxury of moving the ranch. And, maybe, just maybe, especially when starting out, try raising another main breed.

 Like Lisa mentioned, feeding Large Egg to a monster generally boost it&#39;s nutrition &#40;helpful for evolving monsters if they dont&#39; like the food&#41;. From my experience, better nutritioned monsters do training better.

 Ahem training successes are DIRECTLY related to loyalty and training style.  You want to max loyalty as fast as possible, but keep yer monster healthy also.  If it still fails more than succeeds then verbally brow-beat it.....no more than 2 times in a row in a few months.  For me that style has guaranteed about a 95% training success rate in durahans, golems,dinos,and hengars.  Even when they reached old age they could still train almost 100% successfully and ALWAYS got more than 10 points from 6 months young to point of death.  Health is a key to raising monsters, if yer monster&#39;s favorite food does not have a max health bar then feed it something else that does, and if its loyalty is maxed then only conentrate on its health and dont worry if it gets mad over helthfood unless its train style increases from sheer food alone ie normal-hard from eating healthfood only.

 Once again, observe that I mentioned I was two months into the game when I posted.  I mean, two GAME months.  Therefore, my monsters hadn&#39;t had TIME to gain loyalty, or get disloyalty.  They hadn&#39;t had TIME to really acquire a raising style.  They were just being losers.  The first two I tried to raise, anyway &#40;pure Ogyo and pure Raiden&#41;.  Eventually, I found a Farn that worked much better.  No one has yet satisfactorily explained why the Raiden and Ogyo were such consistant slackers, except that the Ogyo WAS naturally-Spoiled and didn&#39;t match her environment.  No explanation for the Raiden, though.  I know everything you&#39;ve just tried to lecture me on by heart, Anonymous.  And you still haven&#39;t solved the mystery.  Thankfully, it&#39;s now a moot point.

 i know this sounds mean but if you feed or give a scorpion claw everyday from the start, the loyalty goes up quick and is full&#40;100%&#41; in two months in most cases, but of course it will be hardest &#34;policy&#34;. you can always kiss a little but afterwards right?

 Ah, so THAT&#39;S what the Scorpion Claw does!  I was wondering.  And btw, I DON&#39;T like the look Fleria is giving me when I&#39;m training a monster &#34;Hard.&#34;  Is there a &#34;Hardest&#34;?  And if so, are her eyes glowing and snakes swarming from her head at that point?  Because I don&#39;t think she could give a much meaner look than on &#34;Hard.&#34;

 yes there is a &#34;hardest&#34;.  i&#39;ve been there, and she is frown/squinting so hard her eyes almost pop out of her head!
