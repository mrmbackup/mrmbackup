 This question has been on my mind a lot lately: Since the monsters in this game have more similar stat-acquisition than in MR1 and MR2, even between such varied monsters as Pixie and Golem, and the sub-types don&#39;t correspond to any specific monster...do sub-types even matter?  I haven&#39;t raced two of the same basic monster in different type-settings, but those who really love to raise lots of Zan should be especially able to answer.  Does matching the sub-type to the region you&#39;re training in give you better results?  Is a Goat-type Hengar going to get better Intelligence gains than a Takrama-type Hengar?  Or is it all cosmetic &#40;and accessory-equipping&#41; differences, with very little real gameplay effect?

I think there are differences, but they are, as you note, more subtle. Take a look <A HREF="http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/mf3/zukan_index.htm" TARGET="_blank">HERE</A> click a picture, and you will see a letter value next to each attribute of a breed. They are simply using A,B,C,D,E instead or 5,4,3,2,1. However, most breeds have A,B, or C for their pattern -unlike most MR2 breeds where at least one stat per type seemed to always be a 1 or a 2. So, I suspect that it&#39;s just a difference in the patterns, with most types having higher value, closer together patterns.  <BR> <BR>I also noticed a big difference in monsters of a breed gotten from the encyclopedia vs evolving into that type. The evolved monsters &#40;not evolved then taken from the Encyclopedia, evolved on the ranch&#41; seemed to be more like the original breed. I know that I saw differences in food preferences bteween a Zan I evolved into a Goat sub, and the Goat sub I later raised from my encyclopedia entry. So, I think, we need to be careful in noting observations with regards to breed to make sure that we also note if the breed was taken from the book, or evolved on the ranch.

 I lost track of where I had put this discussion earlier, so I&#39;ll move it to here.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve determined of compatibility of races to different climates: <BR> <BR>&#42;Goat monsters work well in Brillia, but the reverse is not true &#40;Brillia types don&#39;t seem to work in Goat&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42;Goat monsters do not work well at all in Takrama. <BR> <BR>&#42;Morx monsters work in Kalaragi, and a little bit in Takrama &#40;I&#39;ll have to do more work&#41;. <BR> <BR>From this, I&#39;m going to make a few guesses on a &#34;compatibility circle.&#34;  Perhaps it&#39;s set up so that each creature type in the circle works in the next region&#39;s area, but going backwards does NOT work, and skipping may yield average or bad results. <BR> <BR>Goat &#62; Brillia &#62; Morx &#62; Kalaragi &#62; Takrama. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if it loops back from Takrama to Goat, and that would certainly be weird and wrong, but hey, I didn&#39;t design the game.  Lisa, while you&#39;re resting monsters, maybe you could check in on this?

 So far, lifespan has not been affected by locale. I have been raising monsters in their native area, and one other area, and it seems to be the same. However, since they are simply resting, they cannot fail at it. The only weird thing to happen so far was that my Pancho &#40;Pancho/Kalaragi&#41; would sometimes reject its food and demand another type of food.

 What is the purpose of evolving a monster? What does it change? I keep reading about evolving your monster, but you have never given a reason why you should do it. This may be a stupid question but I&#39;m fairly new to the game, and I would appreciate it if someone could tell me. <BR> <BR>                      Thanks!

 It can help them outgrow some unfavorable characteristics, change their strengths &amp; weaknesses a bit, and gives you a different looking monster. Like the other MR games, the various sub-breeds have similarities and differences with other monsters of the same main type.

<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
It slightly changes how they acquire stats, and as noted above, different monsters do better in different environments &#40;and since different environments have different drills, this is an issue&#41;.  Also, once you get a monster in your Encyclopedia through evolution, you can resurrect it at the shrine without ever having gotten a disk stone for it.
