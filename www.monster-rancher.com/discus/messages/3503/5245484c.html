 Please note, what I am about to discuss has nothing to do with evolution or the localizing of monsters. <BR> <BR>In the Japanese game I found three pairs of CDs that made rare monsters. I only ran about 100 CD discs &amp; 50 games through the shrine. At first I thought it was really wierd to have been so lucky as to get doubles of so many rares. Then I looked at the stats. In each case, the stats were different for each CD. So, while I had two frogs, two piggies, and two lavendar-dracula suzurins, each had unique characteristics and stats. Plus, the suzurins were odd; one was from a Dreamcast game, one from a music CD. &#40;Yes, in MR2 a few CDs have been found to make rares that also make rares from agame discs &amp; vice versa. However, we have good evidence that this fact is us simply finding discs that match the Japanese rares, which were left coded in the game in addition to the US rares.&#41; <BR> <BR>Then, I decided to try an experiment. I looked up those 6 CDs in the CD lists for MR1, MR2 and BC ep2. I took all the CDs I owned that made the same monsters as those 6 in the other 3 games, and shrined them. Now, previously when trying music CDs &#40;grabbed by artist, for no particular reason except to say &#34;I tried all the Ramones&#34;&#41; I had found a rare in about 1 in every 25 CDs. When I shrined the CDs that I pulled for being similar to ones I knew made rares, one in 4 made a rare! Now, none of them turned out to make more of the rares I already had found. They were a variety of types. -But still, I suddenly had a lot of rares. <BR> <BR>My conclusion, I believe that in MR3 the shrine treats &#39;?&#39; subs as simply another sub-breed; found randomly on discs. Yes, there appear to be a few hard-coded rares from particular discs, like the ones that US fans suggested, and they may be exempt from this pattern. Also, this worked in the Japanese version, and may not be true in the US game. I simply ask that you wait and see, and please write down the stats and techs for all the monster you shrine so we can compare.

 Actually, in a way, this makes some sense... since &#40;if I&#39;m right in understanding how MR3 works&#41; there are no longer any &#34;subbreeds&#34; per se, just the &#34;subtypes&#34; of the main breeds varying by location. So that gives each type of monster with five variations depending on location, no more, no less, and to add any variety or anything special, you need a different type of subtype completely outside this. <BR> <BR>I could of course be wrong, just speculating. ;&#41;
