 My Zan is not greatly impressing me.  If I&#39;d known that it would have this &#34;All signs point to me not giving a rat&#39;s @$$&#34; attitude, I would have named it Squall instead of Jedah.  I went through the process of turning it from a pure Zan into a Retsu, which seems to have resulted in a shorter lifespan and a &#34;Harder&#34; training style that I can&#39;t seem to shake, because this thing doesn&#39;t care for any of the food I give it.  It really does have only a 1 or 2 for &#34;Favorite&#34; in all foods.  I originally thought it was because of the &#34;Calm&#34; characteristic, but now that it&#39;s evolved it&#39;s lost it, and it continues to be a punk.  It failed constantly in its early days, it gets tired easily even when raised in its own environment, and what&#39;s more, Retsu apparently have Tough Skin.  This does not work particularly well with a speed demon.  I gave it the heart of my champion Usazo, Ravage &#40;It was like a messed-up version of the Monty Python and the Holy Grail killer rabbit!  It rocked!&#41;, and its realiability seems to have improved since, but I&#39;m still unable to shake this &#34;Harder&#34; treatment that seems to be slowly killing it.  Any calls?

 having never raised a zan, i can only give general advice which may or may not help: <BR> <BR>1&#93;  give a large egg.  just on general principles. <BR> <BR>2&#93;  try switching to one of the softer responses &#91;great job for great/ even a no big deal for failures&#93;  to try to get it down to normal. <BR> <BR>3&#93;  try switching areas, and watching for subtle hints on the animations that it likes that area better. <BR> <BR>4&#93;  just go ahead, raise its stats, to hell with its pleasure and lifespan, grab the heart and chalk it up to experience. <BR> <BR>well, that does it for my bag of tricks, pitiful as it may be...

 I&#39;ve determined that Large Eggs only work on physical problems, as well they should.  Mental problems &#40;Vegetarian, Pride, Eats Anything, etc.&#41; don&#39;t vaporize with the Egg.

 Out of curiosity Nate, it doesn&#39;t have the &#34;eats anything&#34; characteristic, does it? That&#39;d cause all the foods to be around two on &#34;favorite.&#34; &#40;Eats anything is an especial pain combined with &#34;vegetarian&#34; by the way... &#42;sigh&#42;&#41; <BR> <BR>As for getting the training style down from harder... I wouldn&#39;t worry THAT much about it &#40;remember that there&#39;s a mistranslation, and &#34;harder&#34; is easier on it than &#34;hard&#34;&#41;.. but if you really want to lose it, try seeing what it likes. I&#39;d suggest trying a black pearl, or maybe coral. Then give that to it every so often, just as a reward, or a gift, or what have you. That should help smooth things over for you.
