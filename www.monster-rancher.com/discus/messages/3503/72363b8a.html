 I&#39;m trying to figure out how many battles fought/won it takes to raise skill sense.  Tell how many fights and wins your monster has and its skill sense.  Only if its skill sense is less than A.  Keep track of trainer battles on the ranch or on ventures but tell those numbers separate.  Make sure you have the lowest number of wins or battles before you post it. <BR>Thanks

 Trying to see if rank matters would take a little more time.  If there doesnt seem like there is a definite pattern that would be worth looking into.

 Try keeping track of your KO&#39;s. I just had Sense go up between ranks and the only difference was I was getting KO&#39;s. Rank, so far, doesn&#39;t affect Sense. Had an Ogyo go it&#39;s whole life to S rank with an E Sense.

It appears there is a weighting applied so that KO&#39;s count more than just Wins and Losses may actually reduce Sense within a Level. <BR> <BR>The Sense ranks appear to be three-part. Like so: <BR> <BR>E- Hibernation - 5-8 points per hall <BR>E2 - 30 - 35 points &#40;this seems to be the base amount&#41; <BR>E1 - 35 - 40 points and so on. <BR> <BR>They appear to be based on how well you do in <B>all</B> battles &#40;rival battles included&#41;. It takes approximately 5 KO&#39;s per Level for an increase. This means that at the moment I have a B Class monster with a B sense rating.  <BR> <BR>The reason I am assuming sub-levels in Sense is that I have lost the occasional rival battle and had a monster that was making 45-50 at the Halls drop back to making 40 and 41 the next season. Win a battle and I have actually had Sense increase to the next Level. <BR> <BR>So, for those of us who tend to avoid battles except to advance, we are hurting ourselves on acquiring Skill levels. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have any real numbers yet &#40;too many variables&#41;, but I am working on it. If my brain doesn&#39;t fry on maxxing techs, I&#39;ll report more later.

 I wouldn&#39;t say that. The more I work with it the more complex it gets. <BR> <BR>Now, it seems that KOs are the only determinant for raising a Sense level. You can&#39;t have a Sense higher than your current Rank. Wins seem to increase the points you get in Noisy Halls. Losses seem to decrease points gained. And Rival battle Wins count as much as KOs &#40;maybe&#41;. <BR> <BR>Lots left to do. The post above was just a broad outline of Sense as it connects to Noisy Halls. And all of this is subject to change with more, i.e. better, data.

Well, like I said, things can change. <BR> <BR>The separate levels inside the Sense ratings have now disappeared. Have a Hare jumping from top points to bottom points and back again in the same venture. <BR> <BR>You <B>CAN</B> have a Sense rating higher then your monster&#39;s Rank. Brought same Hare to a C Sense while it was in D class. <BR> <BR>KO&#39;s are still the only for-sure way to raise your Sense rank. Rival battles are still being tested, data inconclusive. <BR> <BR>Feel free to jump in and check my findings. The more, the merrier.

 When i was raising Panthy to get the tech stats, it did horrible and only KO&#39;ed 4 opponents, and the sense was still at E. After it won a tourney with 6 opponents it went up to D, however it didn&#39;t KO any of the opponents. I think that there might be a point system that where say a win might be worth 1 pt and a KO might be worth 2 or 3 points. And each rank might require a certain number of points. &#40;the value of the points are just examples, im not saying those are the actual values&#41;. <BR> <BR>Another thing with surprised me, it that i eventuall got panthy&#39;s sense up to C, but after a while without fighting, it misteriously went back down to D. I don&#39;t know if this could have to do with a monster getting to much sleep, or if it was just a coinsidence or a glitch. I don&#39;t know, but it never happened &#40;as far as i noticed&#41; with any of my other monsters.

 here is my sense experience.  my jell, luka, is being raised solely to have a forte in an aurora bit tech, jell charge.  he uses only jell charge. he had reached b level, but still only had an E in battle sense.  then, in one month, he ko&#39;d an enemy monster during a venture in brillia, without changing his sense level.  later that month, he went to the b official tourney, and no one withdrew, and using only jell charge, he ko&#39;d them all!  after the battle, his sense level had indeed risen to d. <BR> <BR>i wanted to make sure that, even if you only use one tech, the battle sense rises across the board...and indeed it had.  i also wanted to see if you ever &#34;caught up&#34; once your sense level and your rank differed - and, despite the best possible result, he gained only one level.

 The thing is, tigerbubble, that wins against Rivals count like KO&#39;s &#40;or nearly so&#41;. So, if you fought a Rival&#39;s monster in that tournament &#40;a given for me anymore 1-3 times&#41;, you got the points you needed from them even without KO&#39;ing them.

 A little bit of casual data from my just-finished Momo.  It battled early on in life.  So early in fact that it lost a match with Fleria and her cheating Shark, at 3 months of age.  Anyways, I battled in an elimination tourney a few months later, and K.O.&#39;ed 1 of the 2 opponents.  Afterwards, I entered the E class tournament, and K.O.&#39;ed 3 of the 5 opponents offered.  That put me at 4, and then I beat the tar out of Rip and Rap, which would have placed me at 5. <BR> <BR>My &#34;Sense&#34; ranking didn&#39;t elevate to &#34;D,&#34; though.  In fact, even after yet another rival battle &#40;against Date&#41;, I was only an &#34;E&#34;.  If the number of wins/K.O.&#39;s determines sense, then it must be at LEAST 10 K.O.&#39;s to get to &#34;D Sense.&#34; <BR> <BR>When I entered the &#34;D Class&#34; official the following season, my monster K.O.&#39;ed another 3 of the 5 offered, and only then was it considered a &#34;D Sense.&#34;  Another additive is that D must be worth considerably more points, as the battle sense did not recede to its&#39; previous rank, like most of my monsters end up doing. <BR> <BR>1 loss to Gadamon <BR>1K.O/ 1win Elimination <BR>3 K.O./ 2wins at E Official <BR>1 win to Rip&amp;Rap <BR>1 win to Date <BR>3K.O/ 2wins at D Official <BR> <BR>That&#39;s 7 K.O.&#39;s, 7 wins, and 1 loss.  In short, I estimate the K.O. ratio closer to 10 E&#39;s and maybe 15 D&#39;s for &#34;C Sense&#34;.  I know that I usually climb straight up the ladder, and wind-up fighting the G-5 with a &#34;C&#34; battle sense.

 I&#39;d like to know how your Sense goes down. That&#39;s something I&#39;ve never managed to do. Once it goes up, it stays up. Do you &#39;slum&#39; a lot? I&#39;ve never fought in tournaments below my current Rank, so that might be the difference. <BR> <BR>Again, all I can say is that I&#39;ve tracked this across a lot of monsters. Five KOs per Sense level is all I&#39;ve ever needed to change the rank. <BR> <BR>Keep collecting data on your next few monsters. I&#39;d like to see and compare it to mine.

 About 1/3 of my monsters have had their &#34;Sense&#34; ranking decrease after using it in a &#34;Noisy Hall&#34; venture.  However, these monsters usually fight Officials only, as is my regiment for training.  I&#39;ve found that beating D Official brings your Sense up to &#34;D,&#34; but if you continue fighting only Officials, your monster won&#39;t get &#34;C Sense&#34; until rank A, or sometimes S. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll keep a record of ratio Wins-K.O.s for my next couple of monsters and report my findings.  Might I ask what tournaments you normally battle, how often, and what your ratios are for a non-money-making monster?

 Good question. My style varies all the time depending on the monster and its techs. Ogyos don&#39;t fight until late on, say a year and a half for their first tourney. Mostly, it&#39;s one unofficial and then the Official per level. Unless they hang up in B where they might fight up to three times before going Official.

 After extensive work in this project, and three simulataneously raised saves, I&#39;m just as stumped as ever -_- <BR> <BR>My Garuda earned a &#34;D Sense&#34; before ever completing &#34;E&#34; class. <BR> <BR>My Dragon earned a &#34;D Sense&#34; only after completing the rank &#34;C&#34; Official. <BR> <BR>My Kuririn, on the other hand, made &#34;D Sense&#34; directly after completing &#34;E&#34; class. <BR> <BR>Facts: <BR> <BR>-My Garuda was a money-maker.  It was always in any tourament on the map.  It almost always won by K.O., and fought any and all rival matches.  Needless to say, it had the lifespan sub-par to a Naga, but that&#39;s unimportant in this case. <BR> <BR>-My Dragon was raised as a sort of limit test of point distribution.  It was always placed in a battle it barely had enough stats to win.  Thus, no monster was ever K.O.&#39;ed by this monster until its dying days. <BR> <BR>-My Kuririn was raised as I normally raise my monsters; overdkill in stat parameters so one hit could take out the opponent effortlessly.  Unlike my normal routine, however, I&#39;d always place him in a fight as soon as possible when its &#34;Sense&#34; ranking would increase. <BR> <BR>Hypothesis: <BR> <BR>-K.O.&#39;s are worth significantly more than standardized winnings.  I suspect as much as a 1-4 point ratio. <BR> <BR>-Unlike I had previously theorized, stat levels play little, and probably no, part in determining the &#34;Sense&#34; ranking.  If they had, my Dragon, while far less K.O.&#39;s, would have had the quickest raising &#34;Sense&#34;. <BR> <BR>-As far as I can tell, age plays no significant part in determining sense ranking. <BR> <BR>-Higher ranking tournaments are UDOUBTEDLY worth more points, and greatly-so, at that.  I estimate a table such as follows: <BR> <BR>E - 1-4 possible per battle, 20pts. to next class <BR>D - 4-8 possible per battle, 80pts. to next class <BR>C - 16-24 possible per battle, 160pts. to next class <BR>B - 40-64 possible per battle, 240pts. to next class <BR>A - As far as I can tell, this is the MAX &#34;Sense&#34; <BR> <BR>Disclaimer:  Please note that this is all specultion based on progressive matehmatical hypothesis, and may or may not be true, valid, or even close.  Much more testing will need to be done on this system to discover any truth to the aforementioned statements. <BR> <BR>On a side-note, to ensure that &#34;Sense&#34; does note retrogress after a venture, enter in any tourney, equal to your monster&#39;s current class, after your &#34;Sense&#34; ranking has increased.  This should almost always provide adequate point adjustment to hold the ranking stable.
