<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
The techs occupy the following places in the monster&#39;s tech chart in page 3 of &#34;View Mode&#34; in the game: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Bit</TD><TD>Bit</TD><TD>Stone</TD><TD>Stone</TD><TD>Orb</TD><TD>Orb </TD></TR><TR><TD>Bit</TD><TD>Bit</TD><TD>Stone</TD><TD>Stone</TD><TD>Orb</TD><TD>Orb</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Each tech can be improved by levelling it up on expeditions at the spots with a &#34;Noisy Hall&#34;. Each expedition has 3 of these spots. <BR> <BR>When you &#39;unlock&#39; a tech for your monster &#40;use a bit, stone, or orb&#41; this tech will forever after appear on the &#39;moves&#39; screen of that monster type &#40;Moves other than those you have ulocked previously are blank&#41;.  <BR> <BR>There are essentially 2 types of techs, Intelligence based techs with green icons, and Power based techs with yellow icons. Most of these are attacks assigned a type &#40;Cut,Magic,Pound,Beat&#41; however a few have special properties such as restoring life or altering a monster&#39;s range in battle, and may not be used for attacking at all. Check our Tech charts for details. <BR> <BR>You can view techs in the grid in view mode &#40;Press the square button and select &#34;Monster&#34;.&#41;. However, appearing on the grid does not mean you can assign them to your controller. Only the techs in page 2 of view mode are considered &#34;learned&#34; by your monsters. To add a tech to the list of 4 or less in the &#34;learned section&#34;, a monster will have to learn or re-learn that tech by going through the aqusition process. <BR> <BR>Techs are aquired by getting a special item, either a bit, stone or orb, then taking that item to a &#34;Lord&#34; in an expedition area. If you don&#39;t already have the tech associated with that item, your monster will learn the new tech. <BR> <BR>The &#34;Lords&#34; are: <BR>Morx: giant groundhog <BR>Takrama: two headed serpent <BR>Brillia: Jill <BR>Kalaragi: green Ape <BR>Goat: giant seahorse <BR> <BR>Each item, bit, stone, orb is aquired differently. <BR> <BR><B>Bit:</B> found on expedition  <BR><B>Stone:</B> won in the free-for-all battles at the bottom of the tourney chart <BR><B>Orb:</B> won by KOing high ranking opponents on expedition <BR> <BR>There are 4 types of each item, Flare, Aqua, Aurora and Jade. Each has a unique color. How many of each you aquire depends on breed. Some breeds simply do not have techs based on particular orbs, therefore those orbs will always be useless to them. <BR>Flare: red <BR>Aqua: blue <BR>Aurora: white <BR>Jade: green <BR> <BR>The bits, being easiest to obtain, give what are essentially basic techs. These techs ares servicable at low levels of battle, but eventually you will find they aren&#39;t as useful as ones from stones and orbs. Check the techs charts for examples. Bits can be obtained on ventures in any area. <BR> <BR>Orbs are gotten after KOing opponents in some battles on ventures, these occur at the &#34;bad feeling&#34; spots -however, when an opponent who can give an orb appears Fleria will NOT have a &#34;bad feeling&#34; at the spot. The opponent monster is always of a breed not native to the locale you are in at the time. The chance of encountering a monster that will award you an orb seems to increase as the monster&#39;s rank and stats increase. The lowest rank on record for finding an Orb is C.  <BR>Orbs of all sorts can be gotten in Morx. <BR>The rest are: <BR>Goat = Aqua Orb <BR>Takrama = Flare Orb <BR>Kalaragi = Jade Orb <BR>Brillia = Aurora Orb <BR> <BR>These are all locations seen for &#34;bad feeling&#34; spots. I&#39;ve encountered monsters from the same locations and they almost always &#40;can&#39;t say I&#39;m ABSOLUTELY sure&#41; seem to drop orbs even when you don&#39;t KO them, as long as you win.  <BR> <BR>Goat:  <BR>1. The big Octopus head  <BR>2. The left side of the giant seashell.  <BR>3. The right side of the long shell.  <BR> <BR>Brillia:  <BR>1. The top of the hill &#40;where one of the hidden drills are&#41;  <BR>2. The right tree at the bottom of the hill &#40;opposite side of the noisy hall&#41;  <BR>3. The top tree next to the spot that let&#39;s you jumpGoat:  <BR> <BR>Takrama:  <BR>1. The funky 2 rocks next to the antlion pit/noisy hall location  <BR>2. There is a big rock on the left side of Takrama with 2 little rocks on the left of it, search one of those.  <BR>3. The small opening in between the wall and the stone staircase &#40;northeast when you push r1&#41;  <BR> <BR>Kalaragi:  <BR>1. The waterfall, on the left ramp, where you can see bats.  <BR>2. Go to the right, and get off the lily pads and onto land. It&#39;s in front of the plant nearest to the lily pad. <BR>3. Go to the left lily pad and search the single rock near the front, very close yo the main lily pad.  <BR> <BR>Morx:  <BR>1. Left row of mushrooms from where you start.  <BR>2. When you go pass the tree, in the back are 2 mushrooms.  <BR>3. Climb up the tree &#40;the right side of r1&#41; and search the branch &#40;has a squirrel at the bottom of the screen&#41;. <BR>  <BR><FONT SIZE="-2"><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Thanks to Ray Gamer, Nate Railsback, Deior</FONT></FONT>
