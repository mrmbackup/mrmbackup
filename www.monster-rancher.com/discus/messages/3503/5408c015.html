 Just to check: How EXACTLY do these items help you?  I mean, do the Goblets only activate when you Rest?  Because if so, they&#39;re a rip-off.  My monsters already get back to full energy from one Rest, and I wouldn&#39;t want to push them any further because that would make them lose lifespan?  Also, is this a misperception, or do both the Rocks and the Pot/Incense decrease stress?

 Presumably, the goblets and rocks reduce the accumulation of fatigue and stress, respectively. The pots increase the reduction of stress and fatigue when the monster rests.

 i now have the most expensive durables of all types.  my monsters are now doing better than ever.  the specific things i notice are: 1&#93; more greats, and fewer failures; 2&#93; occasional months where the monster stays at healthy for an extra week, before dropping to looks healthy. <BR> <BR>of course, i am also feeding a better diet - more balanced, while still nutritious.  i also am more cognizant of where monsters want to be raised, and the differences between animations and results, so i say the right thing to them more often. <BR> <BR>i fear that the acumulation of all these small advantages lead to maximizing the invisible governor of your monster&#39;s ability in drills and battles, willpower.  all the game characters talk about it, but, like the wind, it is only seen through its effects.

 Being a possessor of the said &#34;Holy Goblet,&#34; I personally think that it&#39;s worth the money.  However, I saved-up and got it first, so having the lesser cups may make it seem mundane.  Compared to nothing, I get about 1.5 extra weeks of training from it &#40;assuming you only do light drills&#41;.  For hard drilling a monster, it&#39;s pretty much a must.

 So the holy goblet... it lowers tiredness every week, even when drilling? If so i&#39;ll be all set, my 3rd monster beat ragnarox and i already have 95,000g.But wouldn&#39;t having the goblet not allow you to get bits,stones,and orbs?

 I used to think the same thing. You see, there is only one durable item slot availible to tech items. Now, if you fill that with another durable, wouldn&#39;t it seem like that slot would be taken up? It makes more sense to me w/o words than it does, but I understand his thinking.

 no, if you buy ,for say..a holy goblet...you can still hold one skill item besides the goblet. i bought the holy goblet....i haven&#39;t really noticed any recovery of tiredness...it&#39;s just like normal..so far...but, i did notice that my Icicle&#40;Beaklon/brillia&#41; gains guts extremely fast, i was facing a purebreed pixie and the guts went up evenly...

 you hold the holy goblet, the shining rock, the aroma pot, the medicine kit and one skill item.  even if you don&#39;t have the others, you are still limited to one skill item tho.

 That&#39;s a good question for Richard Riley.  He&#39;s been testing that part of the save to see the value of rest and the after on the life left number based on the stress and fatigue numbers.  I&#39;ve seen little to no difference in the items, but Richard and I saw differences in life lost from resting &#40;gonna have to post the research here too when it&#39;s done.&#41;  But we know where the stress/fatigue/starting life/life left amounts are in the save and could easily test if the goblets and pots make a difference and how much.  I&#39;ll ask in the other thread.

 can you hold all three stones and goblets, herbal incense, and aroma pot? <BR>if yes, then together wouldnt they decrease fatigue and stress a lot more? <BR>probably not though .. poop ..

 No, each stone and goblet replaces its predecessor. And the incense is replaced by the pot.

 First off I want to congratulate everyone who posts fervently here and the people who do all this research. It&#39;s by far the best site I have ever seen on any Monster Rancer game.  <BR> <BR>I wish I could contribute in the mathmatical calculations of lifespans and the effects of battles, accesories, etc., on performance throughout the game, but I&#39;m not a mathmaticlly sound person. I could, however, do research on lifespans of certain monsters. Unfortunately, I was unable to play MR2, but I was a sound MR veteran, capable or popping off 23 on skill trainings for my infamous Hengers; only to find that monsters in this third installment only live three years on the average as opposed to my fourteen year old creatures from the original Monster Rancher.  <BR> <BR>The main reason for this, I am sure, is they didn&#39;t want it too easy to make a powerful monster and storm through the game, defeat the great five and the battle after that by year four. Also, you don&#39;t have to train Skill anymore, which is probably another reason they deducted from the monsters life. One less section to train for. <BR>Also, instead of working ; you can train pretty much the same you you paid 2K to do in the original Monster Rancher. I&#39;m sure there are many more factors incorporated into this formula, or perhaps less. <BR> <BR>After many memories, I come to my question. I&#39;ve skimmed most of the topics and not seen anything on this topic, but perhaps that&#39;s my bad eyesight.  <BR> <BR>There are stones and Goblets, which are supposed to do things for your monster. The exspensive ones, as you know, cost an insane amount of cash. I have nowhere enough cash for those items yet, because I really don&#39;t battle much, just train my monsters a whole lot.  <BR> <BR>Do I want to battle, spend the 125,000$$ for a little tin cup with plastic wings on it <BR>to make my monster a bit more happy? Will it in fact have any effect? I&#39;m really picky spending my money, not that I spend it on anything else; considering there&#39;s not much to do with it, but I also don&#39;t want to have a useless item. <BR> <BR>I could see this going two ways. The less exspensive items are a waste of time and probably wont do anything for your monster except give it something to cuddle when it sleeps, &#40;hurray, toy rock&#41; ; but the exspensive items actually do work to some degree. Or they could all just be eye teasers. That was the feel I got from Monster Rancher1, because I found those nifty items on adventures and they seemed to never do a thing for my monsters.  <BR> <BR>So, are the items here in Monster Rancher 3 worth spending my precious &#40;yeah right&#41; dollars on? Or are they just more eye candy to keep us preoccupied from our real goal as breeders?  <BR>&#40; which i have yet to discover .. &#41; <BR> <BR>I just read a bit on this thread, and I know these have already been asked. I am willing to test this over and over with every monster &#40;save joker, in which I can&#39;t find a CD for.&#41;if anybody wishes to see my results.  <BR>I will porbably start with a Henger &#40;because they like vine grass full nut. and fav.&#41; that way I&#39;ll be sure food wont effect the calculations, only a little if at all. Then I could move to different monsters, raising it until it passes then loading the same save, repeating the same things over and over, &#40;probably continious rest&#41; and compare with several other test subjects. Boy, this stuff gets technical. <BR>On another note, some items are probably going to only show their use, if in fact they have one, IF you train fervently with your monsters. Two seperate saves, one with and one without the items, training a month straight perhaps will give different conclusions of stress and how tired they become. So many ideas .. <BR>Thanks for your time. If anybody wishes to see the results, I&#39;ll post them and keep updates if it&#39;s not too much of a bother. <BR> <BR>                               - Lifebreak

 Don&#39;t make fun of those goblets! It&#39;s real gold with silver wings. And the diamonds are real, too! Or at least in the game... I haven&#39;t played in a while. People say that they see changes with this. It&#39;s a very good item to have when you&#39;re doing hard drills. You can get about 1 more light drill before resting if you&#39;re only doing light drills. For some people, it doesn&#39;t help much, but having all the other expensive items, it does. <BR> So my choice is: Wait for some other opinions!

 to my knowledge, no one has done control study testing on the effect of the durable items.  it would be great if you wanted to do it, and kept organized results. <BR> <BR>my experience is practical.  once i started raising a string of monsters, i started getting more money than there was anything reasonable in the game to do with it.  so i bought the little cups and stones, and eventually traded up to the big guys.  i really didnt do anything organized to keep track of whether they were helping me or not.  it seems my monsters turned out better, but then again, it could have just been my improvement as a trainer.

 I wasn&#39;t poking fun, merely .. describing the merchandise? Hey, if they can kick my monster into another week of training I&#39;m all for it, but until some solid, consistant reports come in &#40;which i am working on, trust me - i DO hope they work&#41; they&#39;re still just plastic and tin-foil. :&#41; <BR> <BR>I got my PS2 back tonight, after parting with it for a day as part of a deal to full access to my friend&#39;s massive CD archive, so I might start research tonight; or wait for some advice from people who know &#40;lots&#41; a little more then me. :x <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got to work on guidelines to test if the items effect lifespan, then another set for training. Sometimes, after culumitive hours of gaming, our minds and eyes will play tricks on us, making you think you&#39;re getting extra out of your item when in fact you rested the week prior! <BR>&#40;Yes, the PS2 is out to get me&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway. Off to game. Good stuff. <BR> <BR>Lifebreak-

 On a quick side note: <BR> <BR>I just finished preparing some traits and stats transfers with an awesome heart. First generation was a Suezo, who I maxed in power then raised some Def. and Lif.  <BR>Second generation was a Cantalos &#91;Beaklon/?&#93; who lived a suprisingly long time for me. I maxed Pow, Def., and some Spd. and Lif.  <BR>Right now I&#39;m on my money maker. A Brilla Zan, the cool looking black ones. I just gave him the monster heart and he ended up with these powerhouse characteristics :  <BR>1. Tough Skin &#91; Oh yeah. &#93; <BR>2. Sweet Smell &#91; Pretty sure it lowers opponets acc.&#93; <BR>3. Sharp Eyes &#91; We all know what this does. &#93; <BR>Can you say ouch?  <BR>His power is 350 to start, with speed 300 I believe. Def is 280, all stats otherwise above 200. He&#39;s the one who going to earn me enough &#91;G&#93; to buy these killer items I&#39;m going to test. <BR>As for now, I&#39;m going to battle like insane and TRYTRYTRY to get an ORB. I&#39;ve only gotten one, ever. <BR>I&#39;m posting Guidelines next. <BR> <BR>Lifebreak-

 Yep, and G stands for gold. Someone once said geli or something like that, but in MRA in a storyline there is an offer of 20,000G for beating a monster, and, since the ranchers are poor, they say something like, &#34;Oh calm down, it&#39;s only twenty thou.... twenty thousand gold???....&#34; SO THERE! I have proof. HahAHAHahaHA
