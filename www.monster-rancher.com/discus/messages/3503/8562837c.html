<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:monster_rancher_metropolis@hotmail.com>Lisa Shock</A></B> on <B>Sunday, August 18, 2002 - 06:28 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
I started out to test the effects of no food on lifespan, and thus raised a monster by resting it for its entire life, and feeding nothing. No freezing, no trips, nothing. I used a Naga, and raised it in Kalaragi.  <BR> <BR>Now, I pulled it from my encyclopedia. I <I>think</I> it&#39;s the same entry I used for doing my other lifepan research. -Since I usually don&#39;t save after shrining unless I find a really cool characteristic, and my current Naga doesn&#39;t have anything special. &#40;no Iron Heart, no Strong Heart&#41; But, with all honesty I have to admit that I can&#39;t guarantee that it&#39;s the same monster. <BR> <BR>At any rate, I used Naga, because that was the first lifespan monster I ever tested. When I did my original research, I tested it in every local, with 5 different foods, with assorted foods, etc. And, Crystal Pixie tested it &#40;the breed, from her save with her monster of the same type, not identical stats&#41; too. Every time we got 4y2m2w.  <BR> <BR>This time, I got 4y3m2w. A whole month MORE life. Now I have always wondered why some of Richard Ryley&#39;s hacked lifespans varied from mine by a week or two, in his charts at monster-rancher.com. Especially since his Naga is off from mine by one week, and like I said, Naga has been the most thoroughly tested breed ever. <BR> <BR>Something is clearly up. I don&#39;t know what, and it doesn&#39;t seem to affect monsters for really great lengths of lifespan, but it&#39;s there. This may also color other research like the theory that various breeds do better in various places.

 Lisa, that&#39;s interesting because if you remember when Richard and I first looked at where lifespan was in the save, he came up with 10 points lost for resting and I saw 9....I didn&#39;t do it over and over though.  Just did it once and observed.

 Oh I did forget to mention one other possible variable; in MR2 monsters off CDs have the possibility of additional lifespan, but ones made by combining have fixed lifespans. So, maybe, lifespans gotten by different sorts of entries in the Encyclopedia vary a little. &#40;We haven&#39;t found any real purpose for the game telling you with that little icon about where your monster came from: CD, evolved, copied from another book.&#41; <BR> <BR>As for the 10 vs 9 issue, that could be several things. Possibly a setting off CD, or perhaps some sort of interaction between a breed and a particular locale, or maybe it has to do with foods or characteristics. <BR> <BR>At any rate, it is tantalizing to researchers, and will undoubtedly be the subject of more study, but I still seriously doubt anyone&#39;s claims of 8 year lifespans in this game.
