<FONT COLOR="0000ff">The Cast of Characters</FONT> <BR> <BR><B>Shrine/Etc.:</B> <BR> <BR>&#34;Grandpa&#34; Bragma - Runs the shrine that allows you to regenerate monsters. Also acts as a mentor. <BR> <BR>Mucchi - Wanders throughout the regions to sell and buy items, also sells the ran ran items at venturing time. <BR> <BR><B>Morx</B> <BR> <BR>Gadamon - Fleria&#39;s main rival. A mean-tempered, vain young female trainer. Always causing trouble, mostly for Fleria, but for others as well. <BR> <BR>Mitia - Another young female trainer around Gadamon&#39;s and Fleria&#39;s age, much kinder and gentler. Considers you a worthy opponent to match her skills against. <BR> <BR>&#34;Grandma&#34; Mosha - An elderly female native of Morx and longtime trainer. Knows many things, and has a past with Bragma. <BR> <BR>Taz - Mosha&#39;s nephew, a boy that loves to train Beaklons, which can cause him to stir up trouble. <BR> <BR>Yuikyo - A new female breeder who is looking for a place to train monsters and gain experience. Very quiet, and not very confident. <BR> <BR><B>Takrama</B> <BR> <BR>Haz - A young male breeder, very serious about his work.  <BR> <BR>Shimuka - An impetuous young male breeder, but good-hearted, if too impulsive. Pursuing a bad monster trainer in the area. <BR> <BR>&#34;Master/Grandpa&#34; Lus - An elderly male trainer and Haz&#39;s teacher. Fairly quiet and serious, and calm. <BR> <BR><B>Kalaragi</B> <BR> <BR>Lek - A young male breeder. Fairly carefree, knows the area fairly well. <BR> <BR>Sansha - A female breeder, but cares more for fishing than for training it seems. Pretty laid-back. <BR> <BR>Jimsey - A younger male trainer. Loves money too much, to the point of thievery. <BR> <BR><B>Brillia</B> <BR> <BR>Maya - A young female breeder who is lonely in the cold area. Her family owns the land that you and Fleria use to train in this locale. <BR> <BR>Taya - Maya&#39;s young brother. Very shy at first, somewhat less so as he gets to know you. <BR> <BR>Nahze - A trainer that modifies monsters through creating and altering accessories. A bit naive in other matters. Owns a strange monster that he discovered called a Zan... <BR> <BR><B>Goat</B> <BR> <BR>&#34;Lord&#34; Burn - A somewhat arrogant, hot-headed young male trainer, although after the first impressions he turns out to be a decent guy. <BR> <BR>Ms. Jenna - A well-known female breeder, has acted as a mentor toward Fleria. She likes to battle, but is still good-tempered and fairly easygoing. <BR> <BR>Kai - A shady male trainer that brings trouble with him. He claims to know something about the mysterious Joker monster... <BR> <BR>Date - A somewhat young male breeder who is rich and arrogant. He doesn&#39;t seem to be intentionally rude, he just doesn&#39;t realize how his attitude rubs others. He seems to think many problems can be solved most easily with money. <BR> <BR>Rip and Rap - A pair of little sisters who used to live near Fleria, and who can really hold a grudge when it comes to food. <BR> <BR>Dagga - A mysterious man that can be summoned when the time and conditions are right, along with his powerful monster... <BR>
