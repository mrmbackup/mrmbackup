 Okay, I looked and this does not seem to b covered unless I really am blind. I&#39;ve heard about Area Stats, like Brillia-Speed, Morx-Int, etc.  <BR> <BR>But I dont know anythign about them and sence the subject isn&#39;t covered... :&#92; What does this mean?

 Hmm...can you elaborate? I&#39;m just not quite understanding the question....Is this in reference to statgains in areas, or how certain subs are affected?

 I&#39;m not really sure, becasue all I know is that Areas are said to have &#39;best stats&#39;. I supose how certain subs are affected would answer that, but as I said, I&#39;m just confused at to waht it means and I havent been able to find any info on it. :&#92;

 I am not certain anyone has looked into it in detail. Each area has such different drills, that right now, I tend to chose simply based upon the stats I am interested in raising, and the ones I don&#39;t mind going down. I have noticed that some subs seem to find food they like better or is more nutritous in some areas, but I have not noticed a trend towards breeds doing better stat wise in drills by area. There are so many variables! I will keep it in mind, though.

 generally speaking, we are kind of a volunteer organization here.  we do not have a &#34;crack team of researchers&#34; on staff here; pretty much people do what interests them.  so what is interesting me now is trying to make the tech charts complete, and trying to follow up on dig mosh mogi&#39;s 4th week method, and, in my own game, i am finally getting around to unlocking joker. <BR> <BR>someone may well get interested in doing what you suggest; but someone may not either.  the only sure thing is if someone does it, and posts the results, we will thank them.

 I have not noticed any particular area increasing a particular stat.  Only the combination of monster and area benefiting a stat &#40;ex:  Marsala in Takrama training Defense&#41;. <BR> <BR>One interesting note, and this may have been covered elsewhere, is to change areas to train up one stat and drop another. <BR> <BR>For example, in Takrama, Rock Push raises Power but drops Intelligence.  In Kalaragi, Dive raises Defense but drops Intelligence. <BR> <BR>So, for my Marsala, whom Intelligence is not that important ATM, I can use those two areas to raise two of his best stats while lowering one I find insignificant.  Now, this does not take into effect how an area may take into effect the stat gain of a particular monster.  The negatives may outweigh the positives in this matter.

 I always try to train my monsters in the area they match, not the area where the &#34;best drills&#34; are.  I tried to raise a Scissor &#40;Goat breed of Beaklon&#41; in Kalaragi and it went horribly &#40;my raising style kept pulling towards Hard&#41;.  He&#39;s now not even three years old and is getting stat gains like an old man.  I&#39;ll never repeat that mistake again.

 One of the in-game messages from Mosha is that there are certain areas that certain monsters just won&#39;t train well in. Farns and NightFlyers, for instance, like Kalaragi, Morx and really like Takrama, but only do acceptably in Brillia.

 Well, I will vouch for Farns in Takrama.  Valkyries, too, for that matter.  Both breeds did quite well in the Takrama. <BR> <BR>Hmmm, if we don&#39;t have this info somewhere, amybe we should start.  I gotta go check.

 By watching the gains and losses, so far. I&#39;ve not had anything just refuse to train in an area yet, but I&#39;m only twenty-two years in. But areas that are good to train in, your monster will have good gains in the major and minor stats and minimal losses in the reducing stat, example: up 20, up 10, down 2. This marks good areas for me. Areas where you get 16-18 up, 9-11 up and 5 down would seem to me to be areas where they don&#39;t like to train. Also, like Nate, raising style tends toward Harder or Hard instead of Normal. More research is needed to see if there really are areas some monsters won&#39;t train in. I raised a Golem in Takrama and couldn&#39;t stay away from Hard, but Daruma Rock is just too good for a Golem to pass up.

 I think we should look beyond basic breeds towards overall trends.  Let me start, and everyone chime in with their comparable or contrasting experiences: <BR> <BR>&#42;Goat-types work well in Brillia, but not in Kalaragi. <BR> <BR>&#42;Morx-types work well in Kalaragi, but only average in Takrama.

 I think it comes down to a pair of factors that make certain regions more compatible: Heat and Moisture. <BR> <BR>Goat for example has really High Moisture and mid &#40;probably&#41; temperature. <BR> <BR>Kalaragi has high temperature and high moisture. <BR> <BR>Brillia has probably mid to high moisture, and really low temperature. <BR> <BR>Morx is probably mid temperature and moisture. <BR> <BR>Takrama is almost certainly high temp and low moisture. <BR> <BR>Creatures native to those areas are naturally adapted to those conditions. They are comfortable in areas with closer conditions. <BR>A creature from Goat would probably handle brilla or kalaragi well, but have trouble in Takrama. <BR>A creature from Morx should handle any place averagely. <BR>A creature from Takrama would probably feel more at home in Kalaragi than Goat because of the presumably closer temperature. <BR>And of course characteristics modify all this.

 That&#39;s what I used to think.  But then my Scissor &#40;Beaklon/Goat&#41; did horribly in Kalaragi, which logically would be a good match for it.  My Fukazo &#40;Suezo/Goat&#41; did great in Brillia, which might be an okay match for it, but my pure Zan &#40;Brillia-type&#41; did lackluster in Goat, so the reverse doesn&#39;t seem to be true.  My Kyuza &#40;Henger/Morx&#41; did fair in Takrama, but great in Kalaragi. <BR> <BR>Also, my Ogyo &#40;Goat-type&#41; did absolutely horribly in Morx when I first started the game, and now that I&#39;ve had a chance to raise her in Goat she&#39;s doing moderately acceptable. <BR> <BR>Well, in any case I&#39;ll be trying out more of this when I raise my Pancho, who&#39;s slated &#40;har!&#41; to inherit my Ogyo&#39;s heart when she passes on.

 Oh yes...I&#39;m also trying to continue this elsewhere on the board, if you&#39;d like to contribute there.  If we get enough people participating in solving this puzzle, it may be FAQ-worthy!

 That probably means that Goat is actually a low temperature area, and that temperature is a stronger determinant than moisture.

 Ive been testing this, and with most monster it works well. The more a monster like the localized food in an area, the better they train in that area.

 FFX gives merman.  Also, my goat-type tiger was awsome in brillia, and horrible in Morx &#40;i had to move him to stop him from evolving to a Tiger.&#41; <BR> <BR>And how the heck does Goat cure cold?  that seems to imply that it&#39;s warm.  and it IS kind of tropicalish...

After nearly 50 years of training I&#39;ve never noticed anything of this like. The only odd thing I&#39;ve noted is that when I was training my Joker, <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Arawn</FONT>, he seemed to get Spd faster than Int in Kalaragi while his stats seem to suggest that vice versa would be in order.
