 Working on the Jimsey quest, I managed to lose to our resident maniacal redhead, and she demanded a certain fruit for ransom.  The next search period, I missed where the fruit was &#40;went left instead of right&#41;, and thus got the hint for the next search.  Okay, all well and good... save that searching the spot _causes Fleria to just repeat what she said at the start instead of finding the fruit!_  ARRRGH.   <BR> <BR>I was using the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon dragon evolved to a Dragon/Morx at the time.

 Update: When I moved to Morx to start training a different monster, I got the same message while searching above.  Joyous.   <BR> <BR>So, recommended warning: When you meed Jimsey, _save your game immediately_.  Make this a fresh save, and use this save tree, until/if you complete the Jimsey story tree.  It may be a game debilitating bug if you&#39;re unable to bring it to completion.  I&#39;m starting from near scratch &#40;since I can at least encyclopedia swap in a lot of the creatures from previous&#41;, and hopefully I&#39;ll have more info when I deal with this again.

 I had this same problem, too.  It&#39;s pissing me off terribly.  I have only one save block, and the block I am on that is bugged has the monster I raised that beat Ragnarox on it. <BR> <BR>Let me know what you find out about it.  I&#39;ll let you know if I ever get around it.

 Uuurgh. I unfortunately saved at the wrong place as well, and don&#39;t think I have any saves from just after meeting Jimsey, before fighting the redhead.  <BR> <BR>Does anyone know just what this story tree does, and if it&#39;s really important to the game? Or am I going to probably have to start again from scratch &#40;which I really don&#39;t wanna do?&#41;

 Yep it got me too. Talk about major suckage. I hate to throw away the progress I&#39;ve made. If I have to start over I&#39;m gonna beat that Gadamon&#39;s <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> so hard every time I see her.....

 As a further note, I was wondering if maybe Fleria&#39;s repetition of what she said before just means that you didn&#39;t happen to find it that go-round... since they &#42;did&#42; say that the fruit is really rare. <BR> <BR>&#40;As a side note that isn&#39;t really related to this for most people... what&#39;s the story with the Pandora Disc? Can you only gain each monster as you go up in each rank, or can you belatedly get the lower rank monsters from the disc? I ask in connection with this, because since I&#39;m at rank S, once I get the disc, that might be a good time to start over anyhow, so that I can get all the monsters, if you can&#39;t get &#39;em belatedly.&#41;

 ... and now that I think about it, does beating <BR>Gadamon even keep you from having to find the fruit? <BR> <BR>It seems like a pretty big plot point, and I don&#39;t put it past her to refuse to hand over the kid even if you beat her, unless you bring her the fruit... anyone know for sure? <BR> <BR>&#40;I think I&#39;m just gonna start over, anyhow... &#42;whimper&#42;&#41;

 I beat her, and she did hand over the kid. Later in the game, he came to me in the Jungle region and gave me back the money he stole and an Oodori fruit as a thank you for saving him. I have no idea what the fruit is good for, though. Any ideas? I&#39;ll experiment with it at some point. <BR> <BR>The only thing I can say is: Start multiple saves and switch between them every time you save. That way you can go back if you have to.

 Maybe another bug, though...or I don&#39;t know how the disc chips work. I got 4 of the chips for the little bell monster, but when I tried to turn them in Grandpa said that I had collected all of that type of monster. I hadn&#39;t, though. I have three area variants and one special. I know there&#39;s one I don&#39;t have, from the forest area. <BR> <BR>After he said I couldn&#39;t turn in the chips, three of them disappeared and I had one jell chip and one bell monster chip! It kinda sucks that I spent the time to collect them and now I can&#39;t use them. <BR> <BR>This happen to anyone else? <BR> <BR>Or am I doing something wrong? <BR> <BR>BTW, check out the desert mew! I thought I had a special...

 Well, the same thing happened to my wife. She turned in her Pixie disc and Grandpa told her that she had collected all the monsters of that type. Maybe they only give you the basic monster of the chip type, because she already had the basic pixie and I had the basic bell monster. <BR> <BR>His response makes no sense in that case, but that wouldn&#39;t be too unusual. <BR> <BR>Also, all her pixie chips disappeared. I think I was mistaken in my previous post...I must have had a Jell chip and an extra bell chip. Taking the chips away isn&#39;t cool, because you can trade them for others. Luckily, I saved before I tried it. <BR> <BR>I have to say, only getting the basic monsters is a little useless, at least so far.

 This happened to me too: <BR>&#34;I beat her, and she did hand over the kid. Later in the game, he came to me in the Jungle region and gave me back the money he stole and an Oodori fruit as a thank you for saving him.&#34; <BR> <BR>I seem to be fine, but left the area right afterwards, just in case. Oh yes, I beat her, but did not KO the monster.

 Nope, got it in Inventory. &#42;G&#42; Now, if you wanna ask how many tries &#40;resets&#41; it took me to get through the Aurora tournament, we could talk about over and over and over...
