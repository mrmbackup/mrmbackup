 Well as some of you know, a couple of us have been working on cracking save files.  I have brought out 3 jokers &#40;Dave, Dave and Dave&#41; and by changing some digits, I&#39;ve made Dave 3 years old with about 12 years of life left.  I&#39;ll be playing with him and recording the birthday songs to see if they go on and on.  If so, the hypothesis will be that the game wrote in birthday songs beyond 5 years, because something could get you there.  We&#39;ll find out.  First up is the 3 year song. <BR> <BR>Lyrics:   Over seas and sand. Dave the best in the land!

 So far it matches what Trickster &amp; Torey posted in the FAQ in September, after seeing them in gameplay.

 Also note that in MR1 &amp; 2, after a certain number of years the birthday songs simply stop happening, but it is possible to have a monster far older than that year.

 6 year old story. <BR> <BR>She tells him he&#39;s very healthy.  Then says here&#39;s a song to celebrate 6 years of life.  Here I go. <BR> <BR>6 year old Lyrics:  It didn&#39;t take long.  Dave now you&#39;re strong! <BR> <BR>These are the same lyrics as the first birthday.  Seems the game doesn&#39;t think a monster can make it to 6 years old, so it doesn&#39;t have a specific song for it.  So the guess here would be that anyone claiming life longer than that off the rest chart is lying, because the game doesn&#39;t allow for a new song over 5 years old. <BR> <BR>Now for some numbers. From my gave save research, I saw that when a healthy monster rested, it&#39;s life left meter decreased by 9.  For Joker, the meter starts at hex number DF 07 &#40;2015&#41; or &#40;223 &#43; &#40;7&#42;256&#41;&#41; which equals 2015.  2015/9 &#40;9 equaling the life lost by a week of rest&#41; = 223.88 weeks of life.  which is 4 years 2 months just like the chart says.

 After the song, she asks how it is like always.  Then she gives you a wide eyed dirty look.  Much different than normal of the sinister look she gives after the 4 year old song <BR> <BR>While doing so she says, &#34;I hope I can sing for you next year too!

 Thanks for confirming that part of the lifespan chart.  <BR> <BR>In MR1 when I raised my golem on week only and fed meat, and got him to 17&#43; years old, after a while the songs just stopped coming. Of course, I was using a life-extending item. My concern is that there may be a life-extending item &#40;like a peach, plant egg, or MR1 meat&#41; which would also do the same thing in MR3.

 Ah, so it might be possible... I wonder what happens if you get a monster past 99 years old in MR1&amp;2....? It&#39;s theoretically possible.... I mean, when you reached year 9999 the game ended, so what would happen if you have a 100 year old monster?

 I guess it&#39;s possible, with a cheating/hacking device, which seems to be...nevermind.

 I got a MR1 monster to 17&#43; years, it took about 2 months of ranching for a couple hours every day. Sorry, I just don&#39;t have the patience to keep going with him.

 ya - once you get all the techs, and maxx out the stats, continuing to raise a monster just to make it older gets real tired real quick.

 Actually Lisa, this is good stuff.   <BR>What this confirms is that I now know the values and addresses of lifespan remaining.  So now I can test all game items to see if any have an effect on the remaining lifespan number.  If I give an item and it increases the number than we know what it does.  Or if I give the item and then rest a week and lose less than 9 &#40;like give vine grass and rest takes off 6 instead of 9 or something like that&#41; off the register than we know it could extend life that way.

 I think the interesting thing here is the value nine given to rest.  Let&#39;s pretend &#40;since we don&#39;t know yet&#41;, that a succesful light drill is 10 fatigue and 5 stress like in MR2.  o.k.  and lets say that stress is equal to twice the value of fatigue like in MR2.  It used to be that when you reached the mystical number 70 you lost a week of life.  Here, it&#39;s possible that once you reach the plateau &#40;like a composite 70&#41; you start losing points off the register.  Say 74 means 4 lost off the register.  It&#39;s possible that life loss or gain could not be a solid number which is why giving one item the week before death wouldn&#39;t change anything.  Say a black pearl would be &#43;2 to the register &#40;hence the price difference for items&#41;.  Give 5 and you extend a week. but one..nope. &#40;I know this isn&#39;t true of BP but it&#39;s just an example&#41;.
