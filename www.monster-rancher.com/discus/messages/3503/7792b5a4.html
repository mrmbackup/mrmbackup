 I am in the process of raising my s class fenrick tourney monster.  with sofia&#39;s heart, and with a ceiling of 4349 maximum composite, i would not need to use the dmm/campster for the points involved.  however, it occurs to me that, in order to be sure that i max my techs, i am going to dmm my monster from 9 mos until first growth - solely to get my battle sense up to A.  so, my goal is simple:  get in a battle with an enemy and ko him.  i will accept any venture result which includes this, so long as i get refreshment where i need it, and stay in the plus range of statgain.  what i am trying to say in this post is, simply by adjusting the definition of a successful venture, the dmm/campster can be used to obtain a large number of outcomes. <BR> <BR>it is obvious, but i have been helped by posts that state the obvious, so i decided to post this.

 Yeah, but the only thing that confuses me is that by DMM&#39;ing you get tech levels faster than by normal training.... Sure, you get 1/5 the points but you get to do it 12 times more often.

 you would &#42;if&#42; you spent the 300 venture lifepoints on noisy halls...as an aid to maxing, those points often are better used to get statgain, get refreshment or stress relief to assist your monster in its restless life, or battles with enemies. <BR> <BR>right now, just by battling enemies, my battle sense is up to C.  Once I get it to A, i will go back to normal training, and the combination of the extra stats from dmm time and 70 pts per noisy hall will get me where i want to go with time to spare, by my calculations...and then i get to bring the form to where i want it as well.

 There has been some confusion about what I did to the DMM method or what to do with it.  What follows is a copy of what I placed on the other board. <BR> <BR>REVISED METHOD <BR> <BR>This is an adjustment and revision of the Digmoshmogi method with compliments and thanks to anyone who helped him with it.. It really only borrows from the principles. <BR> <BR>The purpose of the method is to get as close to 999 in every stat category possible, and max all your techniques. <BR> <BR>Assumptions. The first is you have a beginning monster with a stat composite of 600&#43; and will be giving him a heart from a monster with a 3000 stat composite &#40;600 points passed on&#41;, and it’s forte maxed out. Assuming you have the bit/stone or orb for the heart monsters forte and can give it to this monster on his first venture. Assuming the date is Feb 4th week, year 1050 &#40;got to have a starting date&#41;. We’ll assume this monster is a Zan with 4 years 11 months of expected lifespan &#40;236 weeks&#41;. For simplicity sake, we’ll call this Zan “BOB”. So when I say “Bob”, I mean your monster. This will work for any breed, just adjust for his expected lifespan. Assuming you have the best durable items in inventory. <BR> <BR>CYCLE 1 <BR> <BR>Shrine “Bob” on the 4th week of Feb. Take him to Morx. Don&#39;t give him his heart till you get the forte&#39; technique from the lord on your first venture. You’ll spend the first 3-6 months in Morx &#40;After that, train wherever comfortable&#41;. I’ve found it easier to pass drills early in life in Morx. Find a food item &#40;from inventory&#41; “Bob” hates and feed it too him. Then find a gift item “Bob” likes a lot and give it to him. I have found that doing this early helps bond quickly and reduces failures. This is just my experience and a suggestion.. Immediately Save the game. You want to save before you drill or venture. Drill him in whatever he’s best at first to reduce failure. If Bob fails, only answer with “Try harder” if he mocks you or if he’s looks exhausted say “Keep at it”.  <BR> <BR>After drilling, venture. IMPORTANT!!!You should give Bob whatever technique you are passing on at this time. Later, Bob will find an Orb on his own to give you your 4th Tech. On these ventures, you’re looking for 3 things.  <BR>1.        Shells that relieve Stress &#40;very important&#41; and Refresh &#40;even more important&#41;. <BR>2.        15 stat points from stars, leafs, succulent fruit etc… &#40;you know, “You found a succulent fruit. Bob’s power greatly increased….&#43;4 power 124-128”&#41;. <BR>3.        A battle with less than 100 ran ran steps left. Not necessary, but important at first. <BR> <BR>First you always buy the most expensive ran ran, so have a lot of cash on hand. This method can be expensive. As Torey has reported, many players who venture and find a shell that greatly relieves stress, experience more success while drilling including more greats. I saw the same thing. You want the shells that say more refreshed, because it relieves fatigue meaning you never have to rest. You want the 15 stat point gain for this reason. <BR> <BR>Bob’s longest possible lifespan is 236 weeks. You’ll lose 50 &#43; weeks of possible training with this method due to battles and rest and Bob starts with 1200 for stats &#40;600&#43;600&#41;. He needs 3795 more to max out his stats. So he needs to average 20 points per training week for his lifetime. If you hold out to find at least 15 to 20 points on venture alone, you’ll be ahead of the game after one year. <BR> <BR>You want to battle if possible at the end of the venture about 15 times &#40;not much more, so count&#41; in your first year of life. Doing this and going to tourneys will get your Battle Sense after 1 year to Battle Sense “A”. Don’t accept a battle at the beginning or middle of the venture as this wastes good ran ran &#40;just reset&#41;. IMPORTANT!!! Once at Battle Sense “A” avoid battles as much as possible to save lifespan. If you have ran ran left after unlocking all light of earth areas…do a noisy hall….Every little bit helps. <BR> <BR>After his first venture, give him his heart to max out the passed on technique. Then go back to the shrine and hibernate. Now get out a dummy monster. And train till March 4th week &#40;3 weeks&#41;. Hibernate and get back out Bob. Win “E” class. Hibernate. Get out the Dummy monster and train till May 4th week. Hibernate and get Bob out. Venture with the same rules &#40;you must get refreshed on a venture before battle&#41;. Hibernate 3 weeks and come out on June 4th week. Beat “D” Class. Hibernate till August 4th week. Venture. Hibernate till Sept 4th week…then beat “C” class. At this point you should be Battle Sense D.  <BR> <BR>Now you will hibernate till the week before ventures &#40;Feb. 4th week, May 4th week, August 4th week, Nov 4th week&#41; till the monster is 6 months old. He’ll turn 6 months year 1055 after Nov 4th week. Hibernate 3 weeks and then come out and beat “B” class December 4th week. You are now old enough and confident enough to start trying Hard drills. Every other Venture, do a Hard drill/Light drill. Now return to training on only venture weeks till Bob turns 1 year old. This should be around Nov. 4th week 1061. Do the venture then hibernate 3 weeks and Beat “A” class. Now, if you’ve fought 15ish random battles on Venture and fought in all 5 tourney’s, you should now be Battle sense “A”. Here’s the math after 1 year. You Fought 4 times in the first year &#40;5th time was 1yr, 0 weeks old&#41;, did 33 light drills and 11 hard drills. You should have averaged 9 points per light drill, 14 points per hard drill and 17 points for each of the 44 ventures. <BR> <BR>1200 &#43; &#40;33&#42;9&#41; &#43; &#40;11&#42;14&#41; &#43; &#40;44&#42;17&#41;.= 1200 &#43; 297 &#43; 154 &#43; 748 = 2399 &#40;about 480 per category&#41;. You are now 2596 short. You’ve lived 48 weeks, and should have lost around 20 weeks to Battles &#40;we’ll call it an even 70 weeks used just in case&#41;. So you have about 166 weeks of life left.  <BR> <BR>CYCLE 2 <BR> <BR>You will now follow a different method for the next 2 and ½&#43; years. You will drill 13 weeks at a time. This is where you raise your techs and where Battle Sense &#34;A&#34; is worth it&#39;s money. <BR> <BR>After beating “A”, hibernate for 11 weeks and come out on Feb 4th week. Do the normal method for training, avoid battle on ventures as much as possible now to not lose weeks of life &#40;I’ve found a good way to do this is alternate venture sites&#41;. Venture this week as before. After venturing, train 3 to 4 weeks then rest one. Until the next venture. On this venture, do all three noisy halls. Since you’ve not hibernated within 12 weeks, you’ll get the full benefit. After the noisy halls, try to get refreshed and gain at least 7 points. After Venturing, hibernate 11 weeks and repeat this cycle. You can do this 10 times and he’ll be approximately 3 and ½&#43;. Doing so will yield 10 ventures at 17ish points. 10 ventures at 10ish points. 30 weeks of rest and 100 weeks of training at 20 points a week and 30 noisy hall trips at 75 points each for 2250 or about 20 additional skill levels. Bob will have about 25 to 35 weeks of life left. He gains about 2270 this way and is now about 326 points short of maxing everything. You may now beat “S” Class, S invitational’s and Ragnarox &#40;if you haven’t already&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you aren’t happy with 900 &#43; in each category and want to max all 5 out, just continue cycle 1, 3 months longer or restart cycle 1 after cycle 2. <BR> <BR>This method needs the owner to do 3 things well. <BR> <BR>1.        Patience. Stick to the method. Don’t get bored and train during year one. His stat gains are crept and it’s a waste of a perfectly good venture week to stray from the method. Plus resets take time. <BR>2.        Save before every venture so you can reset. <BR>3.        Money. You’ll have to buy items to help reduce failures. Especially, if you aren’t changing locations on ventures and stop getting stress and fatigue reducing items. Plus every venture costs $2000. <BR> <BR>Feel free to make any suggestions if I missed something. But I did just max out a Kuririn using a similar but less organized method.

thanx campster. <BR> <BR>the key to my training with dmm/campster now is flexibility.  you take the three key steps listed above, and add a fourth. <BR> <BR>4&#93; know where you want to end up with your monster, and set the definition of what a successful venture is accordingly. <BR> <BR>i mean, you can do some pretty spectacular things with this method, if you are willing to spend a great deal of time and money.  you could set your parameters to only accept a venture where you got &#43;10 statgain, stress reduction, refreshment and fight an enemy monster...and as long as you keep resetting &#91;sometimes a change of venture location helps too&#93; eventually you <B>WILL</B> achieve this.  but it is going to take a long time.  keep this up long enough, and you can maxx the stats and techs of the most miserable monster without even using a heart. <BR> <BR>you can also do some pretty mundane things with this method.  say you are raising a monster for fenrick&#39;s b class tournament.  you have a big time heart, and you have a long lived monster.  the only thing you need dmm/campster for is to guarantee that you max your techs.  well, then dmm/campster for a few months, and take any venture where you fight an enemy and get a ko.  in a little while, you will be at battle sense A, and the rest is automatic. <BR> <BR>there are any number of possible choices of &#34;acceptable venture&#34; between these two extremes.  happy ranching!

 I don&#39;t really like how you handled Cycle 2.... For those of us who&#39;d like to max monsters as fast as possible, wouldn&#39;t it be better to stick with Ventures as often as possible? Like every week? The only negative I see is that it would be next to impossible to keep the vegetarians fattened up &#40;And I&#39;ve noticed that if my monster is off of the &#34;Normal&#34; weight it fails more often&#41;. But most monsters that appeal to people would be meat-eaters, so it shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem there.

 Actually, the purpose to breaking the method off at 1 year is this.  Maxing is overkill.  I get a real high from comparing Sofia, Reilly and Harry in 1 on 1 battles.  Seeing all those 9&#39;s is a poweful feeling.  But let&#39;s be real. Cycle 2 yields about 110 drills at about 18 points each or about 2000 stat gain points.  You start with about 1200-1400 depending on the heart.  So that&#39;s already 3300 ish points.  So doing this method for the first year gives you about 750 extra points or a stat composite of about 4000 &#40;that&#39;s 800 per category or 4 maxed out&#41;.  That&#39;s enough.  One month of this method with 3 resets per venture week takes about an hour.  So doing it for 1 year takes about 12 game playing hours.  That&#39;s enough don&#39;t you think.  Now, do it for 1 year and 9 months to 2 years and you&#39;ll max out but that&#39;d add 9 to 12 more hours on to game play.  It the interim, your dummy monsters are only getting raised randomly with no benefit to techs or anything.  Personal choice really.  But here&#39;s the deal with cycle 2.  You&#39;re at battle sense &#34;A&#34;.  It takes about 1200 tech points to max a stat &#40;it&#39;s distributed evenly among levels and I&#39;m not sure of the exact amount but It takes more points if the tech has less levels&#41;.  At battle sense &#34;A&#34;, a venture yields 225ish points.  Now if you passed on 1 maxed out and you start cycle 2 at 1 year old you&#39;ll get 1 or 2 at sense &#34;B&#34; and 10 at sense &#34;A&#34;.  Thats about 2600 tech points or 3&#43; techs maxed out total and over 4000 stat composite.  That&#39;s a killer monster without the extra 9 hours &#43; of game play.  Now, if you hold off cycle 2 and go to training techs during you venture for the first 2 years, you can max your techs and get more stats.  It&#39;s all about your investment of time really.
