 i have discussed elsewhere my love for little cheap techs, that only do a little damage, but dont cost much guts, and, more importantly, do not take up a lot of animation time.  previous favorite cheap techs include pixie raycast and cp swing. <BR> <BR>well, now i have a new favorite.  jell charge, for only 11 guts, does 15 damage, gets you a tiny bit of gutsdown, and, even against the fastest guts regen monster, takes less than 10 gutspoints for the animation to run.  all hail jell charge!

 torey, true. my imagine all the 10-gut attacks getting dished out. let&#39;s say 4 times, and would 4 times the time it takes to execute those attacks be the same as a 40-gut attack?

 nope...the 40 gut attack gets executed in about half the time.  however, the 40 guts attack doesnt do 4 times the damage - even if it hits, and it doesnt do 4 times the gutsdown, because the other monster builds back half its guts during the attack being launched.

 Cheap techs? I like Hengar&#39;s Drill Punch and Golem&#39;s Finger Flick. But then, there is a lot of the ten-guts techs that I like. I usually leave at least one of such techniques on each monster I raise.

 yeah, but the problem with long animations is that the opponent can easily recover all the guts that are drained, and then some, on long moves. Good counters for this are short moves, like Henger&#39;s beam. Although I do certainly agree that long, stall-match moves are VERY useful from time to time.

 If I use a stall move, it&#39;s usually if I have a lot of guts and my opponent has very little guts. That way, while time is running, they&#39;ll recover guts, but I&#39;ll still have more guts then they do. Of course, I don&#39;t attack until I have more guts then the opponent, which isn&#39;t hard since I raise speed demons.

 Heaven Bolt is Flare Orb, requires 50 Guts and is the 4th strongest tech in the game with 67 Damage. I think Zero to Sixty also requires 50 Guts. These guys are looking for low/medium guts moves with nice damage.

 Well, there is a bad side to stall moves. If your opponent does foolery, you might not be able to hit them with the attack before the foolery ends.

 999 speed solves that, but it takes quite a few generations to get that before S-class when it&#39;s not nearly as useful. <BR> <BR>P.S.

 Your foolery argument isn&#39;t so acurate, if you mind me interjecting. The move is calculated DURING that close up of it. I should know, I successfully landed backspin with a 130 speed Armaroller against a 600 speed monster, and guess what!? Both were DURING foolery, and otherwise none were landed. <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;m gonna do some further experiments on this after school. Allrighty then, cyas!

 How could you do a tech during foolery? Also, I think it is decided at the beginning of the animation as well, mainly from the attack 10:10. If you&#39;ve ever seen it hit &#40;I&#39;ve seen it hit a few select times, though not all that often&#41;, you&#39;ll notice that the Mew jumps up and makes it&#39;s shadow on the moon &#40;Which looks pretty durn cool, imo&#41; but it won&#39;t if it misses.

 i agree khift -i have seen my monster and the enemy monster dodge during foolery, but i cannot make my monster launch an attack during foolery. <BR> <BR>and i also agree that there are slightly different animations for hits and misses from the getgo - watching countless battles on ventures, i have noticed that the background goes dark and the camera angle gets closer on many techs.  if it hits, it stays that way, but if it is going to miss, the background almost immediately lightens up, and the camera angle subtly changes.

in a max monster tourney, a cheap tech that does less than 80 damage is useless.  db and tb opined that the cutoff would be ~15 in the damage column.  but here is a partial list of what has helped and what hasnt...  <B>helpful</B>  colorpandora swing...jell charge...golem slap.  <B>unhelpful</B> suezo lick...pixie raycast...suzurin aim hit. <BR> <BR>notice that suezo lick falls into the unhelpful category, despite having a big gutsdown factor.  i am finding that gutsdown is not helpful, at least in little techs &#91;it can help to make a &#34;big&#34; tech even bigger&#93;.  the animation time and guts cost combine so that by the time the atack is over, a lot of the gutsdown is recovered anyway.

 i&#39;ve also noticed for Mews, Hawaiian cost 21 guts, does 12 damage when maxed, and has like 37 gutsdown. This IMO opinion will not help you either, due to the long time it takes to perform the move, the little damage it does, and the other Mew can get back almost all of the guts it lost. just helping you guys out,even though i shouldnt! :$

 I have to squeeze my opinion in here. <BR>Gutsdown is a defensive move; damage is an offensive move. A cheap defensive tech, no matter how great, sucks compared to a cheap offensive tech, as well as sucking in general. Gutsdown is ineffective, no matter how great or cheap, against faster guts regenerating monsters and against monsters who have a solid tech array. I agree with Torey &#40;as well as others&#41; that gutsdown isn&#39;t helpful alone or with low damage. A great example of this would be Wordplay vs. Ryukyu IMO. <BR> <BR>&#40;I know torey was the one asked, but...&#41;I still like cheap little techs and will try to include them on my future monsters until I feel it harmed my monster more than helped it.

 It&#39;s not really the actual damage done on impact that I was asking about. What I was curious about was if anyone was seeing the cheap techs getting used a lot &#40;and just nibbling away in terms of damage&#41;, thus preventing the higher cost attacks from being used. I noticed that one entrant in the Hengar event almost nver used the all-powerful Ion Cannon because as soon as enough guts were built up for a cheaper tech, the computer used that one. It seemed like only after several consecutive blocks/dodges or pull-backs did more costly techs get used.

 Have to disagree with the Suezo Lick being unhelpful.  Just completed the game using a Tanuzo whose primary attack was Lick.  Beat all 5 champions and Raggy.  985 int, 997 spd, and a final record of 76-5.  The five losses could have been avoided too, I was pushing the s class tourney about 6 months too soon.  The gutsdown effect stays ahead of the cost on all but the highest regen critters.  As the one rival said...what a terrible way to lose.

 bladerunner, &#34;what a terrible way to lose&#34; is a form statement - certain opponents say that after any loss. <BR> <BR>in-game opponents are not the final measure of the strength or weakness of a tech, imo.  i have beaten the game with a 2500 composite octopee using only miminta.  ditto with a pow pixie and an int baku. <BR> <BR>my statement instead dealt with the increasing situation i find myself in - dealing with how to beat maxx or near-maxx monsters.  based on my own in-house tourneys and now the latest result from fenrick&#39;s tourney, i remain of the opinion that given two maxx suezos, the one without lick is stronger than the one with lick.

 Torey, I know it is a canned response.  I still thought it humorous.  Perhaps I should have put the smiley face there so you knew it was meant to be so.  ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Did not realize this discussion was about tourney with near max monsters and the computer controlling them.  If someone other the computer was controlling them, then the Lick suezo would still win most of the time if he gets the first lick in &#40;pun intended&#41;.  The move can keep any but the highest regen creatures below 30 guts and is the 2nd best to hit of the int attacks &#40;after the weaker damage psychokinesis&#41;.  If the ai is controlling, however, then you are right and it would not work well.

 Stall attacks are the best.  While a bit pricey, I like Zan&#39;s Axes Ballet. It takes up a lot of time, is quite accurate, and particularly lethal.

 Well, my opinion of of a &#34;cheap tech&#34; is one that that does a lot of damage and hits often, regardless of guts cost. I have three &#34;cheap techs&#34; that I&#39;ve found very useful. One is Ogyo&#39;s Final Dance: it does A LOT of damage with only 36 guts cost. The other one is Tiger&#39;s Moon Assault: it does EVEN MORE damage than Final Dance, with a guts cost of 50 &#40;a little pricy&#41;, but a hit of 50! <BR>The final one &#40;also for Tiger&#41; is Tiger Combo: a pricy guts cost of 50, but its backed up with a hit of 48 and HIGH DAMAGE. That&#39;s just my $.02...

 those might be &#34;cost-efficient&#34; techs, ko, but they don&#39;t come cheap.  two things - first, near the end of a match, if you only have 25 or so guts, but need to get one more shot in, they don&#39;t help you at all.  second, they take up a lot of animation time.  now that part can be good or bad, depending on if you are protecting a lead, or if you are trying to come from behind.

 Just about the only &#34;Bit&#34; techs that I use are ones that cause Dizzy &#40;and Hawaiian, God I love it&#41;. Examples: Dragon&#39;s Wing Storm, Psiroller&#39;s Mosin, Jell&#39;s Jell Sweep, etc.
