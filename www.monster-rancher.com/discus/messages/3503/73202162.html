 The manual for monster rancher 3 states that raising power or intelligence decreases the amount of damage you take from the same likeness of moves.  I have noticed that this is true in many cases.  For example my monsters usually have low intelligence and high power and whenever an enemy attacks with an intellegence move I sustain more damage. I have also noticed in frequent battles with rivals that the more power that my monsters have the less damage they take from other monster power attacks.  I have two questions.  When you have a really low stat like power or intelligence, is the amount of damage from the other monsters opposing stat very significant or not? Also, for people who have and intelligence of 1, do you monster take a lot of damage from an intelligence based move?

 yes, to both.  my raising method, based on ideas of psych0midget et al, is to allow the unused stat &#91;like int in a baku or pow in an octopee&#93; to go to 1 very early in life, so that the harder drills are all pure profit in prime. <BR> <BR>then, i have 5 pow monsters and 5 int monsters whose vs data i have saved, and who i square off in comp v comp 1p-2p battles. 1-pow int monsters are devastated by 1-int pow monsters and vice versa.  999s happen quite commonly, no matter how high def is, or whether you have armor/stome skin.tough skin, etc. <BR> <BR>someone at tecmo theorized that, because of this, you should let def go to 1, and raise the corresponding stat instead.  i raised a few monsters this way, but my experience tends to show otherwise...a 1 def monster with 500 pow will take slightly more damage from a pow tech than a 1 pow monster with 500 def.

 I try to compensate in some breeds by raising Speed, so they just don&#39;t get hit. This advice won&#39;t work with all breeds, but recently had it work nicely with Zan and Naga.

 The monster that I eventually want to have will have high intelligence and power because the techs of the monster &#40;lesione&#41; very between both stats.  Also with having both high intelligence and power my monster will hopefully take less damage from either type of tech. Thanx for the help.

 I am just curious, but how do moves like Giga blade work, it is a cut/thunder move, and even tough it is displayed as a physical attack, and has a fairly high damage rating it never does more damage than my monster&#39;s remote punch which is a beat move. My monster&#39;s power is 999 and its intel is 73, so this leads me to believe that moves that are both have a phisical part &#40;cut&#41; and a magic part &#40;thunder&#41; use something like an average between the monster&#39;s power and intel. Thats is why the weaker remote punch &#40;beat&#41; dishes out more damage then the stronger giga blade &#40;cut/thunder&#41;

 i wouldn&#39;t mind seeing some numbers, at the same guts level, of how much damage these techs do to a common opponent.  my henger didn&#39;t have either of these techs, so i cannot comment from my own experience.

 If what your saying is correct than that makes some moves for other monsters less powerful.  For instance the dragon move salamander would actually do less damage unless you had high intelligence and power.  I think this is well worth looking in to.

 My Farn had 999 int. and it dished out 999 damage &#40;yes a Farn!&#41; to a dragon , who fought her in rank A. Actually she had exactley 380 for all other stats.&#40;I put int first because I train Pixies and Panchos&#41; <BR> <BR>Also did you notice that mons&#39; with high int. dodge automatically and monsters with high power need you to press a directional button. Maybe its &#39;cos the mon&#39; is dumb and needs to be told to dodge.

 I have just found a &#40;hopefully&#41; good method to making an intelligence and power monster.  I&#39;m testing it out right as I type.  The only problem with the method is that you end up letting you defense go to 1..which i hope to counteract with tough skin, hard scales ect.  I&#39;m also testing the effects of having low def in battle.  Also the method will allow high speed to help avoid hits. &#40;I&#39;m trying to beat my freinds zans&#41; Wish me luck!

 One step ahead of you on the training regiment, but that&#39;s not what I came to say.  I&#39;ve raised several high-speed, low-defense monsters, and I can honestly say that &#34;Fast Footwork&#34; is much more useful on a speed demon than &#34;Armor&#34; &#34;Hard Scales&#34; etc.  If you get hit with &#34;Fast Footwork,&#34; it will really hurt, but if you only have 1 Defense, you&#39;re going to take a beating from hits, anyways.  This is just my opinion, of course.

 i have raised a line of &#34;let the def go to 1&#34; monsters.  however, mine were the 999 pow/int &#43; 999 spd &#43; high life type, rather than high in both pow and int &#91;i never got a monster to 999 in both pow and int, so any data you have on this would be welcome&#93;. <BR> <BR>my only supported observation:  holding all other variables equal &#91;same other stats; same tech; same guts&#93; a monster with 500 int and 1 def will be hurt noticeably more than a monster with 1 int and 500 def.

 Yeah. I ran the last few of my tests last night.  I was a bit dissapointed with the results.  The monster with 999 def and 1 pow took about 480 dmg and the monster with 999 pow and 1 def took about 650 dmg. The move being used on them had a dmg of 41. So yeah.  I think its back to the drawing board, because my entire goal was to be able to use the lesiones moves to there full potential. &#40;both pow and int moves are good&#41;
