While playing last night, I noticed something that I thought was interesting. Although I&#39;d noticed this before, this time it sparked an idea. Please remember that this idea is nearly completely unproved in any way, shape or form, and that which is proved I&#39;ll add &#40;Proven&#41; to it. <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR><CENTER><B>CHARACTER</B></CENTER> <BR> <BR>&#149; As you speak to your monster, not only does it&#39;s willpower change, but another factor that I call character is affected as well.  <BR> <BR>&#149; Aside from the fact that both character and willpower are affected by your reactions, they are completely separated. <BR> <BR>&#149; Character affects the reactions gained from certain responses &#40;Proven&#41;. This can alter the fear/spoil &#40;If they exist here, that is&#41; and stress changes when these reactions are chosen. <BR> <BR>&#149; Character seems to grown in spurts. There just seems to be 3 forms of character, with no in-betweens. <BR> <BR>&#149; Signs of &#39;Good&#39; character would be if your monster responds to a 2/3-4 food &#34;It seems that it understands.&#34; and the reaction to &#34;As expected!&#34; from a Great is &#34;It looks pretty confident.&#34; &#40;Proven&#41; <BR> <BR>&#149; Signs of &#39;Normal&#39; character would be if your monster responds to a 2/3-4 food &#34;It looks like it doesn&#39;t care...&#34; and the reaction to &#34;As expected!&#34; from a Great is &#34;It looks very satisfied!&#34; &#40;Proven&#41; <BR> <BR>&#149; As for signs of &#39;Bad&#39; character, well, I&#39;ve never had a monster get down there. Lisa once noted that when raising a Pancho for the lifespan research, it refused to eat something. I think its safe to say that that would be a sign of &#39;Bad&#39; character. <BR> <BR>&#149; Your monster&#39;s personality greatly affects their ability to change character. My Joker had the personality &#39;Pride&#39;, and never showed signs of &#39;Good&#39; personality until senility set in and he lost that personality. My friend&#39;s Izuna, however, showed signs of &#39;Good&#39; character with the personality &#39;Faithful&#39; in but 8 months of life. My Durahan was even more exceptional - it showed these signs at 4 months with the personality &#39;Stoic&#39;. &#40;Proven&#41; <BR> <BR>&#149; Training style may have an affect on character. If your monster is spoiled, then it may have a more challenging experience in acquiring &#39;Good&#39; character than if it were at &#39;Normal&#39;. It might be the same if you&#39;re being spartan on the poor thing. <BR> <BR>&#149; Character may also affect venture performance. I noticed that my Joker had some problems with finding good venture items, but my Durahan found 3 Big Scales within moments, and good ones too. Also, this could explain Campster&#39;s failure with BruceLee, as Dragons usually start with the personality &#39;Pride&#39;, which is what impeded my Joker&#39;s trek to &#39;Good&#39; personality. <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Could some others comment on this? Have others noticed this as well? I&#39;d really like to hear what you guys think about this.

 i&#39;ve noticed these different reactions too.  right now, all i can say is thanx for taking the time to list them.  unlike the failure reactions, which i have paid a lot of attention to, i really dont have enough memory of how my monsters were doing when they got the differing reactions you describe to comment one way or another.  i&#39;ll try to pay more attention with my future monsters.

 I&#39;ve noticed that if you get up to a &#34;good&#34; character &#40;ie: &#34;it seems it understands&#34; when fed a 2/3-4 food&#41; with a young monster, if they then change their personality when they grow a step &#40;for example, all the pure pixies I&#39;ve seen start with &#34;indignant&#34; and they often lose that and just go to &#34;normal&#34; when they grow the first time&#41; their character will revert to &#34;normal&#34; &#40;ie: &#34;it doesn&#39;t care.&#34;&#41;
