 I now believe stress plays a large role in how a monster performs at drills, and how long it lives.  I believe that it builds up from week to week, even though the only time fleria will give you a stress warning is at the same time she gives a fatigue warning.   <BR> <BR>I have no systematic research or testing pursuant to the scientific method to back me up.  What i have is an informal, &#34;kept track of in my head&#34; method for keeping track of stress, that i used on my dmm/campster henger, SirOck. <BR> <BR>I assigned an arbitrary value to the stress associated with the various drills.  lif = 1; one up one down = 2; two up one down = 3; and the bottom drill in each area = 4.  I am not at all sure that these are the right values &#91;in fact, when I told Lisa i was going to post this, she told me that tararara has already discovered that the life drills are not all the same in every region, so i am pretty sure that my values are incorredt in that regard&#93;.  I did not factor in stress from scolding; the effect of items&#91;one-time or durable&#93;; or the effect of feeding different foods. <BR> <BR>I didnt have to deal with battles, and their effect, because my monster never battled, except at errantry.  when he found a shell/nanabukana/crystal egg/dried rain carp/sweet chestnut that eased stress, i assigned that a value of 1 for slight; 2 for basic relief and 4 for very relieved.  evil leeches always use the same language, so i assigned their stress a value of 2. <BR> <BR>Even with as crude and incomplete a method as this, though, it became fairly obvious that as my stress number approached 0, my monster had significantly more greats and almost never failed.  When the number got higher than 5, he would frequently fail all but the simplest of drills, and never got great.  As i decided which ventures to accept, and which to reset, it struck me that i was better off with a monster who &#34;seemed a little tired&#34; and had 0 stress, who could be counted on to succeed in a lif drill, than with one who was &#34;full of energy&#34; but was also full of stress, who might have a failure week the next venture no matter what. <BR> <BR>I just want to throw these ideas out there.  I will be keeping more detailed track, and maybe posting it, with my dmm/campster mew, to come in late july or august.

 Good observations torey. I haven&#39;t had a failure week i wasn&#39;t able to overcome yet with my current monster under the DMM/campster method, but indeed, understanding the value of stress on lifespan and great/sucess/failure could prove very useful to ranchers striving to perfect their raising methods. There are a few more questions I&#39;d like to have answered about stress. Does resting relieve stress in any way? Does raising while tired more stressful than otherwise? If the stress number was 0, then what were the other failures caused by &#40;&#34;almost never&#34;&#41;? <BR>Stress has many intricacies. <BR>Hopefully curiousity won&#39;t kill the cat, or in this case the mew.  <BR>Good work again.

 &#40;also testing if I can post here yet, if you can read this then... Good job, you&#39;re litterate :P&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyways, I agree... While I was training my Oh-Gi-Yo &#40;ogyo&#41; I came to a point right at a venture where I would do a drill and it was a &#34;GREAT!&#34; on seemingly no matter what drill I chose.  The week before I also got a Great.  So... After those 2 greats came a failure week... Or was it? <BR>On the 4th week &#40;the 2nd great&#41; I did a drill &#40;2 up, 1 down&#41; got a Great, then did the venture.  When I got Crystal Eggs that restored my Oh-Gi-Yo to full energy &#40;but none that relieved stress&#41;... I found that it was going to be a failure week the next week. So getting the refreshed eggs wouldn&#39;t help me much &#40;I reset many times&#41;  I kept trying &#39;till I got 10&#43; stat gain and Stress relieving crystals.  I rested the next week to find that my Oh-Gi-Yo had grown up and gained Sore Loser &#40;don&#39;t want that&#41; so I reset.  Next venture, I got both Refreshed and Stress relieved &#40;also about 10 statgain but not quite&#41; so since my monster was at full energy... I decided to do a simple life drill &#40;thinking it would be a failure&#41; there just didnt seem to be a point in resting since with Iron Heart and the.. &#40;umm.. Holy Goblet?&#41;  I just decided to train anyways deciding I would encourage Oh-gi to &#34;Keep At It&#34;... But I got a Success? Umm... That was unexpected.  Maybe those horrible &#34;Failure Weeks&#34; are linked to the ammount of stress your monster has... Then again maybe it wasnt a &#34;failure week&#34; at all.  Maybe it was just that my monster was so stressed from all the training that it just couldnt succeed without the stress being relieved.  Now I doubt that the &#34;Failure Weeks&#34; are linked to this completely... But what I will suggest is that maybe SOME of the &#34;Failure Weeks&#34; are caused because of stress and not because your monster is destined to fail on that week. <BR> <BR>Dunno how well anyone can test this but I&#39;m still trying to train all the different monsters.  My favorites so far have been my Coltan, Izuna and Ogyo.  &#40;I hated my Plant so very much &#62;&#60;&#41; <BR> <BR>Well.. I&#39;ll be posting on this site now once in a while.  I&#39;m not doing any actual &#34;testing&#34; to any of my findings &#40;well maybe I might on odd occasions&#41;  but if anyone else wants to try and find out... <BR> <BR>K, nuff for now. :&#41;

 BraMan, another thing i am finding, from doing some resetting re: failure weeks, is that there are 2 kinds of failures, that the monsters have 2 different reactions to - with one, the monster is going to fail no matter what that week, but with the other, if you try an easier drill, or a different region, you can often get a success.  it could be that the first type of failure is hardwired into the game to pop up at random intervals, while the second is entirely stress-related.

 Which animation is tied to which Torey? <BR> <BR>Forexample: the Pixie&#39;s 2 failure animations.. <BR> <BR>1&#41; kneeling down on the ground as if upset like they didn&#39;t want to do the drill.. <BR>2&#41; keeled over at the waist, as if too fatigued to carry on any longer. <BR> <BR>SO, basically i am asking is it tied to the &#34;rebellious&#34; animation or the &#34;exauhsted&#34; animation?

 Also, do Greats give the monster more stress? I have found after getting two greats in a row my monster had a higher rate of failure.  Also,it would lose more points in the &#34;two  up one down drills &#34;, which made me wonder if stat decrease affects any stress.

 interesting idea, slapshot - i hadnt noticed that, but i wasnt looking for it either.   <BR> <BR>fenrick, i just raised a farn and i recall the two animations as 1&#93; standing straight up and kind of holding her head in the air and 2&#93; the keeled over at the waist one.  the keeled over at the waist one cannot be remedied; the other one can.

 i looked  into this more and i found that if i rested to lose stress, i could do about 3-4 light drills without aquiring stress or tiredness. <BR>I then rested again,and did 3-4 hard drills in a row, and found that i would become stressed out and tired&#40;we all know hard drills cause more tiredness though. <BR> <BR>i then did this for 3 months each, one for light drills, and one forhard  drills. i rested each time i had any tiredness and reset for any greats, and at  the end of the 3 months, i had no stress.  after, the 3 months doing the hard drills keeping the constants and variables the same, i had a message of very stressed out. <BR> <BR>this proves, as torey suggested the hard driulls give more stress than light drills. <BR>I am not sure how the greats affect stress however.

 This is probably not true, but I think that Greats give your monster 2x more than your current drill. Just like, if you do a LD and get a great, your fatigue goes down by 2. Just to make it understandable, say your monster was gonna do a LD on POW. If he got a Success then say it took 1 stress and 1 Fatigue. As if he did a Great, then it would be 2 stress and 2 fatigue.  <BR> <BR>And now, if you were to do a HD then say that it takes 2 Stress and 2 fatigue. And if you had a Great doing one, then guess what..... yup DOUBLED. That would be a bunch of Stress and Fatigue taken. This might not be true, but when I get a Great on a HD and my monster was at &#34;Is full of energy&#34; it goes down to around &#34;seems healthy&#34;. <BR> <BR>Also, it might not be doubled when your monster gets a great. I think it might actually be just &#43;1 if you get a great on Stress and Fatigue. This is just my theory, and might get around to testing it.

 slapshot and i were talking about another complicating factor last night - prime.  it is well known that monsters fail less, and get more greats, in prime, than any other stage of life.  in this context, i am using prime to mean that span where statgain is greatest, not necessarily the time between 2d and 3d growth. <BR> <BR>now, let&#39;s assume the &#34;greats add some stress&#34; theory is true, for the time being anyway.  that would mean mr3 is different in how it treats stress than mr2.  in mr2, stress had the same bad result whenever it occurred - it boosted the L.I., which eventually resulted in lifespan loss.  however, if, in mr3, in addition to any lifespan loss, stress inhibits greats and promotes failures &#91;which was never proven to be true in mr2&#93;, that means that being in prime either lessens stress, or strengthens the monsters ability to succeed/do great despite the existence of stress. <BR> <BR>so any testing of the effects of stress will have to be done in all stages of life - including prime.

 possibly, added stress varies depending on what you say when your monster performs a great? <BR>maybe?

 It seems everyone is neglecting the fact that after your monster gets a great you get a chance to speak to it. I would assume that that would affect the monster&#39;s stress level. When Spinach gets a great, and i say &#34;Great job&#34; Fleria tells me that Spinach is happy. I would assume that is Spinach were happy as a result of the great, that it woul not be gaining stress.

 i think there are two attributes involved in praise - happiness and confidence. <BR> <BR>i am guessing &#91;with nothing to back it up&#93; that a good balance must be maintained between those 2 things as well, like so many other 2 attribute things in mr games.

 You know, Praise isn&#39;t always the best thing. i.e: When you feed your monster a food item at the begining of the month and lets say that the nutritional value and favorite value was 4 F, 1 N. Now Fleria says that the monster is happy but was that the best choice. <BR> <BR>What I&#39;m getting at is, that constant praise can lead to stress. It might not be neccesaraly true, but I think that evening it out between Praise and Scold would maintain the best way to keep your monster getting good successes on drills. And reducing possible Life Loss.

 I thought I&#39;d throw this in here. What about when you punish a monster for a failure? I&#39;ve noticed five different responses for this, &#40;one being the &#34;Terrible&#34; option that shows up every now and then&#41; and was wondering what type of effect they would have on stress?
