 I was training Pundora, my color pandora... I save often at least every month... anyways, I realized it only had a month to live after I beat one of the big 5 tourneys and the monster died... :&#40; So i loaded the game and tried again... what!?  It died after only 3 weeks instead of 4...?  I&#39;ll go into more detail here: <BR>With Max Life Power Speed. <BR> <BR>First week: Hard Training... <BR>Second week: Hard Training... <BR>Third Week: Rest <BR>Fourth Week: Battle <BR> <BR>But what happened when it actually lived long enough to fight in the battle was: <BR> <BR>First week: Hard Training... <BR>Second week: Hard Training... Wait.  Monster wants to rest, will you let it rest?  &#40;I picked yes, the monster rested.&#41; <BR>Third week: Hard Training &#40;because it rested second week&#41; GREAT!!  Great Job. <BR>Fourth Week: still alive! <BR> <BR>I tested this a few times.  When it didnt ask to rest, it died after 3 weeks.  When it asked to rest and I let it rest, it lived an extra week. <BR>And I did this several times with the same result. <BR> <BR>My Pundora was from the Brillia subtype and had the 3 accessories, color&#39;s pan&#39;s and dora&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Umm... That may have been confusing but what I&#39;m suggesting is that when you choose Raise and the monster asks you to rest... maybe its lifespan doesnt go down if you let it rest?  Because you did not complete the training, nor did you choose rest.  If someone would test this and find out... I think this could be something very important that could potentially allow monsters to live very long lives! <BR> <BR>&#40;Happened a while ago but I couldnt post before&#41;

 Yes, I&#39;m sure.  It lived until the end of the month when it got the great and asked to rest.  But it only lived 3 days when it didnt rest. <BR>When I rested it on that day but it did not ask to rest, it only lived 3 days. <BR>So I think it is because the monster asked to rest... The training was not completed and the option Rest was not selected. It&#39;s quite possible that through some loophole there was no drop in lifespan. <BR>However, if you can think of any other possibilities, please reply with them.  If someone would actually take the time to test this that would be great. <BR> <BR>Haven&#39;t posted in a while. Warcraft III is out! Yay!  &#40;But my new comp is broken &#62;_&#60;&#41;  Well I need to reinstall the OS but files corrupted and... ah nvm... that&#39;s unrelated stuff. <BR> <BR>BraMan
