 I&#39;ve got a serious question for &#34;TheD&#34;.  When you started raising this monster, the only characteristic listed is &#34;Combative&#34;.  At 1 year old, you&#39;ve got : Magic Wisdom, Water Secrets, Heart Secrets .  I first of all want to know how that happened.  You typically get wisdoms first and they evolve to secrets at the growth period.  But you lost Combative and gained 2 secrets and a wisdom in one growth cycle &#40;you actually added the 2 secrets in the first 6 months&#41; and it doesn&#39;t seem you&#39;ve added a heart in that time frame based on your stat gains. <BR> <BR>Then, you go up to : Magic Wisdom, Water Secrets, Heart Secrets, Ltng. Wisdom, Confident, Aquaphobic, Sweet Smell, Snoring.  by adding a heart.  The heart here was obviously not that great since it didn&#39;t max a tech and only added sweet smell, snoring, Aquaphobic, Confident and Ltng Wisdom. <BR> <BR>Can you explain how that happened?  I&#39;d like to know how to add two secrets and a wisdom in 1 year.

 now i wish i had kept serial saves of some of my no-heart dmm monsters.  i am operating from memory only, which is potentially unreliable. <BR> <BR>that being said, i am almost certain that my dmm monsters have acquired secrets directly from ventures in their first year - prior to any growth period. <BR> <BR>what is other ranchers&#39; experience, memory, or &#91;gasp&#93; even saved evidence on this question one way or the other?

<I>I will state not in defence of anyone in particular, but that when raising Minmei... now.. keep in mind I have only raise with the DMM method on 2 monsters... I will post, as well as memory can serve, my experience with getting Chars. while DMMing.</I> <BR> <BR>1&#41; I Did get 3 Secrets &#40;in Morx.. go figure.. my bad luck spot&#41; <B>3 consecutive weeks in a row</B>. &#40;3 consecutive Adventure weeks of course DMMing&#41; <BR> <BR>2&#41; I am certain that these 3 Secrets were attained within the first year, or 2nd year of life.. in my experience DMMing, &#40;the 2 times i have done it&#41;, it seemed that my chances were actually BETTER to get char. giving creatures during infancy. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Of my 2 DMM monsters, i have never gotten a &#34;Wisdom&#34; to change into a &#34;Secret&#34; during a growth spurt. <BR> <BR>4&#41; Unfortunately.. i do not have a Year by Year save progress on minmei.. as she was not an experiment so i did not feel the need to save on multiple saves.

 Ok, Campster, All of the first year from 0y0m, to 1year old, I was raising him as a first Gen. I found Water Secrets, Heart Secrets and Magic Wisdom, amazingly. Then I decided to use Flo&#39;s heart to make it easier raising, and Flo gave me the rest of my Chars.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve never seen a Wisdom Evolve into a Secret, but I have upgraded from wisdom to secret by finding that type of wisdom as a secret, and the wisdom type goes away and the secret type takes its place. <BR> <BR>BTW, I have Water, Flame, Wind, Heart Secrets on my Lesi, plus Iron heart, and Hard Scales at 1y6m, and only 3 of those chars got passed on by his first Generation. <BR> <BR>Its really not that hard to find good chars if you really want to, thats why I have&#39;nt maxxed out my lesi&#39;s chars yet because I&#39;m making a Perfect monster. It is totally possible to find 3 Secrets in you first Growth, within a year.

 I mean it&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t played this game for hours on end...I couldn&#39;t tell you how many hours played in research/hacking and just fun.  Remember I&#39;ve maxed 4/nearly 5 monsters &#40;remembering I was the first&#41;.  I&#39;ve played this stupid thing for hundreds upon hundreds of hours.  I&#39;ve got multiple games past year 1100.   <BR> <BR>The only thing I can think of is, I typically don&#39;t let my dummy monsters venture.  I pass on the same hearts over and over and perhaps once the techs are maxed you get characteristic giving critters less often....I was just going thru the different posts here trying to decide if I&#39;ll enter online tourneys more and said, &#34;What&#34; when I read that remarkable turn of envents. <BR> <BR>As I stated in a different post, my typical way of building monster characteristics is to hurriedly raise to or three with the characteristics I want as their starting lines and then pass on that heart to my real guy...haven&#39;t done that since I&#39;ve been maxing...instead I just pass down the previous maxed heart so I can max techs easier. <BR> <BR>Me thinks I should rethink a few things.

 When i was DMMing Spinach, without a heart... well thise is a list of all the chars i ran into in its lifetime. I found all of these chars on ventures. Nearly everytime i found these, i reset.  <BR> <BR>Fast Footwork- 2 times <BR>Nearsighted- 3 times <BR>Stinky Feet- 6 times <BR>Vegitarian- 9 times <BR>Heart Wisdom- 5 times <BR>Migraine- 6 times <BR>Eats Anything- 6 times <BR>Dimples- 3 times <BR>Sweet Smell- 2 times <BR>Life Secrets- 1 time &#40;kept&#41; <BR>Ltng. Wisdom- 4 times <BR>Lump- 1 time <BR>Heart Secrets- 1 time <BR>Flame Secrets- 1 time &#40;kept&#41; <BR>Sharp Ears- 2 times  <BR>Wind Secrets- 3 times <BR>Cold- 1 time <BR>Water Wisdom- 3 times <BR>Sharp Eyes- 1 time &#40;kept&#41; <BR>Iron Heart- 4 times <BR>Magic Secrets- 1 time <BR>Sweaty- 1 time <BR>Sleepless- 1 time <BR>Directionless- 1 time <BR>Arthritis- 2 times <BR>Water Secrets- 1 time <BR>Hypotension- 1 time <BR>Snoring- 2 times <BR>Stuffy Nose- 1 time <BR> <BR>&#40;yes, i actually kept track&#41; What&#39;s my point? When you DMM, you come across A LOT of chars, most bad. Well because i DMM&#39;ed so methodically i likely ran into more chars than others do. But i managed to max Spinach by 3yrs 1mo without a heart, so it felt worth it to me. What i am getting at, is that the sheer fact that when DMMing i redo venture after venture, running into aromacargo or night scorpions is pretty much unavoidable. DMMing is a good way to pick and choose your chars.

 thanx, bubblefusion!  i know that we&#91;tb/sf, db, the d and myself&#93; had talked among ourselves extensively about the lore/secrets/wisdom area of chars in chat.  i was pretty sure that, among ourselves, we had decided that lore was the generic term for secrets and/or wisdom, rather than a separate category.  we had similarly decided that it was not a &#34;first one, then the next&#34; kind of thing, but that, on any given venture, one was as likely to find secrets as wisdom &#91;or vice versa&#93;.   <BR> <BR>so when i saw your post, campster, my defensiveness was not based on any accusatory tone i read into your post...it was based on my realization that &#34;oops - we found this stuff out and never systematically posted it&#34; <BR> <BR>but now, thanx to your question and tigershadow&#39;s answer, we have!  its all good.

 Well here&#39;s the idendum.  Started raising my next big thing last night.  18 weeks of ventures with only 12 resets for a total of 30 weeks on ventures with new DMM monsters.  No hearts passed down. <BR> <BR>No tech training yet....only regular light of earth spots....only 1 critter giving me a lump. <BR> <BR>I repeat...How the hell the good luck?  Figured I&#39;d change the timeframe when I give the heart just to verify that isn&#39;t it...nope. <BR> <BR>If we look at the life of Spinach, there were 75 critters found.  I must be in for a run or something.  Don&#39;t get me wrong..I&#39;ve found critters on ventures before that gave wisdom or secrets...it happens and you can acquire them thru hearts and such but I mean wow.  75 critters during the life of one monster and I can&#39;t get but 1 in 30 weeks....there has got to be a reason. <BR> <BR>Plus if you look at Spinach he got 5 secrets and 12 wisdoms...that was a 6% and 15% rate of return.  Granted this is just a sampling, but that&#39;s a hell of a lot of luck to get 2 secrets in 6 months....I&#39;m talking a ton of resets.  Tons. <BR> <BR>The law of averages established by Shadow Fusions numbers &#40;granted they aren&#39;t law or anything&#41; says you would&#39;ve had to run into 33ish critters to get 2 secrets.  I went 30 ventures only getting 1.  So either I&#39;m doing something or there is some undiscovered/revealed research into what makes getting a critter easier.

 You are right Campster, it does take a lot of resets....alot. But raising a first gen and Maxxing him by 3y1m, did take alot of resets to make it perfect, so getting a refreshment every venture, and no rests. And there is a bit of Luck involved I guess.

 Should have more time to continue this weekend but answer this...typically for you, how many ventures between critters &#40;shelleys, aromaescargo, etc&#41;.  1-5, 1-10, 1-20...throw out a guess. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m gonna do a little mindnumbing research tonight designed to just try and find critter patterns if there is one...no playing for fun.

 TheD, when I first did this back in March with the first of the Maxs, Reilly, I had people at the other board saying I was crazy for resetting an average of 4 to 5 times per venture and only training normally for about 6 months in the first year &#40;though she did start with a weak heart&#41;.  I was counting thru your time between beginning and finishing.  You started August 9th and finished September 1st.  That&#39;s almost a month. <BR> <BR>When Maxing my Reilly, I started before Feb. 24th and finished Mar. 3rd.  That&#39;s about 8-9 days and about 30-40 hours.  I&#39;m only guessing but how many times per venture are you resetting if it took you about 18 days longer?

 any more organized insight into attaining chars would be welcome. <BR> <BR>i admit that the others are ahead of me on the development of useful chars.  i tend to try to get thru &#34;earth day&#34; as quickly as possible without resetting any more than absolutely necessary.  as a consequence, my monsters tend not to have as many useful chars as tb/sf&#39;s, db&#39;s or d&#39;s. <BR> <BR>but as far as chars &#34;in gross&#34;, that is, taking the good and bad together, they are always there for the getting, in my experience.  whenever i dmm a heartless monster for lisa&#39;s tourneys, if i were to take every char i got, including bad ones like &#34;migraine&#34; or &#34;nearsighted&#34;, my char table would be full by 6-8 months every time.  even kicking out the bad ones, but keeping neutral ones &#91;like &#34;heart secrets&#34; where my monster has no heart techs&#93; i am always full by the time of first growth. <BR> <BR>to make a long post even longer by summing up, in my experience chars are there for the taking when you dmm a monster, and the only question is going to be how picky you are in which ones to keep.

 Campster, i often spent around 45min on each venture. a few ventures were great, only took me like 15 min. On many ventures i spent well over an hour. On a few very, VERY stressful ventures i spent about 3 hours... God that makes me cringe when i think about it. I think the only time i refused to redo a venture over 3 times was when my monster was having a growth spert. I just couldn&#39;t stand to sit through that animation over and over.

 Initial research....I think I&#39;ve found a pattern. <BR> <BR>I need someone else to check this but on my game,I think I found a pattern.  I&#39;ve been experiencing the same benefit that the other guys were reporting...I got it by just venturing and resetting in each locale 10 times and finding items and critters in only one locale per week.  In the locale where the critters may show there are other scenarios...The most prevelant scenario is battling the same monster twice on the same venture. <BR> <BR>The pattern on my game is: <BR> <BR>Locales rotate every month in order of the map.  Morx, Goat, Takrama, Kalaragi, Brillia.  There&#39;s about a 25% chance of finding a critter or unique accessory.  By following this pattern I found 9 critters and both Joker accessories in 3 years.  Here goes yr stands for Year ending in &#40;0=1020, 1030, 1040 etc&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Yr----Morx----Bril----Kal----Tak----Goat <BR>0-----Nov-----Aug-----May----Feb---Zip <BR>1-----Zip-----Nov-----Aug----May---Feb <BR>2-----Feb-----Zip-----Nov----Aug---May <BR>3-----May-----Feb-----Zip----Nov---Aug <BR>4-----Aug-----May-----Feb----Zip---Nov <BR>5-----Nov-----Aug-----May----Feb---Zip <BR>6-----Zip-----Nov-----Aug----May---Feb <BR>7-----Feb-----Zip-----Nov----Aug---May <BR>8-----May-----Feb-----Zip----Nov---Aug <BR>9-----Aug-----May-----Feb----Zip---Nov <BR> <BR>Torey or Fen or anyone else could you give this a try and see if you can drill with a new DMM monster and Venture in these locales on these months in years ending in the associated number and see if you can easily get a critter in just 3 to 5 ventures...You know you&#39;re at the right week and will need to reset if you get into 2 battles on the same venture...I experienced this 4 times and always got a critter within a couple of resets or a Joker item. <BR> <BR>My Joker was able to acquire the 2 desired secrets this way in not a ton of tries.  If this is right, than this is huge.

 lately i&#39;ve been all out just to get a month or two into my lesi every now and then.  i have had the two battles pattern several times in his first few months of life.  because he has a heart, he ko&#39;s the E level enemies easily, and his battle sense is jumping much quicker than normal.  therefore, i have been accepting the two battles part of the pattern, and not resetting to look for chars.   <BR> <BR>so the best i can promise is that, within the next three weeks, there will come some ventures when i can test this pattern.  i will tell you that, from looking at it, and from vague memories, it seems to accurately state what can occur at venture - to me, anyway. <BR> <BR>here&#39;s the other thing i can do for you.  i can inform you, and the world, that most of the advances in mr3 knowledge are coming from deadbuffalo, tigerbubble, the d, and slapshots.  you might have noticed their monsters in the most recent tournaments.  by expanding your request to recognize the best trainers by name, maybe we can motivate them to go out of their way to check out your findings.

 Sorry I hav&#39;nt been here for a while, but catching up on whats been going on, Campster, I think that I maxxed Mickey Fast. Flo took me about a month and 4 days but he was a first Gen. Maxxing a Monster in 8-9 Days?!? Thats great. I wish I could put that much time into it, but I either loose my nerve or school gets in the way. <BR> <BR>That is nice research, and I would actually like to test it, if I get around to it, also like torey, during the life of my Lesione. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;ll be enough, because I&#39;m almost done with her. &#40;2y2m&#41; I&#39;ll see what I can do in this field, and if I can pick my last char using this theory. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;m like around year 1167, so give me some time to get this pattern in my head and I think I can actually try it.

 A small update.  It looks like there is a second locale that can yield a critter too.  Seems like the first chart I posted will almost always yield a battle characteristic critter. <BR> <BR>But there&#39;s more.  the other critter seems to lag 2 locales behind.  So in the chart above if it says Nov Morx, you can get a battle characteristic <BR> <BR>Fire Secrets, Fast Footwork, Sharp Eyes, Weak .vs Magic etc...  But 2 locales behind in Kalaragi you could also run into a critter giving a personality/raising &#40;or visible&#41; trait.  Vegetarian, Easily Tired, Lump, Bruise etc... <BR> <BR>I will not at this point say this research is definate...here&#39;s why. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve put about 8 hours into it...and didn&#39;t discover the second pattern till about 5 hours in. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t gotten anything other than a battle characteristic in the first grouping and that includes 24 characteristics in 102 ventures &#40;once the pattern was recognized&#41;.  I haven&#39;t gotten a battle Characteristic in the visible trait grouping of 10 characteristics in 26 tries. <BR> <BR>Now here is my concern.  That these dates are dependent on something &#40;perhaps game unique&#41;...Like order you opened the locales...or when the monster that you&#39;re using was born or something...So TheD if you&#39;ll look at this, try duplicating this on your game.  Same Dates as mine..If the first chart works, try the same thing but move backward 2 locales and also tell me if you get either types of characteristics in the wrong location. <BR> <BR>Lastly try to keep a list of how successful you are/aren&#39;t.  I&#39;m at about 25% in the Battle characteristics area and 40% in the Visible traits Characteristic area

Ok, I think I will try this, but I&#39;m a bit confused on the chart. Not that you did&#39;nt explain it good, I&#39;m just confused. For example, using the chart info, if I search in Morx on the 116<B>7</B> in Feb, I will find a char, after a certain amount of resets? But if I search in Morx during year 116<B>6</B>, I will find none? I hav&#39;nt really looked at this &#40;or noticed&#41; if locales are rotating, what you are saying.  <BR> <BR>Well, I&#39;m thinking that Zip means NOTHING as in no Char that venture, but it can mean, that Morx is&#39;nt there that year. I&#39;m sorry for the confusion Campster, but I think you might have something here, and I&#39;d really like to get it clear and try it.

 Since there are only 4 search opportunities per year, one locale &#40;5 0f them&#41; is left out every year...Zip means no opportunities for the characteristic search that year in that locale. <BR> <BR>Was the thing about the two different versions of characteristics clear. <BR> <BR>That the chart above listed gave mostly battle type characteristics and that the other characteristis showed up for me 2 weeks off?

 Sorry, that&#39;s 2 locales off &#40;not weeks&#41;.  Meaning that if in year &#39;7, month Feb you are in Takrama instead of Morx &#40;where the battle characteristics would show up for me&#41; you would get the personality/visible trait.  So try whatever my chart says...and then move 2 locales ahead and try there too.

 Ok, so I think I get it now, except one more thing, so if I search in Morx, at whatever time your chart has up, I venture until I find a Char, Come back the next year, now a different locale but same date as last year, I should find another char. Is this what the experiment is about? I hope I got it down, cause I&#39;ll gladly do that. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry for all the confusion on this, but hey I&#39;m only in 10th Grade, you can&#39;t blame me =P

 Actually TheD, the location rotates quarterly.  So if in morx in Feb and find the characteristic, move your search to Goat in May then to Takrama in Aug and Kalaragi in Nov then when in Feb the next year you&#39;re up to Brillia then back to Morx now one quarter year off in May &#40;as opposed to the previous year in Feb for morx&#41;

 I get it now, but the actual research is to see if, lets say in Morx during one year, you find a Battle Char, and next year, it rotates to lets say Goat, if I find another Battle Char I&#39;m successful to your theory? I hope I got it down right this time.

 Well, yes but it rotates quarterly.  There&#39;s 5 locales and only 4 months.  That&#39;s why it moves next year...cuz there&#39;s an extra locale.  Try it by rotating locations every venture just like the chart says.  If you started in Morx in a 7 year month of Feb and reset till you get a characteristic...if you get one in 5 to 10 tries &#40;should be less than 5&#41; continue on till May and move to Goat and venture there....give it 5 to 10 tries till you get one...&#40;once again should be less than 5 tries&#41; save and move on to August and move to Takrama and so one...move quarterly like the chart says...by next May &#40;year ending in 8&#41; you&#39;ll be back at morx like the chart says.

 If I&#39;m not explaining it well, just let me know.  Because I&#39;ve been researching it, the chart is plain to me but it may not be to others....A little help here either explaining it to others or asking me to explain it better.  But as another example of how the chart works &#40;without the word zip.  This is the location you should check each venture. <BR> <BR>year 0 <BR>Feb - Tak <BR>May - Kalaragi <BR>Aug - Brillia <BR>Nov - Morx <BR> <BR>Year 1 <BR>Feb - Goat <BR>May - Tak <BR>Aug - Kalaragi <BR>Nov - Brillia <BR> <BR>Year 2 <BR>Feb - Morx <BR> <BR>and so on.  Keep following the rotation from here.

 YAY! I get it now, and what were trying to find out. Let me just finish off my Lesi, give me the rest of this week to do Lesi, and I&#39;ll start on this.  <BR> <BR>BTW, if this works, well, thats a great thing then. That&#39;ll give me an advantage in getting chars for my BEWD for S class. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll keep track of how many times it takes me each venture, what I find, etc. I&#39;ll keep you posted. <BR> <BR>Also, you were&#39;nt explaining it wrong or bad, its just that my brain needs to catch on to things like this sometimes. =P
