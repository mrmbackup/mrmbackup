I found out two very interesting things today with respect to monster evolution. <BR> <BR>First, if you&#39;ve been feeding your monster a localizing food, but don&#39;t want it to evolve, take it to another area for its &#34;growing up&#34; phase. I had a dragon/? today that had been fed 6 mushrooms, and each time I let the evolution happen in Morx, he evolved into a /Morx. Whenever I moved him to grow up in another area &#40;I tried all 4&#41;, he did not change from /?. <B>So, if you want to feed your monster localizing foods because of their preference/nutrition, you can feel free as long as you move your monster out of the region during its growth spurt.</B> <BR> <BR>Second, evolution is not a hit or miss proposition. The same dragon, for its second growth spurt &#40;it was now a dragon/morx&#41;, had been fed localizing food in Goat. I fed him 6 shellfish over 11 months. When he didn&#39;t evolve, I was surprised, but not dismayed--after all, this has happened to me before with a Gitan. I&#39;ve gotten into the habit, though, of replaying the growth spurt multiple times to achieve the best combination of altered characteristics and dispositions. As I was replaying the growth for the third time, I decided to rest him into his growth instead of training, as I had been doing because that&#39;s what his training cycle called for. Suddenly, he evolved into a /Goat. My first thought was that the rest had triggered the evolution, but as I repeated the growth additional times, I discovered that he could evolve off of either a train or a rest, and that the odds across about 30 replays were very close to 50%. <B>So, evolution is not a 100% determined process. There is some randomness involved. If your monster hasn&#39;t evolved when you think it should, or if it evolves when you think it shouldn&#39;t, try reloading. It may change the outcome.</B> <BR> <BR><B>Added info by Lisa Shock:</B> <BR>I was raising a dummy monster for my Battle Sense experiment, and had been checking various foods with it for yet another project. &#40;Trying to get two projects done together.&#41; Anyway, I had a Zan/Morx, and raised it only in Takrama. It was sent to hibernate for the week before each venture, while my other monster was out &amp; venturing. The Zan was frozen a total of 5 times, and only lived in Takrama, and it evolved into the Takrama sub at the first growth spurt. So, going to town, and hibernating do not affect evolution.
