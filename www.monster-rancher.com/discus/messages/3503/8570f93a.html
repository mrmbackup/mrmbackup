 Heres the deal, I myself dont have a lot of time on my hands to test this out completly, but I thought I&#39;d post what I&#39;ve seen anyway, so that someone who does have the time can follow up on it. <BR> <BR>Playing MR3 and going thru a couple monsters in the last couple days, I&#39;ve been piddling around with the ventures. <BR> <BR>In Morx, it seems that when I choose the Ran Ran extract, I get into alot of battles all over the area and very seldom find any bits/fragments, but when I choose the Fruit, I seem to be able to find an bit/fragment at the &#34;bad feeling&#34; spots quite often, yet very seldom get into a random battle. <BR> <BR>In Takrama, selecting the Fruit again also allowed me to find bits and fragments, yet no battles &#40;found 2 bits in one venture&#41;, and when i selected the Leaf, i got into a battle that i won a orb from.  I messed up and had to reload, and when I ventured again that same month, I chose Leaf again, and again got an orb battle. <BR> <BR>This could just be coincidence, however, it could also be a possible way to figgure out how to get items/orbs you need, without having to reload very often. <BR> <BR>Sorry if this post should go somewhere else, but I couldn&#39;t find a related post. <BR> <BR>Sartugha

 Interesting find, however, from my experiance DMMing &#40;see methods section&#41;, using only Ran Ran extract, i have seen bad feeling spots give bits, sometimes twice in one venture &#40;i only check &#39;em though if i have spare ran ran left and have visited every other light of earth&#41;, battles w/orbs, or just battles. Part of the reason DMM is succesful is because the venture results are random. Were they not, people would reset for months and still get the same results. This also applies for people who reset for orbs. <BR> <BR>Pretty much, from the evidence you&#39;ve provided, or rather lack of, and my contradicting own experiances, I&#39;d say that it would not be prudent to follow up on this topic. <BR> <BR>If you can get the leaf to give you an orb 4 out of 5 times, i&#39;d say you&#39;re on to something.  <BR> <BR>On a positive note, it is good that you post observations like this. You may be pointing out something we don&#39;t know. I can only request that even if you don&#39;t have the time to thouroughly test something, test it enough so that there is proof that a more in depth analysis would be worthwhile. And sometimes, the best way to get something done is to do it yourself.

 I have an idea of what Sartugha is talking about, from early on before i began DMMing. I used to suspect the same thing. But than i started DMMing, and you wouldn&#39;t believe how often i get bad feeling spots. Of course i rarely if ever actually search those spots &#40;intentionally&#41;. I have often found 2 bad feeling spots in a venture, a few times even 3, and once i found 4 bad feeling spots. I remember this, because of how much i hate finding bad feeling spots, because of all the times i accidently searched them and wasted a lot of ran ran &#40;and time&#41;. When i DMM i sometimes drift off into space and miss the que where Fleria asks if i am sure i want to search the place. Oh well... <BR> <BR>But my point is, that i am pretty certain that it is coincidence. When i venture in say, Goat, there are three spots that render bad feeling messages more often than any other spots. It could be that when you are venturing with a ran ran leaf, you are heading straight to those spots.
