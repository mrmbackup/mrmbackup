Lesiones are monsters that have some very attractive techs. Between submerge, showtime, tsunami, you have 3 techs that can do some major damage and have pretty good accuracy. The key here though, as with all monsters, is guts regain. While 90 guts regain isn&#39;t as slow as molasses, it definitely cannot recover the loss of 50 guts so fast. I don&#39;t really see much of a possibility for only int based Lesiones, but pow and pow&#43;int based ones will do fine. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff9900">Tail Whip</FONT>: Tail Whip is a solid rational/BLS tech. At 23 guts, you get a relatively accurate &#40;50&#41; tech that does 27 damage when maxed. This is a tech reminiscent of the heavily praised Remote Punch &#40;see Henger guide&#41;, with the extra 2 guts cost made up for by the faster guts regain. Little techs like Tail Whip allow for monsters to recover from a massive guts lost; either by the enemy&#39;s tech or if the monster misses one of its own more exspensive <BR>techs. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Tsunami</FONT>: Speaking of exspensive techs, Tsunami costs 50 guts but is Lesione&#39;s strongest attack at 57 damage and a respectable 50 accuracy. This is a vacuum tech that can be risky due to Lesione&#39;s slower guts regain. But it is the only Lesione tech that really hits the upper tier of damage, and for this reason, I don&#39;t think it can be ignored. At the Lesione Mayor&#39;s Cup though, I found it to be more of a big splash than a big wave for my own Lesione. Then again, i&#39;m sure Torey found it to be the exact opposite. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff9900">Submerge</FONT>: The tech that makes Lesiones something to be feared. Submerge doesn&#39;t do gutsdown, it doesn&#39;t do critical, it does damage. Cheap &#40;36 guts&#41;, high &#40;42 damage&#41;, and accurate &#40;55 accuracy&#41; damage. Its worth every minute you spend getting that jade orb for it. It is irrational not to use this tech, so I guess it can be considered rational. <BR> <BR>Alternatives- <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="119911">Lesihorne</FONT>: A tech that doesn&#39;t seem impressive at first simply because it doesn&#39;t do enough damage &#40;12&#41; for 20 guts. However, against slower regaining monsters &#40;lesiones, hengers, etc&#41;, the gutsdown &#40;28&#41; and formidable accuracy &#40;54&#41; can stop a monster from pulling off more exspensive techs while leaving enough guts on your lesione to pull off a submerge or tail whip. I&#39;d classify it as a risk tech still though, because against a faster regaining monster or one with a BLS techs, it won&#39;t be as effective. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff9900">Showtime</FONT>: A vacuum high risk tech. Decent damage &#40;40&#41;, high cost &#40;47&#41;, decent accuracy &#40;48&#41;, and massive gutsdown &#40;50&#41;. Its going to be good if your opponent has saved up all those guts, but otherwise, you&#39;d be better off with a submerge, as its cheaper and more damaging. Recommended because its always frustrating when Lahas hits you with it. <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Lesione tech guide contributed by DeadBuffalo.</FONT></FONT>
