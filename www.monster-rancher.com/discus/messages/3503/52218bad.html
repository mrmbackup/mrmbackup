 I started running my cds through the shrine, and they are making different monsters than they did in MF3. I guess the programmers had to alter the formula to accomdate the new breeds, and maybe they decided to give the US import crowd a bit of a new challenge!

 Actually, it appears that only the &#39;?&#39; sub has been altered. I still get the same main from my &#39;?&#39; cd/dvds, and most of the discs I have checked so far ARE the same as the Japanese version.

 Well, I got the Japanese version of the game, and played it a lot, and posted about my experiences. Then Tecmo asked for input for improvements for the game before it hit the US. I posted at Tecmo&#39;s board about a few things. Then they asked for suggestions for CDs/DVDs to make rares, and again I replied. Then, Eggo called me on the phone and asked me if I could type the posts up for presentation to Japan, since he was busy.  <BR> <BR>I typed up the lists, and sent them off. In the mean time, Eggo kept calling and asking questions about the Japanese game because I was so familiar with it. Essentially, I answered a lot of questions, and helped guide Tecmo US as they localized the game for North America. I wound up approving art for one of the US exclusive rare monsters before the programmers modelled it.  <BR> <BR>I also helped write the Prima strategy guide, because Eggo asked me to help them. That was two weeks of full-time work. I turned down an offer of money in exchange for a &#34;thanks to&#34; credit in the book. Unfortunately, Prima did not credit me. <BR> <BR>Occasionally, I still answer tough questions for the Tecmo game counselors. <BR> <BR>What I did discover through all of this is that Tecmo was willing to make huge additions and adjustments just for the US fans. They are very cool people, and happen to make great games too!

 Lisa, your story is very inspiring.  How does one go about making such contacts at Tecmo and becoming part of this process of design and marketing?

 All of the design is done in Japan, they really just offered the US a few rares, which were all created in Japan. And marketing is a real job position at the US office. &#40;Tiffany Stratton has had the job for a while.&#41; I never saw any advance copy on any ads.  <BR> <BR>Essentially, Eggo, the head of US PR, maintains a mailing list of anyone who has a MR site and wants to get the official press releases, you simply email him with the info. Occasionally, when they look for fan input, he will send out emails to webmasters. Each time that has happened, I have posted messages on MRM asking for input from everyone before I replied. <BR> <BR>Tecmo also occasionally posts messages on their message boards asking for input. Eggo will visit a few of the big boards and post an invite to post input at the Tecmo boards in those threads. When this all started, Eggo posted message threads at the Tecmo boards asking for input. Those people who chose to post at Tecmo&#39;s site all got a chance to directly affect the MR3 game.  <BR> <BR>Your best bet is to become a regular on Tecmo&#39;s boards, where employees read posts pretty regularly. &#40;Even though they don&#39;t reply very often.&#41; If they need input/help they tend to ask people who seem knowledgable, and responsible. &#40;Posting about having a Blue Phoenix that came straight off a CD, and with all 999s at birth, would be the sort of thing to make them distrust a person pretty much permanently...&#41; They are a notoriously tight-lipped group, so simple patience and a helpful attitude are the key. Also note that they all receive hundreds of emails every day from people wanting to do things with/for them. They tend to ignore generic email inquiries.

 Your story is amazing! I&#39;m curious as to how you came up with the ideas for Tigon, Fay, and Eega? Did you actually design the monsters? I have around 80&#43; drawings of original monsters that i like to pretend could actually some day be in a video game or anime/manga, but the chances of that a few and far between. I&#39;ve been writing my own manga story too, i hope to some day get it published, it isn&#39;t a story related to my monsters though. Oh man, i&#39;ve been blabbering on, sorry. anyway... <BR> <BR>Another question i have is whether the descriptions of each monster in the encyclopedia of the english verion of the game are simply translations of the Japanese version or did they rewrite them completely?

Tigon, Fay and Eega were chosen by Tecmo Japan from many, many suggestions posted at Tecmo&#39;s message boards. You can see that thread <A HREF="http://www.tecmoinc.com/ubb/Forum18/HTML/000012.html" TARGET="_blank">here</A>.  <BR> <BR>When I typed up desciptions, for all the monsters listed in that thread &#40;took 3 days to write&#41; I was asked to write as if writing for a person who had never seen the film or heard the music involved. So, Tigon was pretty easy &#34;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: A Dragon monster with stripes like a real life tiger from India, or a Tiger monster that looks like a Dragon.&#34; &#40;At least they were familiar with MR monsters, so I didn&#39;t have to describe normal parts of old favorites like Golems.&#41; <BR> <BR>Most other ideas took more time. The Pixies took the longest &amp; had to be described from head to foot: hair color, hair length &amp; style, makeup, clothing, jewelry, stockings, shoes, accessories. But, it was all done in written form. They sent the picture of Eega, to make certain it was right, mostly because the shrieking eels are on screen so briefly in The Princess Bride. Essentially, the people who make the character models in the game also make the preproduction sketches, it&#39;s the first phase of their jobs on the games. <BR> <BR>As for the descriptions, most are the same &#40;for monsters that are in both games&#41; with a little creative license tossed in. An outside company did the translations, Sophia Enterprises, with some input from the US office. &#40;Like at one point I was asked to tell them if anything stood out as possibly &#34;not right&#34; for straight translation. I pointed out that an opponent &#91;baku/morx&#93; in one level&#39;s tourneys was named &#34;Ur-in&#34;. They changed that.&#41;
