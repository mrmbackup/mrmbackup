 Ok, I&#39;ve been noticing this for a while, and it&#39;s been getting me mad at times.  <BR> <BR>Ok, so I&#39;ve raised a nice First Gen Hare for the Fast Footwork char, tried to put it on my Lesi, and what a suprise.....It did&#39;nt go on. So, I tried putting it on my Gitan, making it look even faster than ever, but whad&#39;ya know.... It did&#39;nt pick it up. So I figured, there are chars that are breed specific. I&#39;m not talking about the battle chars, such as the secrets and wisdoms, but like armor and thick fur. &#40;DB you should know what passes on to what with your DEF Chars&#41;. <BR> <BR>But my point, I think this would make an interesting post to see what passes on to what breed. So I just want to see what you guys think and if you&#39;d like to get this done. I have nothing really great to do but raise my BEWD, but it can wait for a while, because I&#39;d really like to get this up.

I&#39;ll confirm that from my def. char research, certain monsters are not capable of recieving certain characteristics &#40;from hearts&#41;. In my experiance, every monster can receive Armor from a heart, but the other def. chars vary from species to species &#40;hence why some monsters can get four, and others only 2&#41;. I suspect that this is true with other characteristics too.  <BR> <BR>I know that when I made Pokylyps, the heart I created for him used the Jell/Brilla, because Jell/Brilla starts off with the characteristic Sniper. Lisa had hyped up this char and had told me of a golem she had that had started with it. I was disappointed when I found out that the char did not pass on to Pokylyps. So it could be that certain characteristics won&#39;t pass down from a monster if they are specific to that breed &#40;as in EVERY monster of that specific breed will have that char&#41; <BR> <BR>I am unsure if Hare&#39;s fast footworks is one of these characteristics, and the only way to find out is to try it on every breed &#40; I guess you can stop trying after trying it on 28 different ones <FONT FACE="WINGDINGS">&#74;</FONT> &#41;

 I believe that Lorelock is working on a chart of these, any help you can give &#40;either in chat or here&#41; would help.

 Lorelock....never seen him. Well, if I see him in chat or anywhere, I&#39;ll see what he&#39;s doing now, it&#39;d help if he posted to this thread too. Well, I&#39;ll see what happens, and help out, cause I think this is a pretty interesting and helpfull topic when completed. It could save some time in creating a heart.
