 I haven&#39;t found this issue brought up yet, so i hope i&#39;m not posting and already discussed issue. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if i am legally aloud to quote the Strategy guide on this site, so i won&#39;t, and you may have to look it up yourself. <BR> <BR>In the Strategy Guide, on page 16 under the accessories explanaition, the guide seems to explain that accessories can be aquired during random battles on ventures. Is this true? It has yet to happen to me, but perhaps i simply haven&#39;t had a monster that was able to wear the accessory that the wild monster i beat had.  <BR> <BR>Any clearification would be great. Thanks

 Yes, it is possible to find accessories on searches. My Windine found a pair of antanae &#40;spelled wrong, I know&#41; and my Strawberry found Antlers &#40;two sticks. yay&#41;.

 Maybe i wasn&#39;t clear. What i am asking is if you can aquire an accessory through the battle you have with wild monsters while on a venture. I don&#39;t mean simply finding it through searching. I hope that is clearer, but thank you anyway Agmasamu for responding.

 Er...I should&#39;ve read it better. The only thing I&#39;ve found by winning fights is Orbs.

 The guide says that, because in the Japanese version of the game &#40;the only version they were given to play while writing the book&#41; if you defeated a monster that visited your ranch with one of your opponents &#40;like Gadamon, or Rip &amp; Rap&#41; and it had an accessory on, you could get that accessory.

 thats dissapointing. <BR> <BR>Lisa, do you know how accurate the Strategy Guide is on its explainations of the functions of accessories? According to it, Fancy Sheild raises deffence but lowers dodging ability for Hengars, but has no effect for Zans. Is this a mistake or can items have inconsistant effects in that they could have an particular effect for one breed, but have a different effect or no effect at all for another? <BR> <BR>Also: Hey everyone check out my limmerik in the poety section. Its not great or anything, but i&#39;m worried that few people will notice it all secluded from the bulk of the posts. Thanks

 I suspect that the &#34;-&#34; entries in the accessory charts mean that they were not told by Tecmo, not nothing. I could be wrong on this, but Tecmo doesn&#39;t like to tell the world exactly what items and accessories do, take a look at the items list for MR2 that&#39;s on the Tecmo website.

 On AgMasamu&#39;s point of &#34;i&#39;ve only found orbs,&#34; i have been ranching for well over 24 game years now, encounterd many a stray monster during ventures &#40;most of which WERE of class C or higher&#41;, KOed my share of them, and have still come up empty handed each and every time.  In short, mine eyes have yet to see an orb.  Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>thanx for your time

 In my 80&#43; years of ranching, I&#39;ve only seen one Orb while venturing with a monster below A rank. Probably because I only start looking when I hit A, but that&#39;s not the point ^_^ <BR> <BR>Anyway, the only monsters who can yield Orbs are those from &#34;bad feeling&#34; spots. There&#39;s a map at this site somewhere &#40;or over at M-R.com&#41; that shows where the spots are. Once you know where to search they should appear with some regularity. <BR> <BR>-Kevin

 Your monster must be A rank or higher and you must be trying the &#39;bad feeling&#39; spots. <BR> <BR>To get a Durahan, use a disc that makes one like Dead or Alive, Gallop Racer 2001 or Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout.
