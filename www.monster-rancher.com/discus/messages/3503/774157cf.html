 As I was raising a Joker of mine using my raising method, I noticed something a little odd, but if studied more throughly, it may provide the means to create a method that&#39;s non-dependent on the ventures for strees/fatigue relief. I had my Joker &#40;Juggalo&#41; out on Aug4,1221 of game time, and I went to do my method as normal. I fed him his &#34;likes a lot&#34; depelting item, which in this case is Black Pearls. As far as his training went, it was one of those weeks where he refused to do a hard drill, so I followed my method, and froze him until Nov4,1221.  <BR> <BR>When the said date rolled around, I brought Juggalo back out and rather absentmindedly fed him another Black Pearl. Now, from past experiences, whenever I&#39;ve tried to feed anything in this game more then one item, Fleria usually said my monster was full. Well, much to my suprise, with Juggalo here that was just not the case, as he proceeded to eat another Black Pearl. &#40;He went into his hibernation having already been fed one.&#41; <BR> <BR>So, I fed him another Black Pearl, and he ate the third one as well. Now, my question&#40;s&#41; are, One, has anyone else experienced this and, two, if so, is it only for monsters that like a particular item a lot? I think that this may only be for monsters that like something a lot, but until I get more playtime with Juggalo to thoroughly test this, I really can&#39;t 100% confirm what I&#39;ve posted.

 So uh, you CAN feed your monster more than one item. Is that what you&#39;re saying? No, I haven&#39;t experienced that.

 You can only give one CONSUMABLE item per week. You can give seemingly infinite non-consumable items. Black Pearls are not consumable. Why would you eat a Black Pearl? If you tried to do it with something like Diet Grass / Honey Candy, you would get the message.

 I have noticed this too, Corpse, when i was raising a dragon to maximize its life span. However despite repeatedly feeding my dragon black pearls, i didn&#39;t notice much more than a lot of money going down the tube. But i don&#39;t know how this would affect a monster on a training schedule, since i was only resting my dragon and not training it. It may be something greatly useful or something that is just an efficent way to spend money.

 I usually use BP&#39;s when I start to notice that my monsters are starting to fail more than normal. This is usually caused by stress, and it&#39;s been proven &#40;By Eagle Fierce&#41; that BP&#39;s reduce stress a nice chunk. So it is a good thing to do every once in a while.

 i am not sure that the level of &#34;proof&#34; has been reached.  that being said, though, i use black pearls to reduce stress and usually they seem to do so.

 I&#39;ve decided, in my &#34;observational research&#34;, that to be able to feed multiples of consumables to a monster, they must &#34;like it a lot&#34;. However, as far as the BP&#39;s go, I was hoping that they would reduce some amount of fatigue, but after feeding 30 of them to my Joker, when he was &#34;feeling a little tired&#34;, that was not the case.  <BR> <BR>Now, until I&#39;ve throughly tested this on multiple monster types, with multiple types of the consumable items, under multiple conditions,&#40;like being too stressed/fatigued, different season,etc...&#41; this all should be taken with a grain of salt, in case there&#39;s something I may have overlooked.

 I&#39;m not sure that Black pearls alone reduce stress.  I think it has to do with whether or not he likes it or not.  Try finding a monster that hates black pearls &#40;my joker did&#41; and try feeding feeding it to him 3 months in a row and see if you&#39;re stressed.

 I do notice a big difference. When my Tanuzo, Lemur, fails a few times I give him a BP and he usually gets a Great or at least doesn&#39;t fail again. I also like to give him one before battles as I think stress has some effect on battle performance.

 Recently, I decided to test out my theory on depleting items, to try to find out which ones can be fed more than once in a week, and to see what the benefits of doing so may be. I tested my Joker Juggalo, and a brand new Joker straight outta the encyclopedia. Both of the Jokers liked and hated exactly the same things.&#40;I&#39;ll explain why I did my tests this way later&#41; <BR> <BR>First, the following is a list of the depleting items that I&#39;ll call &#34;edible items&#34;, just for explanation purposes in this post. The following items can only be fed once a week, regardless of derivation,&#40;I did a brief test with a Golem/Morx&#41;whether the monster likes or hates the item, and regardless of stress/fatigue conditions. <BR> <BR>Honey Candy <BR>Spiced Cookie <BR>Nitro Juice <BR>Moak Soup <BR>Gassy Potato <BR>Bitter Garlic <BR>Scorpion Claw <BR>Yam Rice Cake <BR>Diet Grass <BR>Energy Ball <BR>Large Egg <BR> <BR>As far as the benefits of the aforementioned items go, I didn&#39;t notice anything outta the norm from what they normally do under the conditions I&#39;ve tested them by, except if &#34;liked a lot&#34;, the item would give a very slight increase in the loyalty meter, and if &#34;hated a lot&#34;, a very slight decrease was observed.  <BR> <BR>Next is the rest of the depleting items, which I&#39;ll call &#34;gift items&#34; for the purpose of explanation in this thread. Again, the gift items were tested under the same criteria as the edible item were. The following gift items can be fed more than once a week, regardless of whether or not the items were liked, hated, whether or not the monster was tired, blah, blah, blah,..... <BR> <BR>Black Pearl <BR>Monster Nip <BR>Pretty Flower <BR>Coral <BR> <BR>The only gift item here that I&#39;ve noticed any visible effect with was the Black Pearl, which relived the small amount of stress regardless of monsters condition. Also, if a gift item, like the edible items, was either liked or hated a lot, gave a corresponding increase/decrease in the loyalty meter. &#40;the increases were very minor, and would most likely need at least close to 50&#43; of the item to fill the loyalty meter all the way full&#41; However, I noticed no decrease at all if the meter was full. &#40;this was part of my test involving Juggalo&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, I posted this up for information purposes. If this is already known, I would like a mod to delete this, to save space on this board. Any comments are always welcome, as they serve to further this type of research into the game.

 Alright, here&#39;s my question.  I&#39;ve noticed that if I have a monster who &#34;looks healthy&#34; and &#34;seems a little stressed&#34; and I give him a black pearl when he likes it or likes it alot I can drill that week and next week he&#39;ll be &#34;seems a little tired, but it won&#39;t mention his stress.  So the assumption is the Black pearl fixed the stress.  Because I rarely feed disliked items I haven&#39;t tested it otherwise.  So the proper test to see if it&#39;s the Black Pearl or the fact he likes it is too raise a monster to the point of stress &#40;feeding disliked foods can do this&#41; and then saving it.  Then give black pearl and drill.  Should come back with no stress warning. <BR> <BR>Then do the same thing with a different monster who dislikes the black pearls and see if it still heals his stress.  That is before we assume it&#39;s the item and not his feelings toward it.  I realize this is hard since most monsters like them.

 A good question. When I get some more game time, I can test this out with a Zan, which seems to loathe Black Pearls. I&#39;ll post up results when I get the opportunity to do so.

 2 tests complete. <BR> <BR>My cosmocchi likes honey candy and Coral.  In both situations, he got a little stressed, I fed the item and trained &#40;not rested&#41; and the following week, he was more tired, but gave no message on stress. <BR> <BR>I believe it has to do with likes and dislikes.  Alternatively, I think there&#39;s a stat just like in MR2 called fear.  Fear and spoil.  The benefit to giving items disliked would be to raise fear, and thus promoting obedience....just a theory at this point. <BR> <BR>Try it on your game too please.

 that theory makes sense, campster - the flip side of it would be the two reactions your monster gives to being praised - either it is happy or it is confident.  these could be manifestations of two parts of the same cycle.   <BR> <BR>also seen in twos:  failures.  my angel has two types of failures - one, where she bends over at the waste and looks like shes almost retching, and the other where she stands straight up and looks kind of dazed.  if you tell her to try harder, one gives you the &#34;harsh&#34; message, the other gives you the &#34;regrets&#34; message; while if you tell her to keep at it, you get &#34;relieved&#34; vs &#34;get them next time&#34;. <BR> <BR>splitting basic measures of a monster&#39;s form, mood, etc was a big part of unlocking the secrets of mr2, and i wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a lot of what we consider to be unitary scales in mr3 turn out to be based on the interaction of two elements as well.

 torey, i noticed the same exact thing with my zan and my joker, just yesterday. the zan either failed and held both elbows &#40;where i said try harder and it regretted what it did&#41; or it held one elbow &#40;where i said keep at it and it was ready for next time&#41;. i dont exactly remember what the joker reactions were to failing, but one was to hunch over with its scythe held off to one side, but i cant remember the other....sorry.

 Yeah, every monster has 2 obvious failure responses.   <BR> <BR>One is a sign of obstinence &#40;he mocks you like a spoiled teenager&#41;, and the other is a sign of exaustion.  On some monsters the difference is obvious. <BR> <BR>Zuum, bobs his head to the side when the drill exhausts him.  He sits down and taunts you when being obstinent. <BR> <BR>Other monsters are slight.  Hare bends at the waist in both instances and bobs his head forward.  He bobs a little lower when tired, than when willful. <BR> <BR>Of the 4 responses you can make, 2 seem to go with obstinence and 2 with lethargy.  <BR> <BR>&#34;No big deal&#34; and &#34;Keep at It&#34; go with Lethargy and &#34;Try Harder&#34; and &#34;Terrible&#34; go with Obstinence. <BR> <BR>of the 2, &#34;no big deal&#34; is a more lenient response and &#34;keep at it&#34; is more of a tough love response. <BR> <BR>&#34;Try harder&#34; is yields encouragement, &#34;Terrible&#34; is a punishment. <BR> <BR>I have no hard data on what follows, it&#39;s just my opinion. <BR> <BR>All 4 responses should be used.  If you&#39;re giving you monster the foods it likes &#40;3-4 blocks&#41; and it&#39;s obstinent you may take a firmer approach, he&#39;s obviously getting spoiled.  But if you are feeding 1 or 2 in likes and he&#39;s willful, lean toward &#34;try harder&#34;.  If you don&#39;t give him anything he likes of course he&#39;ll rebel. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, if you&#39;re giving him 3-4 nutrition and he&#39;s still lethargic, a little firmer response of Keep at it is required.  But if you&#39;re feeding him junk food &#40;1-2 nutrition&#41;, than lean to &#34;no big deal&#34;.  Your monster&#39;s body will tell you, &#34;Junk in, Junk out&#34;. <BR> <BR>This is just the way I&#39;ve approached it about the last month and my failures have been reduced alot. <BR> <BR>I can get through most lifespans with 3-4 failures total with no resets.

 I have noticed that when a monster fails, Fleria says one of two things. She says something along the lines of &#34;&#40;name&#41; did not do very well&#34; or &#34;&#40;name&#41; did not complete its training.&#34; Those are not exact quotes but the message is still the same. Perhaps one type failure has to do with willpower, and the other with fatigue and stress. That is my 2 cents

 I noted that if she says that <BR> <BR>&#34;&#91;MONSTER&#93; did not complete it&#39;s training.&#34; <BR> <BR>then it does the obstinent pose. If she says <BR> <BR>&#34;&#91;MONSTER&#93; did not do very well.&#34; <BR> <BR>then it does the exhausted pose. If you couldn&#39;t find the difference between the two poses, then that&#39;d be a good indicator to use.  <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;ve noted that &#34;Terrible...&#34; is interchanged with &#34;Awful...&#34; what seems like every other time it gets the chance. I also noted that they gave different responses. &#34;Terrible...&#34; usually brings me either &#34;Isn&#39;t that a little harsh?&#34; and &#34;Awful...&#34; yields &#34;It&#39;s depressed...&#34;. Those quotes may not be exact, but it was something like that. I didn&#39;t seem like it gave &#34;Terrible...&#34; only when it was obstinent and &#34;Awful...&#34; only when it was lethargic, but it&#39;s possible.

 Sorry I didn&#39;t include this in the earlier post &#40;which really was too long anyway&#41; <BR> <BR>Remember I said the responses go with the behaviour. <BR> <BR>Well, When Lethargic these are the responses <BR> <BR>No big deal - &#34;It&#39;s relieved&#34; <BR> <BR>Keep at it - &#34;It seems like it&#39;s ready for next time&#34; <BR> <BR>Try Harder - &#34;That&#39;s a little harsh but it&#39;s for Dude&#39;s own good, right?&#34; <BR> <BR>Terrible - &#34;It&#39;s depressed&#34; <BR> <BR>When it&#39;s obstinent these are the responses <BR> <BR>No big deal - &#34;It&#39;s relieved&#34; <BR> <BR>Keep at it - &#34;It&#39;s relieved&#34; <BR> <BR>Try harder - &#34;It looks like it&#39;s regretting what it did.&#34; <BR> <BR>Terrible - &#34;That seems a little harsh, but it&#39;s for Dude&#39;s own good, right? <BR> <BR>Seems to me that what we want is a monster who is ready for next time and regrets willful behavior.  But I digress. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s relieved after obstinence would logically breed more obstinence &#40;as he just got away with defiance&#41; so the only acceptable answers for obstinence are try harder and terrible.  A smack on the wrist is o.k. after being bad.  You can tell I&#39;m a parent. <BR> <BR>being excessively harsh to the fat kid is never profitable so for lethargy, the only acceptable answers would be no big deal and keep at it.  Here it&#39;s acceptable to get the answer It&#39;s relieved, because it wasn&#39;t failing on purpose, it just got tired.  Hence why &#34;ready for next time&#34; seems the best response as the monster seems encouraged &#40;despite it&#39;s fitness problem&#41;.

 Might have skipped it, did this from memory at work.  But they&#39;re accurate.  Don&#39;t remember if it&#39;s different from Terrible. <BR> <BR>I think Awful is from Battle performance.  Or maybe I&#39;m wrong...at work now...can&#39;t check.

 khift, my memory is as muddled as campster&#39;s.  i remember &#34;terrible&#34; and &#34;awful&#34;, but i cant remember the context or if they are the same or what. <BR> <BR>next monster i raise, i will pay closer attention.

 Guys, I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t gone back and verified all this but I&#39;m involved in a couple of projects right now &#40;one MR3 related and one Kitchen cabinet related&#41;.  If someone else could verify my post as correct I&#39;d appreciate it and also verify the responses from battles won and lost please.

Here is some very good info I just received from my Joker, <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Arawn</FONT>, whom has a VERY high willpower &#40;In about 1 yr 3 mo he&#39;s failed 3 times&#41;: <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR><B>Great Responses</B> <BR> <BR>Great job/Beautiful&#42;: It looks happy. <BR>As expected: It looks very satisfied! <BR>Keep going&#42;&#42;: It seems that it understands. <BR>Not quite&#42;&#42;: It seems that it understands. <BR>.........: Is it in a bad mood? <BR> <BR>&#42;: I found that these two interchange on different greats, but not on the same one &#40;If you constantly reset the PS2 it won&#39;t come about until you reach a new great&#41;. <BR>&#42;&#42;: <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Arawn</FONT> is very well-mannered, so if you have a bad-mannered or mild-mannered monster you may receive a different response. <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR><B>Intervals between Great&#39;s depending on response</B> <BR> <BR>Great job/Beautiful: 2 weeks. <BR>As expected: 0 weeks&#42;. <BR>Keep going: 3 weeks. <BR>Not quite: 1 failure&#42;&#42;, 1 week. <BR>........: 1 failure&#42;&#42;, 0 weeks&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>&#42;: <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Arawn</FONT> had a second Great immediately after the 1st. <BR>&#42;&#42;: Rested off in the MF fashion. <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;: I think I have an explanation for this. Once, a rival told me that it was good to be strict on strong will-power monsters, which is probably why it happened this way &#40;Can&#39;t remember who, sorry&#41;. <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>So, apparently the response &#34;As expected!&#34; either increases willpower or keeps it the same &#40;Most likely increases, as <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Arawn</FONT> doesn&#39;t Great several weeks in a row usually&#41;. Although this has been suspected before many times, I don&#39;t believe anyone has done any big research on it like this.

 As I had previously thought, my friend reported that his monster reacts differently to the responses on Greats. So you can pretty much count those out.

 One response is not always correct on my training responses.  Sometimes when being obstinent and you say &#34;no big deal&#34; the response is the same for not being sturn enough in battle. Fleria says, &#34;It thought if was being mad fun of.&#34;  In this case it seems obvious that this answer is not strong enough. <BR> <BR>As far as keeping greats going, when you respond &#34;As expected&#34;, you can get 2 responses.  Either &#34;It looks very satisfied&#34; which produces good results afterwards. or &#34;It looks pretty confident now.&#34;  By observation, but not hard data I have gotten the best response from the confident answer &#40;like 7 greats in 8 drills&#41;.  Now sometimes I get the It looks very satisfied answer on the first great and sometimes the Pretty confident now.  When I get the very satisfied, I alternate between keep going and as expected every other drill and eventually the confident answer shows up. <BR> <BR>This leads me to a theory.  The answer may be in response to a balance between Fear and Spoil.  I&#39;ll try when I get a chance to look at this in the save data and try to find if Fear and Spoil or something similar exists.

 I noticed that when Arawn grew into senility, he lost his characteristic &#39;Pride&#39; and his reactions changed. Before, though, it never really changed. I also noted that when I answered my usual answer for a battle &#40;As Expected&#41; after an easy Free tournament, he got mad. When I used &#34;....&#34;, though, he had no reaction.

 i have gotten another response to &#34;As expected&#34; which was &#34;What!?, &#40;name of monster&#41; says it needs to get better&#34; or something along the lines of that.  this has happened to me after battles and greats.  Just thought you might want to know!

 My friend&#39;s Naga said that it needed to get better when it became senile.... And yes, I do remember seeing &#34;It looks like it can&#39;t feel happy for some reason...&#34; before, but I can&#39;t remember when. Just guessing, it might&#39;ve been when I praised it As Expected/Beautiful on an easy tournament, so I couldn&#39;t really feel the pleasure of winning, but this is just speculation.

 here is my latest observation on the &#34;theory of twos&#34;.  i noticed it when i was training my latest raiden.  like all monsters it had two failure animations - the first, where it stood up straight and breathed hard, like the drill was just too much for it; the second, it quickly crouched down and looked like it was muttering something, like it was shocked it had failed.  after numerous trials and resets, with this monster anyway, i got two different results.  with the first reaction, i could try an easier drill, or a drill in a different region, and it would sometimes succeed.  but with the second reaction, it was lights out...no matter what else i tried, i got the same failure.

 changing away from failure animation for one second.. <BR>i once trained a peligoon and whenever it did a great in a drill, it did the normal backflip/hipshake thing. Then the first time i trained in kalaragi, the great animation changed to stooping down a little/ clenching both fists/ and crying out. That &#34;great&#34; animation stayed with him for the rest of his life, even when i moved to other locations. <BR>i suspect a glitch, maybe since raiden was added to the u.s. version.

 I finally got a chance to get some quality time in on a Zan I&#39;ve been itching to raise. And, since Zan isn&#39;t really into Black Pearls all that much, I thought I&#39;d test out a theory of mine that&#39;s been nagging me for a while. <BR> <BR>I raise the Zan every fourth week of each month, feeding him two-favorite/four-nutrition food at the beginning of each month, and a Black Pearl during the weeks. To make this short, I don&#39;t rest and I rely on venture items for my fatigue relief, Black Pearls for stress relief.  <BR> <BR>However, unlike some of my previous monsters, this Zan didn&#39;t benefit from the very minor stress relief that I experienced from feeding the Black Pearls that the others did. The main reason for this is that my Zan dosen&#39;t like the BP&#39;s at all. So, my findings here? BP&#39;s relief a minor amount of stress only in monsters that have a liking for them.

 Well that kind of proves my point.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the item, but the amount of affection for the item that provides the stress relief.
