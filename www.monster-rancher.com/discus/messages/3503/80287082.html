 I decided to make a thread for this topic, instead of pushing it into an unrelated thread. <BR> <BR>Now, a few days ago, Campster mentioned that he believed that Life Wisdom/Secrets affects Life Recovery Moves. At first, that seemed like a really good possibility.  <BR> <BR>But than i saw the characteristics list at M-R and for Life Secrets it says &#34;Significantly increases the damage from Life attacks.&#34; It said something similar for Life Wisdom, but without the &#39;significantly&#39;. <BR> <BR>Now, that ruins Campster&#39;s theory IMO. Regeneration Techs don&#39;t do damage. Now, someone else said the he/she believes &#39;Life&#39; is reffering to drain type moves, which seems like a possibility, but its not &#39;my&#39; first choice. <BR> <BR>I personally believe that Life Wisdom/Secrets affects moves like stab, pound, beat, and cut. Though i do not have any practicle evidence, this is what i believe.  <BR> <BR>Currently i am raising a Hengar for the Hengar Challenge, and will be doing &#34;a lot&#34; of venturing. I will try to get the Life Secrets to test it out.

 Well, just think of it this way: If Life Wisdom/Secrets affected all those types of attacks, then don&#39;t you think it&#39;d be pretty durn rare? And it would definetly be the tech to have on all Pow type monsters. It would also imbalance the Pow/Int relationship. Most Int attacks are weaker than Pow attacks, but they have elements that could be &#39;boosted&#39;. If Pow gets those elements, then this relationship would be shattered. <BR> <BR>So no, I don&#39;t think that Life Wisdom/Secrets affects the physical attacks. <BR> <BR>P.S. On MF&#39;s game save, there is a Palasaulo that starts with Life Wisdom. That would be an easy way to test the effects of Life Wisdom. I also have a Mogi/Goat with it, but it came off of a CD I have.

 I understand what you mean Khift, but there are some strong Int based techs, just as there are some weak Pow ones. You may very well be right about Life not affecting physical techso. I just can&#39;t think of any better explaination as to what it does affect.

 SF, let&#39;s remember the programmers are Japanese and there are tons of grammatical and spelling errors in the game.  The simple fact they call it damage is just redundant and doesn&#39;t rule out that it affects life moves.  My guess is to find all the moves without an affiliation and try those using the Palasaulo.

 O.k., to start off with my theory that Life is missing info, I collected some info <BR> <BR>The tech affiliations are:   <BR> <BR>Beat, Cut, Pound, Heart, Magic, Water, Wind, Earth,  Flame, Thunder, Lightning <BR> <BR>The secrets/wisdoms listed are: <BR> <BR>Flame/Fire, Water, Ice, Wind, Earth, Lightning, Heart, Magic and Life <BR> <BR>So the only affiliations without a secret/wisdom are Beat, Cut, Pound, Thunder &#40;might work with lightning secrets&#41; but all of these are physical not elemental or magic techs. <BR> <BR>Now, here&#39;s a list of the techs that have no affiliation: <BR> <BR>Unassociated moves    <BR> <BR>breed - name <BR> <BR>C.P. <BR>Big Spin, Balance, Thundarer, Blackhole <BR> <BR>Jell <BR>Jell Sweep, Jell Swallow <BR> <BR>Momo <BR>Full <BR> <BR>Pancho <BR>Trumpet Rush <BR> <BR>Plant <BR>Chew <BR> <BR>Psiroller <BR>Wohoho, Large Roller <BR> <BR>Suezo <BR>Give Me <BR> <BR>Suzurin <BR>Share Pain <BR> <BR>Zan <BR>Assault Dance <BR> <BR>Of these; Black Hole, Large Roller and Share Pain are listed as having the effects &#34;Self&#39;Destruct&#34; which affects the life of the giver. <BR> <BR>Most show an effect of none, Life recovery or slow. <BR> <BR> <BR>Other interesting things are: <BR> <BR>On Mew, Idol shows as Heart only and recovers life. <BR> <BR>Naga&#39;s Energy Drain takes life shows as pound only and drains opponent&#39;s life. <BR> <BR>Pixie&#39;s Heal Ring shows as Magic and recovers life. <BR> <BR>Plant&#39;s Drain shows pound but does transfer life to the Plant. <BR> <BR>Some moves have double affiliation, so it&#39;s safe to assume these four are both the affiliation shown and affiliated with none which could be life. <BR> <BR>That said, There seem to be no moves for Ice wisdom unless it relates in some way to water too.

 I just reread that and see that it would only make sense to me. <BR> <BR>What I&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s possible that Life secrets/wisdom would apply to any move that gives/takes life to/from the attacker.  And that some of there moves show no affiliation at all with any of the beat/water/magic...etc affiliations.
