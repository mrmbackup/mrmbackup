 I raised a Zan to go in my line of Speed &amp; Power-based monsters, and since I needed the encyclopedia entry, I evolved it into a Retsu.  Unfortunately, this means it picked up Tough Skin, which does NOT play in well with a speedster.  I know that if you include Fast Footwork on a creature with Tough Skin/Tough Scales/Stone Body/etc., the two will cancel out.  My question is, is there any other similar trait to Fast Footwork?  Since the whole defense up/evade down trait has several different versions, I wanted to know if the opposite had them, too, or if I&#39;ll have to raise a Hare to cancel things out &#40;and I don&#39;t really care about Hares&#41;.

 fast footwork did not cancel out armor, when i fed a hare heart to a durahan.  we may have to develop a list of specific traits that do and don&#39;t cancel out other specific traits

 Well, when I say &#34;cancel out,&#34; I don&#39;t mean that they both dissappear.  I mean that if they&#39;re both on there, unless one is &#34;more powerful&#34; than the other, they neutralize each other by activating at the same time.  Evade up, Defense Down &#43; Defense Up, Evade Down = Net of zero.  Which is what I&#39;d like to get back to... <BR> <BR>Hmmm....if I could just transfer my Zan&#39;s heart to a Joker &#40;which I had already considered&#41;, its Illusion Cape would cancel out the evasion problem but still leave the defense boost intact...also, is there anything that CAN&#39;T have Tough Skin?  Because there are obviously a lot of things that can&#39;t have Stone Body...or is Tough Skin like Sharp Eyes, and moves freely to any creature?  If I can shake it rather than neutralize it, so much the better.

 It does cancel out, 2 examples.  <BR> <BR>1.While being attacked 2 defence enhancing charecteristics&#40;can&#39;t remember names&#41; showed up with clear circles next to them with a red circle showing up next to fast footwork. <BR> <BR>2.While attacking an opponent a fast footwork charecteristic came up for them with a red circle while for my monster the charecteristic sharp eyes came up with a green circle. <BR> <BR>But these incidences don&#39;t occur all the time. So even if you can forget one charecteristic it still won&#39;t make a major difference that one charecteristic will all of a sudden start exceding, its all probability.

 Intuition works a lot like fast footwork, except that I don&#39;t think it has FF&#39;s downside of increasing damage when a hit occurs. I&#39;ve seen Intuition spontaneously develop &#40;not from exploration&#41; during growth in two Raidens. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not buying into discussions of &#34;cancelling&#34; in the way that you&#39;re implying, ChetFlavin, without seeing some numbers. I&#39;ve seen no evidence to suggest that Armor or ToughSkin reduce damage exactly as much as Fast Footwork increases it. If, for instance, ToughSkin drops damage by 20% and evade by 10% and Fast Footwork increases damage by 10% and evade by 20%, then having both would be worthwhile overall. <BR> <BR>And on the general topic, I raised a Pow/Spd Zan that had Armor, and I firmly believe that the characteristic was what made him able to compete so well at high levels with only mediocre life/def. <BR> <BR>Also, as Torey said, those traits don&#39;t cancel each other in the sense that they cannot exist on the same monster at the same time--they can. I think we&#39;ve gotten some terminology confusion here.

 I didn&#39;t say they would always cancle eachother out, get rid of eachother completly, or that the charecteristics were delt with in an EXACT way. I said its all probability.Besides the way you seem to understand what I said Lao is that they all produced there effect so that Armor and Thick Fur&#40;those def. enhancers i mentioned earlier&#41; would activate and cancel out Fast Footwork. What I meant is that the green circle didn&#39;t show up meaning it wasn&#39;t working. Now if anyone thinks that the green,red, and clear circles don&#39;t mean anything to whether a charecteristic works or not then why were they put in the game?

 I don&#39;t quite understand what ChetFlavin is trying to say...on either of his posts.  Could you try summarizing?

 I guess it is kind of confusing, but anyways all I am saying is that some charecteristics conflict with others to where sometimes neither will work in a battle. There are also sometimes where an enemies charecteristic will beat out your own charecteristic and vice versa. So far in my experience I have come to believe that it is all random.
