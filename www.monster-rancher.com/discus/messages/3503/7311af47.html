 Exactly how many characteristics can a single monster have? I&#39;ve got a Dark Bringer &#40;Henger/Kalaragi&#41;, who has &#34;Radar, Resists Heat, Water Secrets, Hypotension, Armor, Sharp Eyes, Wind Secrets, and Directionless&#34; as his characteristics. He inherited most of these from the heart of a Strawberry &#40;Hare/Brillia&#41;, who also had Fast Footwork. Recently, this Henger began fighting and I noticed that when he was attacked, the unlisted Fast Footwork popped up, bring my monster&#39;s characteristics to nine. Has this happened to anyone else?

 I&#39;ve only had seven, myself, and the list visibly holds eight, so I can&#39;t say much on this part.  If you&#39;re sure that the list held an unmarked trait, then this may be something new to research on.  I&#39;m not going to speak for the others, but this is the first encounter of such that I&#39;ve seen before.

 once you get a heartline through a significant number of monsters, that list fills up.  i have had many monsters with eight characteristics.  the nagging question is, though, are there charcteristics which affect the monster which dont make the list?  in other words, when a characteristic drops off the list, does it stop affecting the monster, or does it continue to exert an invisible influence?

 Vader &#40;my Dark Bringer&#41; entered his last stage an hour ago &#40;he&#39;s fighting away the rest of his life&#41;, and Fast Footwork continues to pop up, despite not being there. I&#39;ve made a third back up file just incase. I&#39;ll probably try to see how many characteristics I can fit on a monster &#40;I have many monsters with &#34;--- Wisdom&#34; and such&#41;, and post my results. I&#39;ll also try to see if unlisted techs can be passed down.

 I too have seen something a bit similar.  I had just got a lesione from the shrine.  After a few weeks of training i noticed that after scolding or complementing the trait narcissistic popped up. I immediately checked the characteristics page and found no such characteristic and I never once gave him a monster heart.

 UPDATE: I gave the heart of my nine-char. Henger to a baby monster to a Night Flyer. Fast Footwork passed from the heart &#40;despite the fact that it was never listed on any of Henger&#39;s characteristic lists&#41; to the Night Flyer &#40;Fast Footwork probably passed because the Flyer had no characteristics, and Resists Heat and Radar can&#39;t be passed&#41;. I also tried giving the same heart to a Pixie with three characteristics. Resists Heat, Radar, and Fast Footwork were not passed. <BR> <BR>So, the game DOES keep track of more than eight characteristics. I&#39;ll research some on this and try to determine how many characteristics can be had with one monster/heart.

 Characteristics off the chart are only temporary.  For example: early in the game I had wind secrets.  Later on, I retrieved more characteristics and it gets pushed off, I never see it anymore, cept the one time i passed that heart with wind secrets as the 9th characteristic.  One of the top chars were taken off, and it was then the 8th one.  Then it was pushed off again later.  I still have that heart, and proving that off the chart chars are temporary, i passed it to a monster with wind wisdeom &#40;it should replace that and thus, be 1st on the chars&#41;.  And, guess what.  Wind secrets never passed on, and it was off the chart since forever.  And, when i read these posts, I thought my wind secrets were there the whole time, till i tested this.  So lemme put it short and not a story: chars off the chart are passed once or twice, and will be gone thereafter.

 Great job, Blueskullnbonez!  Thanks for the findings.  So, it would behoove the trainer to focus solely on monsters with desired traits, then...since 8 is the MAX possible to keep.

 So then, we&#39;ve confirmed that a monster can keep eight characteristics permanently, but it can also have at least one characteristic temporarily, and any of the nine can be passed down to another monster.

 I once had a monster that had 8 characteristics and acquired the characteristic &#39;Heart Secrets&#39;. This char did not appear on the screen. However, when this monster reached senility, it lost another character and Heart Secrets appeared....

 ya - that happens to me a lot now, that i am passing hearts thru more and more generations...there is at least one &#34;hidden characteristic&#34; in my 8 characteristic hearts - maybe more; it&#39;s hard to keep track.

 Ugh... That means that some of my last Pixie&#39;s undesired characteristics are still hanging around in the new one. I was afraid of that. &#40;for I discovered this myself when my 8 characteristic pixie got lightning wisdom, which didn&#39;r show up on the list untill after she lost one of the others&#41;
