 I recently finished off a Bui I was raising up,  <BR>and the way I decided to make him go was to  <BR>battle, feed a Gassy Potato, rest, freeze and  <BR>repeat after I got the &#34;won&#39;t be as active  <BR>message&#34; from Fleria. Anyway, on with my  <BR>question. The Bui liked battle, and disliked  <BR>eating, which played well into what I was  <BR>doing. But about after an estimated ten battles  <BR>of this &#34;method&#34;, I got ready to send him to the  <BR>Big 5 in Takarama, and Fleria said &#34;Fandango  <BR>&#40;my Bui&#39;s name&#41; looks too scared to battle. Are   <BR>you sure you want to do this?&#34;  <BR> <BR>This is something I&#39;ve never witnessed before  <BR>in 1100&#43; years of gametime, but I decided to  <BR>let him battle anyway &#40;I let him do the battles&#41;.  <BR>He had no problem routing Radiance all by  <BR>himself, &#40;the others chickened out&#41; which  <BR>leads me to ask? What the heck is this? Any  <BR>input would be greatly appreciated here, but  <BR>IMO, I really don&#39;t think it harms your monster if  <BR>you say &#34;yes&#34; after Fleria asks this weird  <BR>question.

 I saw it once, it was so long ago I don&#39;t recall the breed. What I do recall was that I got the message once in its last year, but subsequent battles there was no warning, and did fine in the tourneys. Maybe it&#39;s a characteristics thing...

 ya, i have gotten the same warning with a couple of my monsters.  funny thing is, just like you, i made him fight anyway, and he kicked a high level tourney - even the monsters who didnt give up.  and, like you, i noticed no ill after-effects in the following weeks or months. <BR> <BR>maybe if you were to take your monster to a tourney and lose after getting this warning, something bad might happen...but i havent had that happen to me yet.

 I&#39;ve only seen the &#34;too scared to fight&#34; reation once. My cousin was raising a Henger and Gadamon came by. He tried to fight her, and was warned that her monster was much stronger than his. he ignored the message, and tried to fight anyways. Then his monster went into a &#34;scared&#34; pose and was told that it afraid to fight. <BR> <BR>My guess is that it&#39;s when the monster is worried to fight, as we both raised Hengers from the same CD, and I never got that message &#40;but I never got the message that my rival had a stronger monster&#41;.

 Hmmm.... I intend on doing my money grubber method &#40;fight, feed a nutrition balancing item, rest, freeze, repeat&#41; on my current Joker that I&#39;m raising to see if I can get that weird message to appear again, only this time I&#39;ll say &#34;no&#34; to the fight to see what happens. &#40;This weird incident has been on my mind for some time now, and I wanna see what the heck it&#39;s all about.&#41;

 Could this possibly have anything to do with the so-called &#34;will&#34; of the monster?  Was any of these monsters timid, passionate, or any other trait that may contribute to a refined personality?  I&#39;m taking a stab in the dark here, but it sounds to me as if it was a sort of &#34;doting&#34; problem.  Perhaps, outside traits such as &#34;Confident&#34; play a part in this?  I HAVE noticed that one that is soft on a monster tends to have a monster with less constitution to harsh reactions.  Personally, though, I&#39;ve never gotten it in all my 30 game years of play.

 I&#39;ve seen the &#34;looks too scared to fight&#34; message lots of times.  It usually happens to monsters I&#39;ve just brought to the farm &#40;I&#39;m talking about 3 or so weeks old&#41;.  I got it with a zan &#40;it was 2wks old&#41; when I decided to have it fight right after giving it my tiger&#39;s heart &#40;the tiger was never afraid to fight btw&#41;.  Anyhow, I&#39;ve never gotten that from a monster that&#39;s over a month old.  I usually don&#39;t make them fight if they&#39;re scared, so I never really thought about it...

 I&#39;ve gotten the &#34;scared to fight&#34; message a <BR>few times raising usasos that start out &#34;timid&#34;. <BR>All of them have stopped being &#34;timid&#34; and <BR>stopped getting that note after their first <BR>growth spurt.  I expect that it&#39;s related to <BR>personality and willpower &#40;heart?&#41;.

 Interesting.  It may be something like how a child is scared to get onto a bicycle for the first time, but once they get on, they start laughing and enjoying themselves.  While fighting in a tourney is nothing like learning to ride a bike, for the monsters it seems to illicit a similar series of emotions.
