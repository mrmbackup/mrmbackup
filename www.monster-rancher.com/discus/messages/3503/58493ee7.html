Ok, i havn&#39;t seen this on any other part of the site, so i figured i&#39;d list it here. For those of you who don&#39;t know, There are three &#34;Hard&#34; drills in each location, and your monster has to be &#34;inspired&#34; by them to find them. I beleive that level plays a role in finding locations &#40;i.e., you can find one right away, but the second until your around C rank, and the third until your around A rank. I don&#39;t know if these are the exact ranks, thats just a rough guess. In Kalaragi, the three are easy to find. &#40;Note that i am assuming R2 is being held down &#40;Giving you a fixed camera view&#41; so when i say go left, i mean to the left side of the screen, not the monsters left&#41;And, without further ado, here they are:  <BR> <BR>Note: Since the people reading this probably aren&#39;t very far along in Kalaragi, i just want to warn them against the Kalaragi bug. If you do not know about it, STOP PLAYING IN KALARAGI UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. Go to the MR3 FAQ section for more information. <BR> <BR>Fishing: Start off going up and left, across the lilypad over to the path that runs along the left cliff face. follow the path along towards the front left hand side, until it does a U-turn and goes up a hill. Continue up a hill until you pass beneath the waterfall. You should encounter a light of the earth. Under the falls, if you let go of R2, you should be near some bats. Search this area for the drill &#34;fishing&#34; <BR> <BR>Chase: Follow the directions above until the point where you get to the waterfall. Continue up, and you get to a small shelf at the top, where you have the choice of jumping down. In the back right hand corner, there is a light of the earth. Search it for &#34;Chase&#34; <BR> <BR>Life Risk: From the starting point, go straight towards the camera. In the middle of the front of the center lily pad, there is a light of the earth. This is the drill. <BR> <BR>Lord Location: There are three lilypads in the center of the lagoon; the main one on which you started, and two two either side that are used as bridges to the land. Go to the lily pad on the right, and search the rock that is in front of it. You will find the lord, which is an Ape. <BR> <BR>Noisy Halls: <BR>1: Go across the left lily pad, and when right when you first step off the lily pad and onto land, search in the little corner that you are in. <BR>2: Follow the path described in the &#34;Chase&#34; drill location to get to the little &#39;shelf&#39; overlooking the lagoon. There is a branch in the front left corner of the shelf; search it for a noisy hall. <BR>3: Go across the right lily pad, to the narrow strip of land running along the cliff. Follow this strip to its end; at the end of it is a noisy hall. <BR> <BR>The most efficient way to get all three of these noisy halls is to do them in the order that i listed. When you get the second one, simply choose the &#34;jump down&#34; option when you are on the frontright side of the &#39;shelf&#39;, and you will land VERY close to the third one. <BR> <BR>Hope this info helps someone. Good luck, and happy ranching!
