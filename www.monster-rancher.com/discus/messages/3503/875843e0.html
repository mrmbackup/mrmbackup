 In a chat conversation with the campster, he mentioned that orbs seem to &#39;flow freely&#39; once a monster was at B rank, and above a certain composite stat number. But then he said once they get to a certain point, with really high stats, the orbs seem to dry up. Any comments? Observations? -Anything from you guys with all 999 monsters would be helpful.

 i have kept all-999 monsters above B rank as &#34;orb hunters&#34;.  generally, sooner or later, they are able to get into a battle at the right spot and get an orb. <BR> <BR>however, here, as with chars, my monsters skew away from the normal center of distribution in terms of their orb finding abilities.  some, for no reason i can see, find orbs rather easily; others need tons of resets. <BR> <BR>i am guessing, with no support whatsoever, that there is still an undiscovered &#34;x factor&#34; which improves or dampens a monsters ability to find orbs &#91;and chars&#93;.  i really do not have a clue what it might be, however.

 Yes, I think Campster is right in a way, but I think that finding orbs is the same pain as it has always been for me. To find my orb, I usually use a S-Rank Dummy monster with a Stat Comp of 3000 &#43;-, and he seems to do alright. Meaning that he finds an orb, when I battle the strongest monster, &#40;Which is true right&#41;. <BR> <BR>When I fight a monster in a Venture, like a puny one, I seem to get nothing, so I reset. Then I go back to that venture, to the other side of the level then I searched last time, and I sometimes battle a Dragon &#40;I don&#39;t know why, but everytime I get an orb, I battled a dragon except for in Takrama&#41; and he usually gives me one. <BR> <BR>Well, I&#39;m not to sure about this, but I think as long as you have an B Class &#43; Monster, your fine.

 I agree with the existence of some sort of lower-level &#34;trigger&#34; including rank/stats, I guess what I was wondering about was input on them becoming bad again at finding them once certain stats were acheived. Has anyone else had their monster turn from being good at it to being bad at it after raising stats? <BR> <BR>My personal experience has been that some of my monsters are better at it than others. One Zan &#40;Izuna&#41; could get a Water Orb 100% of the time in one spot, and only needed to try one or two spots in other locales to get them all the time. Of course, I kept him frozen, and just hunted orbs with him, so he never got incredibly high stats to test out becoming bad at it. -Other monsters I have had of different breeds with the same stats were never as good as this monster at getting orbs.

 Actually, I&#39;ve found a very simple system for getting an Orb 100% of the time when I need one.  I always make sure to use a monster that has an actual chance of beating the orb-keeper, of course, but my strategy is to simply save before going on an Earthlight hunt, then run around, counting each search &#40;search #1, 2, 3, etc.&#41;.  The game is completely non-random at deciding which search number gives you a fight &#40;if any&#41;.  So if I know that my seventh search is going to get me into battle, I reset, and then look around, making sure that my seventh search is in one of the &#34;Bad Feeling&#34; spots.  Voila, instant encounter with an orb-keeper!
