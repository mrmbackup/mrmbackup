 Hey, I figured I&#39;d run some tests on a little known topic here: Heart Crystals.  OK, here&#39;s what I did.  Just recently, my 4 year old Enki died &#40;Durahan/? from Onimusha: Warlords&#41;.  I wrote down two of the stats that I focused on with him: Power and Speed.  His Power was 985, and his Speed was 999.  I then used the encylcopedia to regerenate a Galum &#40;Tiger/Goat from Disc 2 of a Billy Joel collection&#41;.  It&#39;s starting Power was 129, and starting Speed was 165.  I then created two saves.  I gave a my Enki&#39;s Heart Crystal to the newborn save first.  His Power increased to 326, and his Speed increased to 364.  If you do the math, that is roughly a 20% increase.  I then let my second save Galum evolve once, into its prime.  I gave it the Heart Crystal.  The stats were higher &#40;for obvious reasons&#41;, but still the Heart Crystal gave a 20% increase in everything.  Finally, I used the third save file and let it evolve twice, to old age when its not as active.  I gave it the Heart Crystal, and, sure enough, there was the same 20% increase.  So, what this all means is that a Heart Crystal stores 20% of your monster&#39;s stats.  It also keeps a record of EVERY characteristic the monster EVER had.  For instance, my Enki, as an adult, had Easily Tired as a characteristic.  However, in old age, it rid itself of that characteristic.  But, under the Heart Crystal status screen, Easily Tired was still listed.  I tried a few tests with characteristics, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be random.  My Galum received Armor and Iron Heart each time.  This leads me to believe that a monster can only receive PHYSICAL characteristics, as I&#39;ve never seen a monster get Dim-witted, Easily Tired, Confident, or the like.  I could be wrong, though.  Finally, for move that is saved, I can safely say it does not choose the highest level attack.  I don&#39;t know any way of figuring this out, except by guessing.  I honestly believe it saves the move you used the most, because my Heart Crystal had Avalanch, and I never used any other move &#40;almost never&#41;.  Anyway, I hope anyone who reads this now has a better understanding of Heart Crystals.  Glad to be of service.  :&#41;

 Do you mean an increase of 20% of the dead monster&#39;s stats, or 20% of the living monster&#39;s stats? Since you don&#39;t give any numbers for any but the first attempt, it&#39;s hard to tell. <BR> <BR>I know that the time I created a monster with 999 in 2 stats, and almost no improvement in the others, I saw a big spike &#40;200&#43; points&#41; in the 2 stats that were high in the dead monster, while the lower ones were only raised by ten points or so.

 I&#39;m sorry.  I guess I should have been more clear.  You take 20% of the dead monster&#39;s stats, and whatever number you get, add that to the living monster&#39;s stats.  For instance, if your dead monster had 999 in Speed, you would take 20% of 999 &#40;roughly 199.9 but the game rounds up to 200&#41;, and add that to your living monster&#39;s stats.  That&#39;s why my Tiger went from 165 to 364 &#40;a 201 point boost&#41;.  Hope that clears it up.

 I had a second gen. heart crystal and decided to see if it made any difference when I gave it to my new monster.  I generated the Galooda &#40;Durahan/Takrama&#41; from the Gladiator Disc.  I don&#39;t have the exact numbers with me but I gave it to him right away, after 8 months &#40;75% bonded&#41; and after his first birthday, before he evolved &#40;100% bonded&#41; after that I gave up. <BR> <BR>I gave up because it added the exact same stats to my new creature.  The 20% rule seems to apply.  200 points to my maxed stat, and so on down the line. <BR> <BR>So imho the heart should be given to the creature at birth, it will help more than later in life.

 One thing you may want to wait for before you give your new critter the heart.  Look at the heart and see which tech it will give.  If you maxed out that tech make sure the new monster has that tech before givin it the heart.  If the new monster already has the tech it will gain the skill levels of the heart instead of just getting a new tech.  So before you die make sure you get a stone of the highest tech you have &#40;and hopefully the one you used the most&#41;.  On the first expedition the monster should visit the lord with the stone, then use the heart. <BR> <BR>Shane

 The Heart of my naga from the Princess Bride died and I gave the heart to my Golem/Goat and he recieved both Sore Loser and Confident meaning it is likely the 2 highest charistics are given... I also trained the two into them &#40;&#34;as expected&#34; and &#34;awful&#34; when he won and lost... ALWAYS&#41; but I have done no formal research so please don&#39;t consider this written in stone or flame me if my info is wrong.

 no prob - i have taken two hearts thru 4 monsters each now, and in this small database, i seem to be picking up characteristics as i go - both hearts now transmit 4 characteristics each.

 A rather interesting twist to MR, these Hearts. <BR> <BR>I just finished raising a Valkyrie &#40;Pixie/???&#41;and gave her heart to a Farn &#40;Pixie/Morx&#41;.  It was a very nice addition.  The Farn got a definite 20% gain of all the Valkyrie&#39;s stats plus a tech. <BR> <BR>Still miss the combining of two mosnters, but this is still a nice twist.
