 Okay, I&#39;m new to this blog site and not sure where to post this, so I&#39;ll vent here. Am I the only one that is highly upset that the Worm species has been discontinued! I&#39;m guessing Beaclon took over that look in the subspecies part but to do away with the Worms entirely. That was my favorite monster in MR1 and MR2. I&#39;ve yet to play 3 and 4 but I assume it&#39;s not there either. Anyone know why they did this? I mean, it started with 400 monsters and now it&#39;s less than that. In MRDS it&#39;s only 241 I believe. They&#39;ve made new monsters but also discontinued some. Why is this?

 In the console games, each character model, i.e. monster, takes over a month&#39;s time for a an employee to create. To have more monsters would mean hiring more employees and greater costs for a game series that hasn&#39;t been very profitable in a decade. <BR> <BR>They add new monsters so that the new games seem worthwhile to purchase. So, some old ones have to go.

 I didn&#39;t know that. Well, thank you! Still kinda&#39; pissed Worm got discontinued but that&#39;s how the cookie crumbles I guess.

 There are several monsters that I would have loved to have seen expanded upon and continued that frankly, just got tossed on the cutting room floor.  But some of the new monsters are pretty fun as well.  And honestly, I&#39;m just grateful to get a new Monster Rancher game at all so I&#39;ll take whatever monsters they can give me. ^_^ <BR> <BR>But yes, worm certainly was a popular one.

 True. I am kinda&#39; fond of the Bree species. I just wish they would re-make MR1 and MR2 with PS3 graphics and a new story line. But alas, we&#39;re not the one&#39;s controlling it.

 I agree, worm is my all-time favorite monster &#40;He&#39;s just so adorable&#41; but he&#39;s gone =&#40;  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll keep my hopes up that he&#39;ll come back in a future MR someday, Assuming they keep making the games.

 Worm has been my favorite since the release of MR1, and I&#39;ll still go back to those games to solely raise worms. They are just so cute and viscious at the same time. <BR> <BR>I really think that they could have expanded on Worm Hatching a lot more and turned it into something even more awesome then it already was.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still shocked that they removed Zuum though, that seemed right out of left field. <BR> <BR>But I digress, Worm, you shall be missed. Perhaps one day our paths will cross once more.

 I actually preferred Dino to Zuum.  It just looked so much cooler. =P

 I agree 100%! <BR> <BR>But Zuum became the staple and the replacement of Dino, and I wasn&#39;t expecting them to take them out, I thought they were popular. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t describe how shocked I was when Dino didn&#39;t make an appearance in MR2, I raised every single Dino breed in MR1 and loved them! Easily my second favorite monster to Worm.

 I LOVE the little hidden activities in MR1 and MR2!  They were so  <BR>awesome!  I loved planting the mock seeds on the  <BR>ranch, collecting henger pieces, getting your hopper to dig up  <BR>artifacts, and ESPECIALLY hatching a pixie/worm from a worm  <BR>cocoon!  That was by far my favourite :&#41; <BR> <BR>Argh! I must say that I hate how they NEVER use the stone discs  <BR>&#40;I always hated the term &#34;saucer stone&#34;&#41; concept in the shrine!   <BR>The magic of it was SO cool... with the four pillars and a disc  <BR>stone? AMAZING. <BR> <BR>I feel these were the areas of the series that made a lasting  <BR>appeal &#40;at least for me&#41;.  I find myself still purchasing  <BR>every single MR game since the first, but raising one or two  <BR>monsters for a month and calling it a day.  I&#39;ll always be  <BR>a loyal fan.  Yes, even if worm, zuum, and zilla never come back  <BR>:&#40;   <BR> <BR>C&#39;est la vie.

 I think Dino was the first monster I raised in Monster Rancher ever. I think it was a pure. <BR> <BR>I admit I was never a fan of the worm, but to each their own really. <BR> <BR>Me I miss the true Undine and the Jill was amusing. I also preferred Mint&#39;s look more then Aero.. but.. <BR> <BR>Still got pixies, still got dragons, still got Durahan and still has Zan. <BR> <BR>So I&#39;m still generally happy. <BR> <BR>Of course I like pandas too, so the Pandamew was a nice surprise.
