 Alright well first I am hoping that MR for the  <BR>smartphone does well. If it does then we have a  <BR>chance of a new MR console game, or if anything a  <BR>PSP one would be nice.  For MR 6 they could, imo,  <BR>take the basic MR 2 elements and expand on them.   <BR>Update the graphics, and if anything add some online  <BR>play. Online tournaments and trading of monsters.   <BR>And maybe one day MFO will go Global.  Considering  <BR>how well Digimon Masters Online is doing, we could  <BR>have a chance.

 I agree. Monster Rancher 2 elements should make a return in a possible Monster Rancher sequel. I would love to see monsters that have not come back since MR2 appear. I would also like o see Joker in his MR2 apperance which imo was cooler.

 MFO/MF6 for PSVita would be totally awesome. I also  <BR>liked EVO&#39;s training system, because you actually  <BR>controlled how the training worked out, so I guess  <BR>that, combined with MR2&#39;s drills, could make for an  <BR>awesome set of mini-games, especially with the  <BR>touchscreen.

 Ten years ago, I was hoping for mainstream, top- <BR>graphics, deep storylines, maybe 1k&#43; monsters; now,  <BR>I&#39;d be happy if they did a MR2 remake with slightly  <BR>better graphics, and maybe thirty or forty more  <BR>monsters.  It would take minimal effort. Heh.

 I would love to see it on PC, with the expanded graphical limit, and the combo of CDs,DVDs,Blu-rays would allow for many more people to use the shrine feature. &#40;For those who dont have CDs or Blu-rays&#41; <BR> <BR>And I dont really need a huge improvement, just remake MR2, and update it a bit. The story I couldnt really care less about, Please dont make it a huge feature. <BR> <BR>More, More ,More of MR2 is really all I need.

 Completely agree with Darkling. A remake of MR2 with  <BR>some obvious much needed improvments for PC would be  <BR>awesome, especially with some form of online play.

 One of the nicest things about a game being released on PC, &#40;If done right&#41; is graphical options, it allows for a much larger audience to play a single game. With Monster rancher, if you were to release the game on PC rather than console, the amount of people who can play it equals the amount of people who have a PC built from 2006-2012 &#40;Or present for future readers&#41;. Plus, the 360,PS3, and Wii are all 6 years old, they dont even come close in comparison to PC, and I am sure you have heard this discussion alot.
