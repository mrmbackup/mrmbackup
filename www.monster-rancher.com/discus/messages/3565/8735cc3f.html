So many times, at other sites, I see people &#40;ok teens&#41; posting that they are amazed that I am over 40 and still play games. Quite often the comments are not positive. Term most often used is &#34;pathetic&#34;. <BR> <BR>My perspective has always been that I started gaming in my teens on mainframes, and as games evolved, I tried a little bit of everything. And, it&#39;s been wonderful fun. My standard reply, if I bother with the small-minded, is &#34;when exactly do you plan on stop buying games?&#34; <BR> <BR>Anyway, I always knew I wasn&#39;t alone. A large percent of MRM&#39;s regulars are over 30, and I have always seen adults buying games for themselves. Here&#39;s a <A HREF="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/biznews/1009story2_business.shtml" TARGET="_blank">news article</A> with more details. Now if the game industry would recognise us, and start making/marketing games for us, instead of assuming that we only play yahtzee.

 What do teens know about being over 40?  <BR>Personally, everyone I know who sees/knows my 50&#43; year old dad playing video games think its the coolest thing in the world.

 I&#39;m only 22 and yet I get told all the time that I should stop playing video games. I don&#39;t listen to them. Just tell them hey this is something I enjoy and nobody is going to stop me from playing.

 Yeah, I &#42;WISH&#42; I had parents that played videogames...we could relate so much more.  My grandparents play old school games &#40;Tetris for example&#41; and it&#39;s so awesome knowing if we&#39;re at an event and I&#39;m bored I can just ask to borrow their gameboy ^_^

 My parents were mainly into SNES. I know kids can always get money from parents but it take people with jobs to be able to afford a good collection of games.

 When will I stop playing video games? Well, hopefully never! As long as I have time I&#39;ll keep going, and I&#39;m 15 so I&#39;m one teen you can count out from your statement! :&#41; <BR>I &#42;wish&#42; my parents were into video games, that&#39;d be cool, I&#39;v already got my sister to start racing with me on my PS2,it took a few years, but that&#39;s a start!

<FONT COLOR="119911">too old ha! my dad is about 36 and he loves video games &#40;especially fishing and shooting games.&#41; you are never too old to stop playing v.g.&#39;s.V.G.&#39;s are designed to help you relax &#40;although they aren&#39;t always relaxing&#41; and have a good time.they are basically a book that has popped up on the screen and allows you to control the story line.so saying that you are too old to read books is like saying that you are too old to read a book.</FONT>

 &#34;so saying that you are too old to read books is like saying that you are too old to read a book.&#34; What a revelation that is! lol. i know what u mean green reaper. just thought that was a little odd.  <BR> <BR>Any who, my dad like to play video games, but i make him stop after awhile, because it is too embarassing to let anyone see him play.  He actually that bad, but he doesnt realize that.I think its great to play video games and be older, it lets you realate to kids better, and is fun to play. Keep on gaming old timers! you go grandma! j/k. ;_&#42;

<FONT COLOR="119911">&#34;saying you are too old to read a book is like saying that you are too old to play a video game&#34; is, of course, what i really meant, i was spacing out at the time. thanks for pointing that out S.S.54 cause it did sound weird, didn&#39;t it.</FONT>

 My dad thinks video games are all the same. You are either beating someone with a stick or driving through indistinct terrain. He was just never introduced early enough. It would be cool if he did play though. If he did, maybe he wouldn&#39;t have the cordination of a drunken five year old with two left hands. No offnese daddy...
