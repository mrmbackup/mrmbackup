<B>What&#39;s a Street Team?</B> <BR>A street team is a group of ordinary people who help spread the word about something that&#39;s cool and new. It&#39;s a form of marketing where people tell friends at school, work, at the mall, wherever they hang out that they know about something interesting. <BR> <BR><B>How much time do I have to spend to be a part of this?</B> <BR>One of the nice things about street teams is you can spend as much or little time as you want on it. Some projects simply involve mentioning a new game when you are in a game store, others may mean doing something online for 15 minutes a week. Other projects may take more time, but the great part is that you decide. <BR> <BR><B>Do I get paid?</B> <BR>Nope, but what you do get &#40;aside from the satisfaction of doing something fun and meaningful&#41; is a chance to help Tecmo sell more MR games, so we know that the series will continue. The ranching games have always had a small, cult following, but their sales figures have been modest. We&#39;d like to see Tecmo think of making new MR games as a no-brainer way of being sucessful, and thus guarantee many more years of new ranching games. <BR> <BR><B>Can I get in trouble doing this?</B> <BR>You&#39;ll need to check your local ordinances to see if any suggestions here break laws. &#40;For example, in many cities, it is illegal to put signs on utility poles.&#41; If something is illegal where you live, <B>don&#39;t do it</B>! We won&#39;t have any suggestions posted that are generally recognised to be illegal in the US as a whole, but it&#39;s up to you to check your city, county, and state laws. <BR> <BR><B>Why doesn&#39;t Tecmo just put a lot of ads on TV and in magazines?</B> <BR>Tecmo isn&#39;t the biggest company out there, and doesn&#39;t have unlimited access to tons of cash. &#40;who does?&#41; Advertising costs a lot of money, and, doesn&#39;t always work. How great is a TV commercial if no one sees it?  <BR> <BR>Word of mouth is the best sort of advertising, it captures peoples&#39; interest in ways that other advertising can&#39;t. And, it&#39;s honest. You&#39;re here because you really like Monster Rancher, right? People can see and value genuine fan enthusiasm as opposed to ads because ads always have an aura of &#39;trying too hard.&#39; <BR> <BR>Additionally, your other efforts, fliers, stickers, t-shirt wearing, etc. help get the word out at times and places that traditional advertising simply cannot reach.
