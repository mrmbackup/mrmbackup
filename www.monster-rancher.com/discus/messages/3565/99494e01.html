Remember how Tecmo remade Dead or Alive 2 for the PS2?  For the sake of argument, let&#39;s just say Tecmo decides to remake mr3 like they did with DOA2.  Similar to what Namco is doing with Soul Calibur 2 with the exclusives, Not only would Tecmo add 5 more breeds, but this time they are also going to team up with a company like Capcom, Namco, Jim Henson Productions, Squaresoft, etc. to make some neat rares and a section of &#34;legendary monsters&#34; that are so unique they will have to be in their own section.  The chart would be something like this:  <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Suezo</TD><TD> Mocchi</TD><TD> Jell</TD><TD>Octopee</TD><TD> Momo</TD><TD> Golem </TD></TR><TR><TD>Zuum</TD><TD> Tiger</TD><TD> Hare</TD><TD> Mew</TD><TD> Beaklon</TD><TD> Dragon </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dakkung</TD><TD> Baku</TD><TD> Pixie</TD><TD> Durahan</TD><TD> Naga</TD><TD> Joker </TD></TR><TR><TD>Color Pandora</TD><TD> Plant</TD><TD> Hengar</TD><TD> Zan</TD><TD> Lesion</TD><TD> Suzurin </TD></TR><TR><TD>Psiroller</TD><TD>Pancho</TD><TD> Mogi</TD><TD> Raiden</TD><TD> Gitan</TD><TD> Ogyo </TD></TR><TR><TD>Breed A</TD><TD> Breed B</TD><TD> Breed C</TD><TD> Breed D</TD><TD> Breed E</TD><TD> Legends</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>1&#41; What breeds would you add, or make up for the five extra spots? <BR> <BR>2&#41; What company would you want Tecmo to work with when they make the legends, and rares? After picking the company, what kind of legends and rares would should the company add to the mr3 remake?  You can only pick one company. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Should the MR3 remake stay on the PS2, or go to a different system as DOA2 did when it used to be a Dreamcast only title? <BR> <BR>The only rule is that the legends you pick have to be somewhat similar to the original mr3 breeds to an extent.  They can look extremely different and have different stat gains, but they have to behave like the default breeds in battle &#40;e.g. you pick a Behemoth from the Final Fantasy games as a legendary monster if Square works with Tecmo on the MR3 remake, but that Behemoth has to fight like a MR3 Tiger.  However, it can behave differenly from the MR3 Tigers, and have different stats, and lifespans&#41;.  Oh yeah, you can only pick one company too. <BR> <BR>  Sorry to make that lengthy, but I thought I had to explain the &#34;legends&#34;.  One more thing; The company can be anyone you want since Namco more or less teammed up with McFarlane&#39;s company &#40;Link doesn&#39;t count because they managed to get Nintendo&#39;s permission, and they are mainly working with Todd McFarlane&#39;s company&#41;.  It does not have to be game related, but it has to be somewhat recognizable. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t wait to hear some of the responses, but if I have to clarify anything, let me know about so I can explain it.  I&#39;ll post mine later since this post is pretty long right now.

 Being the FF addict I am I would haev to go with Square, all though it&#39;s so improbable it&#39;s not even funny. I&#39;m sure a lot of people will use square so I&#39;ll try to be unique. I guess Square could add... <BR> <BR>Chocobo - This is a trademark, no? The arent a ton of chickens beside Phoenix and Raiden, and  I dont think it would fight like either of those. I imagine it would have high accuracy and evasion since they are used as a mode of transportation, so they could fight like some Tigers do with low guts and high accuracy moves. <BR>Different locales could give you different types of chocobo, like Red, Black, Yellow, Pink and Purple Polkadotted, etc. <BR> <BR>Frogs - Heh, remember Chrono Trigger? He was KIND OF a monster... but this would sell games on its on, with CT&#39;s fanbase. He&#39;d basically be durahan with higher speed and lower defence, and Water spells for his INT moves. <BR> <BR>Leviathan - Come on, he&#39;s a big evil sea serpant thing who is the ruler of summons, how can you not like him ^&#62;^. Besides Ogyo and Lesione there is almost no Water elemental stuff so Leviathan and Frog can help. Leviathan probably have a horrible guts regen as a sacrafic for looking cool, but he could make up for it with lots of powerful INT-based Wave attacks, he could even steal moves... Tsunami, Wave Riding, Tidal Wave, and the Ice Swords come to mine. <BR> <BR>Pip - The weird cute fuzzy thing that game Chrono Cross a pokemon aspect. It evolved on what types of spells it cast, and then became holy or neutral or evil. For moves it would have it&#39;s fairly weak techskills, some of which would only be able to bad nature Pips&#40;they&#39;d have to bring nature back for Pip at least&#41;and some only to good. They&#39;d also need to start with a move of all of the elements, since that effected thier evolution in the game they are from. Hopefully then we&#39;d have something that can put the Secrets skills to good use. <BR> <BR>NORG - Lmao, remember the giant blob thing that was the proptier of Garden in FF8? Wouldnt you just love scoloding him? XD! Seriously though, he could, uh... hit you with his gaint... self o.O. And he could use weak generally ineffective magic like he did in the boss fight. And he could talk back in that weird second-grader style english he speaks in when you tell him to &#34;Try Harder!&#34; and &#34;Not quite&#34;. Training him would be fun, all right =&#41; <BR> <BR>Legend - Bahamut&#40;FFX style&#41; - I dont like this version of bahamut, too many colors, but it makes him stand out from dragons. He&#39;d be a lot like the dragons in battle too - Low guts regen, high damage. I think since he gets the shiny legend title bahamuts would have a longer life span than they do, and have some of the best Power and Intelligence &#40;he disses you pretty well in FF8&#41; gains and skills in the game. <BR> <BR>Heh, that was long, but fun. Great poll =&#41;

 Missed which system it should be on... Square is PS2-only &#40;well, it has a GBA and GCN title coming out, but primarily PS2&#41; as it is, so it would stay on PS2. And it should be noted I managed to typo on my first sentence, at least it should draw attention. &#62;.&#60; <BR> <BR>And one other thing about Square - they could remake it with improved graphics in sound. Nothing in MR&#39;s music history can match Square&#39;s composer&#40;whos name I will not attempt to spell&#41;. And square is pretty well known for getting the best graphics out of the system &#40;unforutnently, Pixies would be drooled over even more than they are now by teenagers who cant seem to get a girl =P... they drool over pixels and wonder why no one will date them &#42;shakes head&#42;&#41;

 It should stay on the PS2, and add the following breeds: <BR> <BR>Phoenix:I know this was in MR2, but I want to see it come back, with more than 2 sub-breeds. <BR> <BR>Lupor:Kinda like a Tiger, but more stocky, is black in color, and gets better gains in Pow. and Def. and worse gains in Speed and Ski. <BR> <BR>Dino:Another monster from an earlier game, but this time the Dino might be harder to get. <BR> <BR>Magic:As you might have guessed, I miss lots of the Mr1/2 only monster. But this time around, the Magic would have even MORE breeds. <BR> <BR>The company I&#39;d have Tecmo work with&#40;should&#39;ve said this at the start, but I was more eager to put monsters there&#41; would be ID software.&#40;I&#39;m a major Doom I/II addict&#41;. <BR> <BR>Legend: Cyberzan:It&#39;s a Zan-like monster with very high Pow., metal replacin various limbs, and an attitude problem.

 Ok, it looks like it&#39;s my turn.  Oh yeah, before I begin, you can add characters some might not know, but try to explain them as best as you can: <BR> <BR>For Breeds: Gali, Jill, Ape, Phoenix, and Arrowhead. <BR> <BR>It would be cool if Tecmo teammed up with Capcom like Namco did with McFarlane companies.  Here&#39;s a list of possible rares and legends with some brief descriptions from each Capcom game series: <BR> <BR>Mega Man Series: <BR>1. Gutsman - Rare Golem. <BR>2. Rush - Rare Tiger <BR> <BR>Resident Evil Series: <BR>1. RE3 Nemesis - Legend who fights like Golem. <BR>2. Zombie Dog - Rare Tiger <BR> <BR>Street Fighter: <BR>1. Blanka - Legend who fights like a Jill, Baku, or Naga.  I mean, what SF fan who likes MR does not want to raise Blanka!? <BR>2. Garuda from SF EX - Legend who fights like Zan.   <BR>3. Amingo &#40;sp?&#41; - Legend who fights like a Plant. <BR> <BR>Darkstalkers: <BR>1. J. Talbain - Rare Tiger <BR>2. Huitzil - Legend who fights like a Hengar.  It&#39;s a robot who can transform like Hengar. <BR>3. Victor - Rare Golem <BR>4. Morrigan - Rare Pixie <BR>5. Marionette - Legend who fights like a Joker <BR>6. Sasquatch - Legend who fights like a Jill <BR> <BR>Ghosts and Goblins: <BR>1. Red Arremer - Legend who fights like a Dragon.  Check out the Ghoul Realm website for more info. <BR>2. Knight Arthur&#39;s Gold Armor from Ghouls and Ghosts - Rare Durahan. <BR> <BR>Other characters from Capcom games: <BR>1. Zelkin &#40;Star Gladiator&#41; - Legend who fights like a Raiden.    <BR>2. Bilstein &#40;Star Gladiator&#41; - Rare Durahan.   <BR>3. Sodom &#40;Final Fight&#41; - Legend who fights like a Durahan.   <BR>4. A super deformed version of Kappah &#40;Star Gladiator&#41; - Rare Mocchi.   <BR>5. Bishamon/Hanya - Both Legends based on Durahan.   <BR> <BR>Keep up the good ideas.  I am glad most of you like the post, but I&#39;ll explain my reasons for picking these characters later.

1. <BR>Breed A-Moombas-Remeber FF8? They&#39;re the little red lion things. <BR> <BR>Breed B-I agree with Synre...Chocobos <BR> <BR>Breed C-Kuro...this one is actually from the  <BR>ever annoying Monster Rancher show and it looks really cool. For those who haven&#39;t seen it, it&#39;s very humanlike. I don&#39;t know if Kuro is the name for one combined or not but I think it might be, looked like a ???/Dino, the ??? being whatever it is that makes a Kuro a Kuro. <BR> <BR>Breed D-Behemoth. Another character from FF, they&#39;re the big purple monsters. <BR> <BR>Breed E-&#42;looks around the room for ideas&#42; Couch! lol. On a more serious note, something along the line of being from armored core. The game needs a big robot&#40;big like dragons for MR&#41;, hengers lack in size... <BR> <BR>Legend-Bahamut! FF8 version, sorry Synre, he just looks cooler in this one, originality must be sacraficed for looks...sometimes. Come on, who doesn&#39;t love that bad<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;&#42;&#42;</FONT> dragon? He&#39;d be great to have as a special dragon. <BR> <BR>Another Legend-This one is my own idea, maybe it&#39;s already in an MR game but...I don&#39;t think so. It would be a Durahan, it would have the colouration like Krsnik&#40;durahan/gali&#41;,except with flowing dark eyes filled with pain and sorrow and black angel wings. I can&#39;t really describe what the body itself would look like, just imagine what you think would look good with the rest of the description. <BR> <BR>2. Square or Agetec, nuf&#39; said. <BR>3. PS2, definately

 Yeah, I named my Garu Moomba because of that =P <BR> <BR>And yeah, the FF8 Bahamut looks cooler, but the FFX version was more original and colorful and legendary looking. And it didnt cuss me out.

 I forgot to answer #3.  It should stay on the PS2, but if the X-Box/GC can do a better job, Tecmo should give it a shot.  After all, I can&#39;t imagine anyone missing out on a chance to trash talk the top mr breeders via X-Box Live &#40;no offense to the pros like DB, Torey, and Lisa&#41; :P

 Putting alot of thought into this I have 2 final things to say...1: Actually, any Bahamut would do, they all look cool, even the one from FF9 &#42;shudders at the thought of FF9&#42; 2: If they bring back a breed from another MR title...worms...I miss those things SO VERY MUCH. I sucked at training them and yet they still managed to become my favourites, and I can no longer see them, my MR2 game was stolen in 2001...I&#39;m still trying to find another copy in my vicinity.

 I think the final fantasy ideas are great! Here are my ideas. <BR>Legend- Ifrit: the huge summon that looks like a golem/dragon with horns. would probobly fight like an equal int./str. golem with fire moves <BR>E rank- Chocobo: come on everyone has to know this! would probobly fight like a naga <BR>D rank- Cait Sith: The robotic kitty from final fantasy 7. would probobly fight like a mew <BR>C rank- Not sure what it should be called but a thing like the winged Genesis from crisis core. would probobly fight like a male pixie <BR>B rank- Nanaki&#40;Red XIII&#41;: The tiger like charecter from final fantasy 7. would fight like a tiger <BR>A rank- Bahamut: It is the huge, cool dragon from final fantasy. would probobly fight like a zuum
