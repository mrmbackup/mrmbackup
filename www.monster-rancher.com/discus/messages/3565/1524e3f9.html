 just read the newsweek article on &#34;nintendo&#39;s racy new games&#34;.  in it appears a description of the &#34;racy new game&#34; &#91;which basically sounds like a shoot &#39;em up with some suggestion, rather than actual depiction, of female nudity&#93; and a statistic - 21% of all video game players are over the age of 35.  much of the article is devoted to discussion by game company execs about how to capture this burgeoning market. <BR> <BR>here&#39;s a hint on how they can capture me.  in the description of &#34;lara croft with breast reduction&#34; &#91;or whatever its called&#93; they describe a feature where when the character on the screen is hit, the view goes blurry to indicate your wooziness. it got me to thinking.  one of the things i like about mr and mr2, which is different from most other games, is that in most games you &#34;are&#34; the character on the screen.  in mr and mr2 you &#34;are not&#34; - you &#34;are&#34; yourself, managing characters on the screen in the raising, fighting, and breeding of your stable of monsters. <BR> <BR>be interested to hear others&#39; take on this.

 Well, I&#39;m not over 35, but my SO is close to that, at least. His take on this is to get rid of some of the &#39;splatter&#39; effects that people go for in hte games nowdays. Everything seems to be built aruond shoot-em-up or combo-your-opponent-to-death. He prefers the skill, rather than the gore. Guns are one thing, but the challenge is in the playing, and not in the &#39;How many times can I kill people?&#39;.  <BR> <BR>My outlook is actually vaguely similar to his, though for me, I mostly look for a more in-depth storyline. Or at least in-depth play-value. Pokemon &#40;believe it or not&#41;, Monster Rancher &#40;GASP! ME?!&#41;, and almost all RPGs are very engaging to me for these reasons. I don&#39;t need to see the sword running someone through and blood spatternig for the effect. I just need to know how to progress the storyline, as well as raising my character &#40;or monster&#41; in one way or another.

 I enjoy games that have more purpose than, &#34;run &amp; jump &amp; grab all the stars you can find&#34;. That&#39;s why I like sims, I really enjoy biulding something and seeing how well it turns out. I enjoy puzzle games as well and REALLY wish they&#39;d bring Tetris Attack 64 to the US.

 I like developing characters,problem solving,puzzles or mysteries. Might and Magic,Romance of the 3 Kingdoms were a couple favorites before MR2. <BR>  But I liked some shootem ups,battling  games too. Killer Instinct,the Abrams tank game; Turok and Star Fox on 64. <BR> <BR>But overall I&#39;d still prefer an RPG to most other game types.

 I&#39;m 28, and play this and other games as well. I gotta get a break from reallife BS every once in a while, and MR and other games is usually how I do it.
