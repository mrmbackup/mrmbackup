 I know that every Game goes through a process that is ment to make location and &#34;Americanized&#34; As to sell better in the states. While i love any and all official art shown for the MF site and differnt views on the game. But i finally got my paws on the original MF 1 and Mf 2 With Instuction manuals. I have abad habbit of sending my MR/MF games to friends so they get a chance to play the series. In any event. <BR> <BR>While I love the MR games... Im leaning toward importing japanese Monster Farm games just for the manuals, let alone the sweet  games themselves. I know it costs a bit more to make the instructions a bit more... Colorful. But DUDE MF1 HAS COMIC BOOK Like Explanations for parts of the game, and the Second ACTUALLY uses pictures of items and grapgic pictations of how to read the stats and such. <BR> <BR>I was just wondering Really... how come we don&#39;t get to see more of this stuff? Seeing more art for the games would Im Actually getting my paws on the japanese guide books, but i dunno where to get my paws on the CD guide. The original japanese MR soundtrack in the mail.

 This is something that the US office is actually repsonsible for producing. The catch is, generally, the marketing pros there want to make a name for themselves by trying to think up clever designs on their own. BTW, MF for PS2 &#40;MR3 in NA&#41; has really cool pictures in circles around the page numbers!

 If the US Office wants to make an impression, it Has a long ways yet to go. I mean we see less then a third of Any of the MArketing advertising if That over the net. Not even a tenth of the Paper/media of MF stuff. They Could of even copy pasted that stuff for these games and it STILL WOULD of been fantastic.   <BR> <BR>&#42;noses&#42; Would it be braking any regulations if i scanned these Manuals and parts of the guide As long as i give credit where the credit is due? and maybe found a reliable server to host it on? &#42;has no clue where to go for something like that&#42; <BR> <BR>Also... I&#39;d love to find some of the rumored MF2 Posters.

 I have never found a MF2 poster.... <BR> <BR>Yeah, you could probably scan them and nothing would happen. You can try photobucket.com, however they re-size larger images, so you&#39;ll probably have to go one page at a time if you want people to be able to really see things. <BR> <BR>Oh ya, I suspect the US office is on a budget, remember the games don&#39;t sell as well here as they do in Japan-of course that, it could be argued, is a vicious cycle.
