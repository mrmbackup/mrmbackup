 Well that&#39;s a totally cute idea. I was hoping when I saw the link that you actually had made one and were gonna show it off ~ <BR> <BR>Either way I&#39;m a disaster in the kitchen, so I can&#39;t do it x.x

 The cake itself would be quite easy &#40;big and round. How big are saucer stones, anyways? I always guessed around a foot in diameter, but that&#39;s just me.&#41; It&#39;s the frosting that would be a nightmare. I guess you could use yellow first, then draw on the design on top of that, in black with those squeezable frosting tubes. But that&#39;s still one wickedly hard thing to draw &#40;for me, at least&#41;. Any ideas on how to simplify it, maybe? Could be a fun project!

<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'gm'-!>
They&#39;ve been alternately depicted as both approximately one foot and two feet in diameter in the games and concept art, but since this is a cake, you can be flexible. You could even try making saucer stone cupcakes if you fancied. It&#39;d make drawing the sigil easier. <BR> <BR>As for the color, the stones were brown in the games and yellow in the cartoon, so you could pick one or the other. It&#39;s an opportunity to use maple frosting. You could also try one of MR4&#39;s curious disk colors &#40;blue, rose, rainbow, etc.&#41;, especially if you&#39;re making cupcakes. <BR> <BR>Say, this cupcakes idea is sounding better and better. Maybe I&#39;ll try that sometime.

 Hey, that&#39;s really clever! I wouldn&#39;t have thought of the curious disk colors, up until you mentioned it. I suppose in that case, assuming you have the right-shaped pans, you could do IMa&#39;s seal &#40;that dragon thing? Anyone else know what I&#39;m talking about? It&#39;s hard to describe&#41; or the tablets from the MRAdvance games - they were octagons, weren&#39;t they? <BR> <BR>But, you&#39;re right, GM, I really like the sound of Saucer Cupcakes. Cupcake stones. Whichever sounds better.
