 I’d like to start off by saying that this is an awesome website this is and that I’m happy to finally be a part of it. Now for my actual idea. <BR>To start off with this would probably work best on the Game Boy but I suppose it could work on the PS2 as well. What would happen is there would be 3 different MR titles out at once each taking place in a different time period. The time periods would be: Past; like when the shrine was first discovered, Present; about MR3 or 4 time, and Future; flying cars, robots, not so much MR future but more Real World future. Each of these games would have 3 “new” monster breeds &#40;monsters I just made up&#41; and 5 monsters not featured in any other version. You would be able to link the different versions together and trade monsters thus being able to obtain monsters not featured in that game &#40;if for some reason this is done on the PS2 you would still need all 3 games just you would not trade monsters just encyclopedia/book data&#41;. Meaning in order to complete your encyclopedia/book you would need all 3 versions or friends with different versions. Below I have the ideas for the monsters to be featured in each game and descriptions for any new or altered &#40;I’ll explain later&#41; monsters. <BR> <BR>&#42; = new monster  # = altered monster <BR> <BR>All Versions       Past               Present          Future <BR> <BR>Mocchi               Monol           Lesione         Metalner <BR>Suezo                  Gali              Durahan        Zan <BR>Pixie                    Dino            Jell                Ghost <BR>Dragon                Henger        Tiger              Gitan <BR>Mogi                  &#42;Mystic       &#42;Ursa             &#42;Cresent <BR>Phoenix <BR>#Moo <BR>&#42;Imp <BR>&#42;Toxin <BR> <BR>Descriptions of new/altered monsters: <BR> <BR>Moo- Name is really just a reference to MR TV show where Moo was the bad guy. I had planned to use Moo in the games’ plots. He will either look like a shadowy creature or a Frankenstein monster, example Dragons wings, Tiger’s horns, Zan’s claw thingies &#40;what are those?&#41;. Haven’t quite decided on attacks for shadow except making a black hole to suck other monster in to but if it is a Frankenstein monster it would use other monsters trademark attacks like Mocchi Beam or Megaray. Moo would only be obtainable after filling the encyclopedia/book with every other monster and would only be obtainable through book. <BR> <BR>Imp- Tiny male Pixie with big feet. Uses various cartoony weapons such as sticks of dynamite or the cartoon cliché extending boxing glove device. Sort of a comic relief character like Doodle. <BR> <BR>Toxin- The body would be composed of toxic gasses in the shape of a human head, however like Jell it would be able to change shapes, namely to an actual body for training. It’s attacks would mostly resemble a Naga’s like suffocate or life siphon &#40;sounds so much better than life steal&#41;. <BR> <BR>Mystic- A shy, tiny &#40;slightly smaller than Mocchi&#41; fuzz ball whose only visible anatomical features are eyes. Most of its attacks would reveal other body parts like stomp=feet, clap=hands, ect. Ultimate attack would be growing at least 10 times its size and rolling over the enemy. <BR> <BR>Ursa- Big bear. Over exaggerated claws and teeth, maybe a pattern on its fur? I wanted a bear monster in this game but I couldn’t make a very original one. Would appreciate any ideas for his appearance/attacks. <BR> <BR>Crescent- A half moon monster. Would have attacks like boomerang and moonlight. <BR> <BR>The plots for these games would all have Moo as the Bad Guy/Final Boss/whatever. The Past version would explain Moo’s origin; the Present, his reason for trying to destroy/take over the world, the Future, his demise. <BR>I would gladly accept any questions, comments, or criticism on any of my ideas. And finally I would like to say that I know not all, if any, of my ideas will make it into the games. Whew that’s a lot of typing for me; I’m going to go soak my fingers now.

 It seems like a decent idea except it could be on the ds, be one game&#40;part 1 part 2 part 3&#41;, and ursa sounds alot like ursarang from pokemon. Pretty creative but it needs more main breeds.

 Trading sounds like pokemon too.   <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll stick to my ranching thanks and shrining things.  No need for trading...
