Looks like Japan will have an online PC game later this year. The service will be free, but people will have to pay real cash for in-game items. Here&#39;s the link: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://rpgfan.com/news/2006/1089.html" TARGET="_blank">RPGFan.com</A>

 Pay for items with real money?  I don&#39;t really like that idea.  But then again I won&#39;t pay to play a game I already paid for either.  :P

 &#42;regains composure&#42; <BR> <BR>Can you give some examples of this real-life money for items thing? How micro are the microtransactions?

 Personally i dont much like that idea, i dont really want to blow my money on stuff in game, and besides since you have to use real money will you end up getting real money for wining tourneys and what not?

 If you ask me, I believe they acutally intend to include the ability to purchase items with real-life money in addition to the in-game currency.  <BR> <BR>We don&#39;t have a lot of specifics, though, so many who&#39;d look at the context of that would very likely be alienated regardless. Especially amongst American consumers.

I found a PDF on Tecmo&#39;s Japanese site that was uploaded on the same day as the MFO announcement, and has the logos of both Tecmo and Gamepot. It might shed some light on the thing: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.tecmo.co.jp/company/pdf/2006021501.pdf" TARGET="_top">http://www.tecmo.co.jp/company/pdf/2006021501.pdf</A>

 It&#39;s a lot less eciting than you&#39;d imagine. It says eseentially what the other link said, except each time Tecmo and GamePot are mentioned, there&#39;s a brief company description given, one whole paragraph is a recap of the history of the MF/MR game series, and another is the history of GamePot.

 What so boody long for them to do the online fighting?  I&#39;d gladly buy the game just to compete against other people, and if the items look interesting, I wouldn&#39;t mind spending cash on them.  Heck, I&#39;ll even import it if I have to if it means I can play with other ranchers. <BR> <BR>I just pray to God they will REALLY support it &#40;Update it where we get all the breeds, and a lot of new ones&#41;, and not repeat the same mistakes Sega made with Phantasy Star Online &#40;Treat your Japanese customers with quality service while treating the others like crap, do nothing about hacking, rely on your stupidest fanboys for support etc. &#41;, or  SquareEnix did with FFXI &#40;Wretched economy, &#91;Slight&#93; bias towards the Japanese players, etc.&#41;.  However, seeing all 5 versions of PSO become total failures while experiencing the chaos that&#39;s FFXI, I&#39;m not expecting much from a company like Tecmo. =/

 Actually, PSO was quite successful. In fact, they&#39;re making a large-scale sequel titled Phantasy Star Universe. FFXI was very successful, and is getting an XBox 360 port. <BR> <BR>As for MRO, the only apparent online aspect would be the battles. A single online capability isn&#39;t exactly comparable to full-blown ORPG or MMORPG systems, since they&#39;re different animals. <BR> <BR>Also, never, ever expect every monster breed in a single game. Ever.

 Interesting... forgive me or saying this but it sorta has a digimon look to it.  What with the little thing on the guy&#39;s head and all...maybe I have just played Digimon world too much :-&#40; Anyway, if they charge for items than i am out because i would end up broke in about five minutes after i buy every item to try to see what it does...

 Apparently, you know little of MMOs: <BR> <BR>PSO had 5 incarnations, and all 5 of them failed to produce quality service, as the Non-Japanese servers had been decimated by Hackers and Sega&#39;s quality &#34;We don&#39;t care unless you&#39;re from Japan or one of our stupid fanboys&#34; customer service.  A game can be successful, but it&#39;s a technical failure when a company has yet to produce a stable server.  This is expected in most Asian MMOs.  I know a lot of people who are VERY skeptical about PSU since their characters have been destoryed by Hackers, and Sega to this very day does little to address it &#40;The US PSO: Blue Burst is a joke since it has half of the content the Japanese had, and honestly that&#39;s pathetic&#41;. <BR> <BR>Have you even played FFXI!?  You literally cannot make any progress unless you&#39;re a Black Mage, or a &#34;currently in-demand&#34; job, while the game&#39;s unforgiving learning curve and xp gring hurt its sales when other MMOs like World of Warcraft came out.  It&#39;s been fixed to make the game a &#34;bit more friendly&#34;, but it still scarred a lot of people.  Apparently, the 360 isn&#39;t any better from the original FFXI, although the add-on might make things better &#40;...for Black Mages and Rangers, two of the most infamous jobs in the game&#41;. <BR> <BR>The point I tried to make was that a lot of MMOs from companies like Sega and Square are just terrible due to either the old EQ layout &#40;Grind for over 6 hours, but if you die, you&#39;re severly punished&#41;, broken mechanics or the lack of real concern for the International service.  I expect the same thing to come from Tecmo to be honest &#40;especially after playing MR4&#41;. <BR> <BR>Sorry to make a big argument about it.

 So, disagreeing with you regarding Asian MMOs makes me ignorant of MMOs.  <BR> <BR>Heh, seriously, though, at the official RPG Maker community -- which I administrate -- many, many members I converse with regularly haven&#39;t had many bad experiences with PSO, and enjoy it very much. I&#39;m more inclined to take the word of the majority, frankly. 50&#43; to 1 is a bit of a landslide on that part. <BR> <BR>As for FFXI, I cannot be sure. My community&#39;s split over it. <BR> <BR>Of course, I was indeed refering to sales numbers when I mentioned they were successful. But I don&#39;t think MRO will suffer from these problems, which I&#39;ve yet to expericne, since it appears that the only actual online aspect would be the battles and item purchasing. <BR> <BR>Sorry I don&#39;t share your cynicism, but we&#39;re going way off topic. Back to MRO.

 I think they are waiting to see how popular it is, and to work out any issues before bringing it here. Since this is a major step for Tecmo into the PC world &#40;it&#39;s only their second game&#41; I expect they will be cautious. Since mR5 didn&#39;t sell well in Japan, they probably have to be very cautious about future investment in the series.

 T_T Why isn&#39;t there ever any good games for Macs? &#40;Just in general&#41; I&#39;d like to play this, but not if I have to buy the game AND a new computer... Considering how hard it is to get most games for a Mac, i have no hope.... <BR> <BR>Ok, pitty party over. This game sounds good really but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely it&#39;ll come out in the west unless it&#39;s reeeeeally popular in Japan.
