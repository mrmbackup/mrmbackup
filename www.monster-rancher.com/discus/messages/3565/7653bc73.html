 Sorry I haven&#39;t been around, if anyone has noticed.  The main reason is because I&#39;ve been buying cheap Dreamcast games in record numbers.  Well, it&#39;s a record for me at least.  I&#39;ve picked up the following games in the last week: <BR> <BR>Rayman 2 <BR>Virtua Tennis <BR>Seventh Cross: Evolution <BR>Super Runabout - San Fransisco <BR>Test Drive V-Rally <BR>Speed Devils Online Racing <BR>Ecco the Dolphin <BR> <BR>All of this was under $100, including tax &amp; shipping.  Some of these games are under $10 &#40;super runabout and test drive were the only ones over $20 and they were $25&#41;.  So I&#39;m going to be a bit busy with other games, which is a shame because I was having some fun with MR2. <BR> <BR>Now, I dare anyone to find as much gameplay for the price on the PS2, Xbox, or Gamecube!

 Already have PSO actually, got it the day BEFORE it officially launched.  Sa should be another purchase soon, but Sa2 is still too expensive.  I had Shenmue for a while, traded it in, I might get it again, and POSSIBLY Shenmue 2, but that&#39;s like $60. <BR> <BR>Other games I already have: <BR>Test Drive: LeMans <BR>Metropolis Street Racer <BR>Worms World Party <BR>Dead or Alive 2 <BR> <BR>Games I have had/played <BR>Tony Hawk <BR>Tony Hawk 2 <BR>Dragon Riders <BR>Sega GT <BR>Seaman <BR> <BR>maybe some others, can&#39;t remember... <BR>Games I&#39;m thinking of getting <BR>Elemental Gimmick Gear &#40;$5&#41; <BR>Armada &#40;$10&#41; <BR>Tokyo Extreme Racer &#40;$10&#41; <BR>Deep Fighter &#40;$10&#41; <BR>Monaco GP &#40;$14&#41; <BR>Soul Calibur &#40;$25&#41;

 Ah, yes, I have Jet Grind Radio too.  That&#39;s a must-have for any DC owner, especially since it&#39;s $10.

 Now that I remember, Soul Calibur was actually pretty darn good for a fighting game.

 If you want to talk replay-ability BC, then i have to agree with hengersrock, the Genesis was one of the best systems of its day, only failing because the SNES got Street Fighter 2 first, however, he forgot to mention the Sega CDX which allowed those great games like Lunar: The silver Story to be played. Ecco, Sonic &#40;any of them, all of great gameplay&#41;, and Streets of Rage &#40;only played 1 and 2, and 2 was the better IMHO&#41; are just some of the wonders the Sega had.  At $40 for the genesis, and games anywhere between $5 and $50 &#40;the really rare ones&#41;, the Genesis or Sega CDX has one of the best video game libraries available.

 Yeah, i actually have a &#39;Genesis 3&#39;, the last restyle.  I think the only game I have is the 6-pack which has like Golden Axe and Sonic and some other games.  I&#39;ve been thinking of getting more games fo rit, but I already have two consoles that need outlets, and my surge strips are all full.  So, I&#39;m just going to concentrate on the DC since game prices getting so low.  Just found Elemental Gimmick Gear for $5, that&#39;s going in my next batch of purchases.  Unfornatunately, I do HAVE to get Soul Calibur &#40;$25&#41; and other games like Toky Xtreme Rcaer which are between $20-$30.  Still great prices for &#40;relatively&#41; new games, considering the PS2 and Xbox games can cost $55.
