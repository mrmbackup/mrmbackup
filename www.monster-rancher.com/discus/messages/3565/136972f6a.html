 Ok with the Nintendo DS selling over 21 million copies worldwide and simulation games such as that of Nintendogs that is all the rage, it is a no brainer for Tecmo to enter the market with DS hardware.  With better graphic capabilities than the GBA you can have somewhat lesser PSX graphics with a MR game on the go.  You can train any time anywhere.  Things included would be most of the main breeds to date but eliminating less popular ones such as monols, Nitons, Gaboos etc. which are all rather simplistic looking and have similiar counterparts like jells, and discs.  The game would have an advanced raising and lifespan system similiar to MR2 with added items and with monthly feeding comes a drink too.  Like water, milk, juice.  There would be errantries for techs, battles for fame and money, just plain ranching and also an advanced job system where you could raise monsters and take part in real time jobs such as monster police who would eliminate bands or gangs of evil monsters who roam around attacking the city.   <BR> <BR>You would get a ranch with a fence, house, barn, pond, small woods, and maybe even a neighbor.  The main new feature of ranching would eliminate combining and replace it with training two monsters at once.  So the barn is divided and has 2 sections.  For example you could raise a pixie and a tiger who could both roam the ranch at the same time. Different monsters enact differently with diffrent monsters.  Such as Tigers would growl at katos because they are cattish, and Golems could walk around holding a small mochhi in their hands.   Note you can train one monster at once if you prefer.  The top screen would show the ranch and the monsters the bottom would show statistics like drills and stats.  This dual training would also eliminate combining for you could choose for your monsters to &#34;breed&#34; and lay and egg which contains a monster.   <BR> <BR>Example   Male GOLEM/TIGER <BR>Breeds with- Female Monol <BR> Monol lays egg and a Furred Wall, Golem, Monol, Golem Monol, Tiger, and a Golem Tiger could hatch from the egg.   <BR> <BR>You could also speed train monsters if you don&#39;t like mononity of the weeks and choose to train by months 1months = 1 wk <BR> <BR>Example Gali normally gets a 10 in int for a study <BR>        Gali gains 40 for 1 month 10 x 4 = 40 <BR> <BR>Also like MR2 in the tournaments the monsters vary and you also get to see the trainer picture of who owns the monster. To battle you select the move to use on the bottom screen with the stylus and watch it in action on the top battle screen. <BR> <BR>There would be secrets to unlock monsters and other items. <BR> <BR> <BR>I think in all this would be a very good complete game many would like to own.

There are so many things wrong with this post, I don&#39;t know where to start. <BR> <BR><I>you could choose for your monsters to &#34;breed&#34;</I> <BR> <BR>First of all, TECMO will not put &#34;breeding&#34; as you so calmly suggested. TECMO does not need to have sex-related topics, especially to an ESRB rated E game. This topic has come up so many times, that Lisa is most likely tired of it. I have posted this so that you don&#39;t need other&#39;s angry posts, although I have posted likewise. I would read the office of Mayor, even if you won&#39;t remember what you read, you need to learn what you can and can&#39;t post before you do so. I am not a moderator, and am not trying to pose as one. But I really would stop posting about 3-week old topics. I have read other posts about the same topic, so read other posts as well. <BR> <BR><I>it is a no brainer for TECMO to enter the market with DS hardware</I> <BR> <BR>Have you not read that TECMO can&#39;t afford to make another game without boosting sales? Again, Office of Mayor. Take this post to heart, so that you do not have to deal with angry posts from others, like I said, even though I have posted likewise.

 Also, there is another, more early conversation about the very same thing. I can&#39;t understand why you didn&#39;t post there. MRM, and especially Lisa, don&#39;t need more than 1 topic conversation. I am not the nicest or meanest person ot the board. Be cautious that there are others that post angrier than I. Though all of you that do, I am not making bad comments about you. I am just pointing out that there are those that don&#39;t take these kind of posts with open arms.

 Ok I agree with your later statement but, I didn&#39;t thin it should be an M rated game!  Think back to Pokemon ruby and sapphire if you&#39;ve ever played it some pokemon will lay an egg together and you have a baby pokemon.  I did not intend to try to make an MR game offensive.

 Why would a monster rancher game ever want to do something that a pokemon game already did, on purpose anyway?? The types of combining they have tried are all good, they don&#39;t need something new anyway.

 If MR had breeding like Pokemon, then it would most likely be sued by Nintendo. That is Pokemon&#39;s cameo, and should NOT be used by another company without permission. Laying an egg is another of Pokemon&#39;s cameos. If you like Pokemon so much, then play Pokemon. I know you did not intend to make it, but just read the section in The cafe called Suggestions For Tecmo, under there is a conversation called &#34;Petition TECMO&#34;. There you will find that a young girl stated the same thing that you did.

 Then howcome all RPG&#39;s arent sued by various companies because half of them are all the same anyway!   <BR> <BR>So many other games have borrowed ideas from others anyway.   <BR> <BR>But I believe my suggestion here has at least a few good ideas like training by months to help get away from the boringness from repeated drills from MR2.

I suppose, but have you taken the time to see if any of them ask permission? Have you spent the time to see if they were in league with other companies? That is what I am talking about. If MR and TECMO weren&#39;t sued, they might need to pay Nintendo money. The same thing happened when Apple&#174; sued some other company because they didn&#39;t pay to use their trademark and products, and Apple&#174; won.

 I&#39;m sorry, but you can&#39;t sue for something as general as laying eggs. you just can&#39;t. <BR> <BR>Due to your logic, every RPG could sue the others because they all use MP &#40;well, alot use MP&#41;  <BR> <BR> <BR>However, I agree with Sturnum. TECMO simply can&#39;t afford it.

 Yes I guess they can&#39;t but I mean how low are they on cash reserves?  By the way you guys talk about it they should be shut down by now!   <BR> <BR>Also, thank you Silver for mentioning that you can&#39;t sue &#40;well maybe you can try&#41; for such small general things.  Also I don&#39;t know how any permission things go but I recently saw the upcoming Mario Hoops is being made by Sqaure Enix.  How they get permission to use Nintendo character&#39;s I&#39;m not sure.

 I&#39;m a little curious why it is that every time someone uses the word &#34;breeding&#34;, someone else jumps down their throat waving the &#34;M&#34; rating around. If &#34;breeding&#34; implied graphic sexual content, then Gallop Racer and it&#39;s assorted knockoffs would never have been made. Heck, Final Fanasy 7 included chocobo breeding way back in the day and I don&#39;t remember any angry mobs demanding that it be put in a brown wrapper before it could be sold to the unsuspecting masses. <BR> <BR>If you prefer &#34;combining&#34; frozen monsters because it preserves the flavor of the game, fine. Say so. Maybe I&#39;ve just read too many of these messages today and so it&#39;s come to my attention where I&#39;d normally not notice it. In any case, there&#39;s no conceptual difference between &#34;breeding&#34; and &#34;combining&#34; except that the former is something that would actually happen on a ranch whereas the second is just hand-waving around a game mechanic that prevents you from having more than one monster in your stable at a time.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s nothing inherently awful about &#34;breeding&#34;. It just doesn&#39;t fit the milieu of the game at this point.

 Then ask Lisa yourself, and you will find out why. I am just pointing out what has been said previously, and directing it to those that don&#39;t understand. If you think that you are so knowledgable in this, then do so as to suggest it.

 The main reason for no DS game is poor sales of the GBA games. Each of those had a little over 10,000 units sell, not enough to earn back the development costs. Since so many MR games have lost money, Tecmo is being very cautious right now. <BR> <BR>You guys have to understand that the president of Tecmo stepped down this year because poor sales for MRE almost bankrupted the company.  <BR> <BR>Tecmo has thrown hundreds of thousands of dollars at developing more MR games, and, without fail, each one has sold fewer copies than its predecessor. Investors don&#39;t want to see that their investment not only won&#39;t be earning dividends, but the principal is most likely being thrown away. They tend to leave, quickly, after the first incident. Four or five incidents later, nobody wants to invest. <BR> <BR>About the breeding issue, Tecmo won&#39;t be releasing a game &#40;if they ever release a MR game again&#41; with monsters of different genders that reproduce naturally via sex. The main MR storyline is that combining was invented by humans to get baby monsters from a source other than saucer stones. It&#39;s a main plot point that separates it from Pokemon.  <BR> <BR>As a gameplay issue, assigning genders to monsters would further limit the already restrictive combining system, and would mean that high stat parents would be around as well as the babies, making the game far too easy. &#40;of course, some of you found MR3 too difficult..&#41;

 Ah, MrMister - Lisa isn&#39;t just another gamer. She has some inside cred at Tecmo. You&#39;re choosing the wrong person to hit with a &#34;get all the facts&#34; broadside. I&#39;d listen to her over a list in a games magazine. Especially _Nintendo Power_.

 They showed a MR RPG at the Tokyo Game Show in 2004, then  <BR>never said anything ever again. Since the producer for that game,  <BR>and several of the main programmers left the company last year, I  <BR>figured it had been dropped -especially after not a word was  <BR>mentioned about it at TGS 2005. <BR> <BR>Anyway, Japan always does stuff without telling the US office  <BR>first....I know of many times when Tecmo US found things out by  <BR>reading EGM.

 I like Nintendo Power, but they tend to talk about games a little to early. Many of the games they preivew end up being cancled or moved to another system. And MR was on the list, but so was a 3D Sonic Game that allowed you to control speed with the touch pad that was scheduled for release in 2005! I&#39;ve heard nothing else about it since. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think an MR game for the DS would be cool, but I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s going to happen at all or at the least anytime soon. I&#39;d be happy if they came out with another one at all. But they&#39;re only human. and can only do so much.

 this may by a little of topic, but I think it relates... <BR> <BR>I have a question, does anyone &#40;specifically Lisa&#41; know the likelihood  of there being a new monster rancher game? if Tecmo has lost so much on it, especially EVO, why should they make another? I know about the online one, but so far thats not for US? has it been announced for US yet? will it? whats the odds? i need someone here NOT to be optimisitic NOT to be pessimistic, i need someone to be completely honest and blunt, <BR>what are the chances of MR countinuing?

Honestly, MR will probably not have another coming out. At least not soon. I have said that spreading the word will help, but I am beginning to doubt. I have told my friends, and family. Even some of my teachers. But most just don&#39;t seem interested. I do hope that, once TECMO gets money from other, more popular games&#40;like Fatel Frame&#41;in the future, then TECMO could make another. I do hope the series lasts as long as the Final Fantasy.<FONT FACE="WINGDINGS">&#74;</FONT>

 Wow Sturnum94, you really went to spread the word&#40;praising you for your work&#41;, I only told my friends. Some of them like the game, some don&#39;t. I really would be disappointed about MR being dropped and they yet to show their best on a real RPG MR game. What I feel is that they did add some cool new features on EVO, but I think they could&#39;ve done better. The circus was good but there wasn&#39;t no tournaments which that I think that alot of people still wanted on my opinion. And the attacks on my opinion was too easy to obtain the attacks for the monsters. I think if they want the game to continue, they should have suggestions of how the plot should be, attacks that fans love, the way of how monsters should age and some new features.

 Is Tecmo a developer and publisher?  Because if they are both can they merge with a publishing company and just continue to be devlopers with some other japense company publishing their games so they wouldn&#39;t lose as much money?  Or is no one willing to have their failing company as a partner? <BR> <BR>I believe that a factor to their failing sales is distribution and adverertising.  I have had PSX for about 8 yrs and GBA 3 yrs ago and never heard of the series until visiting Gamespot&#39;s Greatest lists.  The game sounded fun so I bought it.  There are so many creature/monster geeks out there willing to buy pokemon rehashes every release so you would think more ppl would try out rancher unless like me before they never heard of the series.
