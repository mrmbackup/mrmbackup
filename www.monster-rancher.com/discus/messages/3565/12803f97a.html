According to Shonen Jump magazine, Tecmo is indeed working on MR5 for the Playstation... 2! It shall be titled &#34;Monster Rancher 5: Circus Caravan&#34; and will be released in Japan by the end of the year. <BR> <BR>For more information, I refer you to the following article: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/07/13/news_6128968.html" TARGET="_blank">http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/07/13/news_6128968.html</A>

 &#34;As the game&#39;s festive subtitle suggests, Monster Farm 5 will have a focus on music, dancing, and performances. Early illustrations from the game show Julio playing an accordion, Nayuta swinging on a high acrobatic ladder, and a Mocchi monster juggling balls in the air.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Ack.. Hopefully it&#39;s better than what it sounds. :&#40;

<I>&#34;Circus Caravan will play instead more like a traditional role-playing game. The series&#39; trademark monster-breeding aspect will be retained, as players will be able to generate companion monsters for their journeys from any CD or DVD.&#34;</I> <BR> <BR>Yeah, we will see how this turns out. My guess is that low sales have made them think that maybe going into an established format might sell more games. I personally could do without controlling a character in the game. I like being me.

 Personally, I&#39;m significantly annoyed. Of course, it&#39;s still too early to judge. <BR> <BR>I sincerely hope they go back to the original format upon moving to the next-gen consoles.

 you would think that if MR2 was thier most popular game and every time they move twords an &#34;rpg&#34; style game thier sales drop they would figure out that going back to the MR2 style would be a better move. <BR>With that being said I actually am somewhat intrested in how they make MR5.  Although it really could go either way.

 If it&#39;s really raising a circus freak, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll even buy the game. <BR> <BR>What I really want is just a mr2 with more monsters &#62;_&#62;

 Would it still involve battles?&#40;the main point of monster rancher pretty much&#41;, because it doesnt seem that battling is needed in a circus... and then the stat gains wouldn&#39;t matter, unless the stats are like: &#34;balance&#34;, &#34;juggle&#34;, &#34;flexability&#34; and such...???

 I highly doubt they&#39;d go that far. Tecmo&#39;s trying to bring new people into the series, not alienate everyone, in spite of the apparent premise. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s almost completely certain that battles will be an important part of MR5. It wouldn&#39;t make any sense otherwise.

 I want to be happy about this game, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll be disappointed by it as MR3 and 4 really let me down &#40;Too gimmicky with the Apes and the horrendous GameProbot translation, annoying characters, etc.&#41;.  If they can fix some of the features &#40;counter-attacks that don&#39;t kill battles, a combination system that is like MRA1&#43;2&#39;s but better, likeable breeds&#42;, longer lifespan, and a MUCH better translation&#41; I&#39;ll be looking forward to the game. <BR> <BR>Not to be Negative Nancy, but I&#39;m not raising my hopes with this game like I did in the past. <BR> <BR>&#42;Most of the recent breeds like Garu, that Armadillo-thingy, and Ripper just aren&#39;t likable; but then again I liked the MR1&#43;2 breeds better than any of the ones from 3&#43;4 although Raiden, Gitan, Mogi, and Zan are the only good ones from the last two.

 As for the mechanics/gameplay, if it plays like Dragon Warrior Monsters 1 &#43; 2 where your critters are capped from their age, and you breed them for better critters it might work as long as it still plays like MR instead of &#34;terrible, cliched-Japanese console RPG game&#34;; however, if it&#39;s going to be like Digimon World where the awfulness gives Digimon World a run for it&#39;s money I can only hope the series will finally rest in peace &#40;The Digimon World games have been nothing, but failures&#41;.  Sorry that I forgot to add this to my last post.

 well gizmo, I have to diagree with you on one point.  Lesione and Ogyo are by and far the best new monsters from MR3.  Mogi was just beyond annoying and Zan, well just over rated.

 I definitely won&#39;t disagree with the fact that Zan was VERY overrated &#40;It was pretty strong though&#41;, but as much it looked like it came from a &#34;cliche anime&#34;, it seemed to fit into the series more than Ocotopi, Garu, or even Antlan.  Mogi might have been annoying, but I thought it was a pretty good breed in MR3 and the MRA games &#40;Mogi had a nice Gut drain that was helpful, but it&#39;s been a while since I played MRA1&#43;2&#41;.  I can&#39;t comment on MR4 Mogis though. <BR> <BR>I wanted to like Ogyo and Lesione, but they were meh to me when I used them in 3 and the GBA games&#42; &#40;A Loch Ness monster was definitely a cool idea&#41;.  Maybe when I replay MRA1 I&#39;ll try to raise a Lesione. <BR> <BR>&#42;The rare, MRA1 Lesione you get from fighting the Rogue Lesi is a joke gone horribly wrong.
