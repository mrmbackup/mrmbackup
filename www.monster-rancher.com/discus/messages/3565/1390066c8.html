 I have noticed that there are people who got disappointed when their personal favorite got removed from the game. In this thread, please tell the monster you want back and want removed. <BR> <BR>Mine <BR> <BR>back: color pandoras, hoppers, galis and ghosts <BR>removed: &#40;no offense to the fans of these monsters&#41; garu, antlan, raiden, that roller thing

 Yeah, I hate all those same breeds.  I also wish they&#39;d bring back some previous rares just in terms of aesthetics, Muu being at the top of that list &#62;_&#62;

 The Breed I miss the most, was the Gali, it was so cool as a sub-breed!  I also Dearly miss the Worm, and I always Liked Arrowhead, and the great Gaboo. <BR>I could Do without rhino-rollers, Garu, Plant, and the one I PERSONALLY have always wished would go to oblivion... the Mocchi, no offense, I&#39;m sure they are great, but you know...

 I so miss Galis and Worms too. Also, I wish they&#39;d retrograde Pixie back to when it could shoot flames and lightning bolts and stuff &#40;SO MUCH BETTER&#41;. It seems to me like all the monsters have been moving way more towards POW techs too. What&#39;s wrong with INT techs? Personally, Mews could go far away and Ducken could swiftly follow.

 Want back: gali, monol, scribble, undine&#40;personally liked undines&#41;, Momo/Kato, clown-faded joker from MR2&#40;instead of the more evil looking one, personally the actual JOKER face was more evil to me&#41; <BR>Dislike: rhinorollers, gitans, antlans, garu, mocchi, lesiones, pancho&#40;eh&#41;, raiden, mogi, suzurin, maya.  <BR> <BR>Getting rid of the Gali was kind of annoying because they always seemed to be paired with Joker, and seemed to be fairly staple. <BR>I don&#39;t know how you don&#39;t like duckens. I like duckens; they have the silliest emotes/techs that are just fun to watch. <BR>I also dislike how Mews turned into a cat that wanted to sing, where I liked before when they were just stuffed animals.

 Wow, I hate Katos so much.  But the picture of the Blue Kato on the card was awesome, nonetheless.  I want all of the monsters back from numbers 1 &amp; 2 except for Hopper and Mocchi.  I don&#39;t like them, haha.  I really miss Doodle though.

 Want Back: Monols, Kato, Worms,Arrow heads, MR2 Henger subs&#40;i.e. golem/henger,ect.&#41;, hopper, mock, MR2 Naga, Mew, and Joker, Pixie <BR>Out: Momo, Pancho, Ogyo, Gitan, Mogi, Maya. <BR>I hate most of the new monster looks if you can&#39;t tell. The only good new one is Durahan and they left out Hercules&#40;Durahan/Beaclon&#41;

 Like: Undine, MR2 Henger, Gali <BR>Dislike: Maya, Rhinoroller <BR> <BR>Honestly, Hengers look ridiculous in the newer games. They were soooo much cooler as Transformers rip-offs x3

 Actually, Gali, Monol and Centuar came back <BR>in MFDS2 if you don&#39;t already know. <BR> <BR>But I really want the Wrackys, Ghosts, Doodles, <BR>Disks, Gaboos, Magics, Worms and Zillas back. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t want any other breeds removed though, <BR>I like my Psiroller and Pancho :&#40;

 I want these guys back: <BR>Zuum or Dino &#40;or both&#41; <BR>The original Joker that was actually quite creepy <BR>WORMS. Beaclons are not enough. <BR>DOODLES. <BR>Ghosts. They&#39;re too cute. <BR>Zillas for great justice. <BR> <BR>I want these things out: <BR>The counter that goes down when you reset the game  <BR>without saving &#40;MRDS2&#41;. I want to play however the  <BR>hell I want to play it, not follow &#39;your monster  <BR>failed to learn a skill after 10 Drills. Live with  <BR>it&#39;. <BR>I don&#39;t really want Baku out, they&#39;re cute, but  <BR>there&#39;s something that makes me dislike raising  <BR>them.
