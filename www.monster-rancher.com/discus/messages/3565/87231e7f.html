ooo oooo.. Slating Monsters from games as players or mascots, or referees, coaches. cameos etc. <BR>^_~ <BR> <BR>also.. Different Team Coaches might give your team &#34;charactaristics&#34; or advantages/disadvantages based on the coach you choose for your team.

 Hehehe... that&#39;s not a bad concept Fenrick. <BR> <BR>Every monster should be able to play every position, just certain stats effect how well they play that position, and their stats go up after every game, the more they play, the more their stats go up.  However, there&#39;s a fatigue bar, and when a monster&#39;s fatigue bar is high, there&#39;s more of a chance he&#39;ll get injured, and his stats will go down after the game.

 &#34;HR&#42;83: unless.....the mascot determines their sub...if that makes sense  <BR>HR&#42;83: like, &#34;The Tigers&#34; would all be sub tigers  <BR>HR&#42;83: that way every team doesn&#39;t look the same...it would be like their sub is their jersey  <BR>HR&#42;83: and of course your choice would have a small &#40;or large&#41; impact on how your team develops  <BR>HR&#42;83: &#40;aka, stat gains&#41;  <BR> <BR>idea taken from chat.
