 Well last night I finally managed to get my girlfriend to play one of the MR games. I lured her in with the Pixies. She started playing MRA2 and 4 hours later her Mint had run it&#39;s course and she was B level. Not bad for her never having played any of the games before. She didn&#39;t realize it had been 4 hours, she thought it had been an hour. I think she&#39;s addicted now. Nothin like bein an MR pusher. &#42;L&#42; Hopefully this doesn&#39;t make it so I don&#39;t ever get to play.

 Ah, there&#39;s the rub: Everybody wants their girlfriend to be into video games. To share the wonderful pixilated experience with the one you currently love.  <BR> <BR>But if you succeed: She&#39;s INTO video games. And guess who&#39;ll be playing MR for the next few weeks... Not you, buddy! She won&#39;t complain about you playing the games anymore, because you WON&#39;T be. She will.  <BR> <BR>Come to think of it, my girlfriend has been looking over my shoulder lately while I play. Better not start a Mew...

 The key is to play only masculine monsters, like Durahans, Beaklons, Jokers, and the like. Of course, I&#39;d rather not play than get chewed out by my girlfriend.

 It&#39;s a good thing she works all day and I have time to play. Besides yeah I&#39;d like her to be into stuff I am, but who knows if I&#39;ll stay with her. As long as she&#39;s with me she&#39;ll be monster ranching. She finished her second monster tonight. She finished it as S level with 70 wins and 8 losses. All her wins were knockouts and she only had 2 techniques with this Pixie. It blew my mind. How does someone who&#39;s never played before make it to S level with only 2 techniques and lose that few of times. Whatever works &#42;L&#42;. She&#39;s mad at me. My old buddy is here on army leave and she&#39;s in a bad mood. Good thing Monster Rancher kept her happy. &#42;L&#42;

 few know this.. but.. My wife beat MR1 before I ever did.. &#40;and she never lives it down either&#41; she&#39;s the one who got me back into it.. which led to me finding out about MRM, in which Lisa encouranged me to do Tournaments, hence Legendcup was born. <BR>:&#41;

 hey, I love Beaclon, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a masculine monster, I think it&#39;s adorable! <BR>when I get the game, I&#39;m going to use that one as soon as I can get one from worm! <BR>But I don&#39;t like Durahan..... Or Arrowhead for that matter, I think you&#39;d be better off with those.

 Poor arrowheads... no respect, I tell ya... <BR> <BR>Wow, maybe it&#39;s a good idea to get your girl into the game. Monster Fenrick&#39;s revelation makes me see how important your S.O. can be. To think, if not for Mrs. Fenrick, there would be no Legendcup! <BR>The Horror! <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;ll turn my girl onto the game once I start losing interest in it. Maybe I&#39;ll end up starting my own site, too...

 but for my daughter, i would not be here either. <BR> <BR>for whatever reason, there have been more women and girls playing monster rancher games than most other console games.  and too many of them to mention have made significant contributions to our knowledge of the games, both at this site and others.  all hail females!
