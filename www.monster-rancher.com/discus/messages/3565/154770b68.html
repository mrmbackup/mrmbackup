 He so often denies me victory.. so I have to attempt it again later.. only to fall to a lucky hit from him again. XD <BR> <BR>&#40;If you don&#39;t know he&#39;s the pure Mew who likes winning the Official Grade E Cup so at least for me ends up being my last opponent&#41;

 Each of the official cups has a story-based final opponent.  Katz is Rank E.  For Rank D, expect a clone of your monster only with more techs. <BR> <BR> Even after the story has been completed, the rival will still be in every official cup.

 I don&#39;t even attempt to beat a tournament until I have at least 300 in the tech stat that I want &#40;Pow or Int&#41; and 200 in everything else. It makes it incredibly easy to blow past Katz all the way to rank c where you will no longer see him. I always lost to him as well, so I figured this was the best plan.

 Yeah, Katz handed me two or my 3 career losses. To be fair, in the first fight I was still a little unsure about the controls. The second fight he just plain got lucky. But that&#39;s the kind of lump you have to take when you cant really save before going into battle.

 Can&#39;t imagine how poor your stats are to lose to him like that.  My starting monster beat him in the official E cup with no training at all.  &#40;Twice, no less, since I started over.&#41;

 He always hits me with his scratch, even if I try to avoid getting in close range. Yes, his scratch does not have a very good to hit chance, but he seems to hit me almost every time. <BR> <BR>Then was the match where I only had one poor accuracy attack. I missed every single time. He hit me once with Zap for 1 point. Ugh.

 Well in the first battle I had almost basically starting stats, since he challenges you to a tourney almost as soon as you step on to the ranch. And, as I said, I was still getting the hang of the controls, so I lost without ever managing to hit him, while he hit me once. <BR> <BR>The second time I had 300 skill, 200 power and speed, and everything else at or around 100, and he just plain got lucky, hit me one time, and dodged every single attack I launched.

 You do know about using Defense slots right? <BR> <BR>  Leave a spot open in your tech deck in the close range.  Whenever you are not attacking, switch to the blank spot.  Your opponent has 1/3 lower chance to hit you when you are in an empty slot. <BR> <BR>  I never carry more than 3 techs with me.  Leaving a spot open at every range gives a great defense.

 I know that. I didnt the first time, but I did the second time. He just plain got lucky. His chance to hit was like 22% or something, but he hit anyway. And my 68-78% just kept missing.
