<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'gm'-!>
This is absolutely incredible. <BR> <BR>I just tried regenerating monsters in MR2 using The Three Stooges Collection Volume 1, and I got a Liquid Cube &#40;KP/Jell&#41;. To make sure it wasn&#39;t a fluke, I tried out MR3. It worked, too. I went on to test several video DVDs and PS2 games, and they all got me different monsters. I haven&#39;t documented them, unfortunately, but I plan on doing so as soon as possible. For what it&#39;s worth, a few of the monsters I recall are Hachiro &#40;Zuum/Baku&#41;, Gaboo and Tombstone &#40;Joker/Golem&#41;, the latter which I&#39;ve never obtained from any CD before. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still screwing around with this, but I think I can safely say that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, Monster Rancher 2 can regenerate monsters from DVDs when playing the game on PS3. <BR> <BR>However, unlike MR4, XBox 360 games yield only pure Gaboo with identical stats &#40;mind, the Gaboo I got from one of my DVDs had different stats, so it was legit&#41;.  <BR> <BR>More surprisingly, I tried out the two PS3 games I had on hand, and they gave two different monsters, Scaled Plant &#40;Plant/Zuum&#41; and Granity &#40;Pixie/Golem&#41;. A friend of mine with a PS3 tested it out with his copy of Oblivion and got a Hachiro. I can&#39;t test it extensively until I return to university, where all my other PS3 games are, but at the very least, these Blu-Ray games worked just like any normal CD in the shrine in MR2. <BR> <BR>PC CDs definitely check out with MR2. <BR> <BR>MR1, on the other hand, got me some pretty bizarre results. DVDs certainly work with it, but strangely enough, I&#39;ve gotten nothing but pure breeds. Not just one specific one, either. I&#39;ve gotten Golem, Tiger, Gali, Jell, Worm, etc. and they&#39;re all pure. However, Dino seems to stand out. Every PS2 game I&#39;ve tried got me Dino, barring one which got me Monol &#40;Katamari Damacy&#41;. Dino also popped up a few times with some DVD movies, including four out of six of my Black Adder Collection discs. I haven&#39;t tried many 360 games yet, but thus far they all give Dino. The two PS3 games got me Worm and Dino. <BR> <BR>Both games dislike Wii discs. <BR> <BR>To note, I used the discontinued 80GB PS3 with software emulation for older titles. I will be able to confirm as to whether they will work on my non-emulated PS3 when I return to university, and if so, whether or not the results are the same as those obtained from the other one.

 The MR1 results indicate that whatever the PS3 is reading off the DVDs, it&#39;s just one track. Sinlge track CDs make pures in MR1.

 Hey, you&#39;re right. That makes sense. But doesn&#39;t it hold true for every MR game, on the PSX at least? <BR> <BR>In case anyone&#39;s wondering, CDs work like they always do in both games.

 This may not be completely on topic, but how did you manage to get your PS1 memory card data on to your PS3? I bought an adapter to convert the saves over but it won&#39;t read my PS1 card. I&#39;m just asking to see if you had any problems yourself or if it&#39;s a problem with my card &#40;it is kind of old&#41;.

 Yeah, the PS3 memory adapter allows you to import your saves to &#40;and more recently, export them from&#41; your console. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also possible to convert DexDrive and X-Port/Max Drive files to PS3 virtual memory card format &#40;PSV&#41; by transferring the save to a memory card and importing it. I&#39;ve got PSV files of both complete saves for MR2 and 3, plus the incomplete MR4 save and Lisa&#39;s maxxed MR1 Golem file.

 It&#39;s only MR1 where single track discs make pures. In MR2 they can make several things, mostly gaboos and tigers, but not just pures.

 I&#39;ve also noticed this!  However, every single PS2 game and DVD I&#39;ve tried so far gave me a Hachiro &#40;Zuum/Baku&#41;, though the stats are usually different for each one.  Blu-ray discs have given me diffrernt monsters, though. <BR>Maybe I&#39;ll go through the rest of my PS2/DVD collection and hope that Hachiro doesn&#39;t pop up again at least once....

 I don&#39;t own a PS3, but I think I&#39;d buy one just to try my dvd&#39;s and such.

 Which version of the PS3 are you using? <BR> <BR>I know the 60gig version was backwards compatible right out of the box.  The 40gig version isn&#39;t backwards compatible at all.  And the 80gig is only backwards compatible if you hook it to the internet and download an update patch or something to that affect.  I&#39;ve heard that the 80gig even after the update isn&#39;t compatible with everything.  So, I was wondering which version you were using.  &#40;the 60gig isn&#39;t being made any more and the 80gig won&#39;t be re-released for a few months and only the 40gig is currently being made available&#41;.
