What if TECMO could make a game like <B>Rampage</B>. I don&#39;t think TECMO would get sued, since EVO had Final Fantasy written all over it. What if it would give it the Rampage look, while still maintaining the MR tradition. You could still get Techniques, you would advance your stats, they would even keep the sealing TECMO had in EVO. Your stats would affect how long it took you too destroy things.  <BR> <BR>POW. would obvioulsy mean the difference between a strong smashing, and a weak one.  <BR> <BR>LIF: would affect how many hits you would take to finally give up. <BR> <BR>SPD: would affect how fast you would move, and how fast you would do a tech. <BR> <BR>SKI/Accuracy: would remain the same. You would need skill to accuratly hit weak points in order to destroy anything faster. <BR> <BR>You get the point. So, I want to know if this is worth getting looked over. If anyone posts taht this is useless, and should be deleted, I want to say sorry for posting something worhtless.

 I believe U were just scolding me a week older for adding new game ideas because Tecmo has no money, cant afford it blah blah and here you come with a totally of course MR game.  I think my point is clear :p

Look, <BR>1.I didn&#39;t scold you, I merely aknowledged you. There is a difference. So:p to you. <BR> <BR>2.I know, I am not forgetful. I do realize that I &#34;aknowledged&#34; in that post. What I stated was that you posted something that always comes up. It is a topic that comes up once a year. Believe me, I have been coming to this site for years. It was only this year that I decided to become a member.  <BR> <BR>3.I never said that this would actually even have a chance of coming out as a game. This is the only place that you can post about new ideas. I am sorry of what I said. I really am, but please, just post your <I>ideas</I>.

 ok, this might sound a little mean, i don&#39;t mean for it to sound that way, but its kind of hard to communicate how you are saying something online so... <BR> <BR>just a little tip, when you&#39;re correcting someone you might want to spell corectly. <BR>its acknowledged. not aknowledged. <BR> <BR> <BR>btw i spelled correctly, &#34;corectly&#34; as a joke. hahaha
