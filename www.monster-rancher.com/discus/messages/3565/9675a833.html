I got the idea from the &#34;How To Raise a Collage Student Using MR2 methodology&#34; topic from the year 2000 archived topics,in case you were wondering. This is somewhat differant because I&#39;ve added/taken away some factors. So without further ado... <BR> <BR>Main types of teens: <BR>Understanding:Tends to have the &#34;patient&#34; characteristic,sees reasoning behind most actions <BR>Laid-Back&#40;AKA Lazy&#41;:Teen doesn&#39;t like to work much unless paired with a &#34;Hardworker&#34; sub-type,in wihc case the teen will perform better overall. Tends to have the &#34;laid-back&#34; attribute&#40;duh&#41; <BR>Hardworker:Teen tends to work hard, but will sometimes refuse to rest in order to get work done. Worls best with &#34;laid-back&#34; subtype <BR>Self-absorbed:Teen only cares about itself and its appearance, tends to have the &#34;mall zombie&#34; attribute&#40;loves to buy things without telling you&#41; <BR>Doormat:Teen only cares about others and making them happy. Tends to have the &#34;servant&#34; attribute.&#40;Teen goes out of its way to do what you ask&#41; <BR> <BR><U>Raising Factors</U> <BR>There are 2 main factors to consider when raising your teen:Happiness&#40;how happy your teen is with its life&#41; and Trust&#40;how much your teen trusts you&#41;. At first Happiness will be so-so and Trust will be 0. A happy teen will perform better and gains Trust faster, and a teen that trusts you will be more willing to do what you say. Here&#39;s how to calculate Trust and Happiness: <BR> <BR><U>Happiness</U> <BR>There are 4 factors that effect Happiness:Content,Happiness&#40;seperate from the main Happiness rating&#41;,Boredom,and Unhappiness,with each value able to go up to 100. To work out your teen&#39;s main Happiness rating, the following formula is used: <BR>&#40;Happiness-Unhappiness&#43;Content&#41;/Boredom <BR>As you can see,it is very hard for a Bored/Unhappy teen to be happy. <BR> <BR><U>Trust</U> <BR>There are 3 main factors in Trust:How much you take your teen&#39;s likes and dislikes into consideration,how happy it is, and how often you let your teen get hurt/sick&#40;they all go up to 100&#41;. Trust increase each week if you&#39;re doing everything right and decreases if you&#39;re on the wrong track. Trust is calculated as follows: <BR>Happiness&#43;# of liked actions taken on teen&#40;feeding/giving an item that is liked, doing it&#39;s favorite drills,etc.&#41;-&#40;Frequencty of injuries/sickness&#43;# of disliked actions taken on teen&#41; <BR>If the number is positve, you will gaint Trust. If negitive, you will lose Trust. <BR> <BR>My Stats: <BR>Lif=300&#40;I&#39;m average in endurance&#41; <BR>Pow=750&#40;I&#39;m MUCH stronger than I look&#41; <BR>Int=999&#40;if my brain size was proportional to my intelligance, it&#39;d weigh about 300 pounds!&#41; <BR>Ski=600&#40;I&#39;m very accurate at everything&#41; <BR>Spd=650&#40;It goes down temporarily if I run for too long&#41; <BR>Def=50&#40;except for my bones.
