 Since most major game franchises will eventually  <BR>see some sort of remake of past games, I think  <BR>Monster Rancher could have one.  It wouldn&#39;t take  <BR>as much effort as a full on new game but could  <BR>have potential to be awesome. I&#39;m not talking  <BR>&#34;port the game to PSP and we&#39;re done&#34;. I&#39;m  <BR>thinking this game being to Monster Rancher 2 what  <BR>Heart Gold and Soul Silver was to Pokemon Gold and  <BR>Silver Version. An awesome revisit to a great  <BR>game, but even better. As much of a tribute as it  <BR>is a remake. <BR> <BR>Most of us can agree that Monster Rancher 2 is one  <BR>of if not the best game in the series, but it is  <BR>rather dated and new features have been added to  <BR>the series since then, some good &#40;nutrition, 4&#39;s  <BR>battle system, the ability to raise multiple  <BR>monsters&#41;, some bad &#40;circuses, DS&#39;s battle system&#41;  <BR> <BR>I think it would be cool if we could see Monster  <BR>Rancher 2 remade for a newer generation. It&#39;ll be  <BR>the same game we love, but even better. It&#39;ll have  <BR>modern graphics and some features from the new  <BR>games like the newer battle system &#40;the battle  <BR>system in 2 being one of the game&#39;s fatal flaws,  <BR>imo&#41;, a better translation &#40;no more &#34;I wonder it  <BR>buds the flower&#34;&#41;, new animations, remeasters and  <BR>arranges of the music, etc.  <BR> <BR>I do not want it changed too much, so I think only  <BR>one monster should be able to be raised at a time.  <BR>I think if you raise only one monster, you become  <BR>much more attached to it since it&#39;s all you got  <BR>and you give it ALL of your attention.   <BR>Some ideas of new enhancements besides just  <BR>graphics enhancements and  <BR>battlesystembattlesystembattle system could  <BR>include more varied monster personalities like in  <BR>the later games, but unlike the later games the  <BR>personalities will really show by how they act.  <BR>They could even go as far as giving monsters  <BR>different animations depending on their  <BR>temperament or personality! Wouldn&#39;t that be cool?  <BR> <BR>Because newer technology is used, there could be a  <BR>lot more variation for how the monster subspecies  <BR>look. I think they could also add some new food  <BR>and items with different effects, but nothing that  <BR>would change the core gameplay. Maybe there could  <BR>be new expedition locations. <BR> <BR>The monster roster will be the same, but maybe  <BR>they could add some of the more popular newer  <BR>monsters into the game somehow, to give people  <BR>more of a reason to give it a look. I certainly  <BR>wouldn&#39;t mind being able to raise rippers and  <BR>Antlans in MR2!

 I think everyone here agrees that a MR2 remake would  <BR>be amazing. <BR> <BR>Another thing to add would be more difficult  <BR>tournaments, because there is a point in MR2 were  <BR>you just roll over everything, and its not very  <BR>challenging to get a monster to that point.

 Totally agreed. I would think that it&#39;d be a smart  <BR>move for Tecmo and surprised it hasn&#39;t happened yet,  <BR>or even been considered. It&#39;d be amazing if Tecmo  <BR>did this, and would totally revive the series imo.

 I think the issue is that the lead developer behind MR2 left the company before MR3 was created and everything since has been made by different people. That said, MRA2 is a pretty good and complex game. Of course it was created by someone who isn&#39;t with Tecmo anymore, either...

 I love MR2, it&#39;s my favourite game in the series of the ones I&#39;ve played &#40;1 through 4, and both GBA games&#41;, but something I really like about the series is that they don&#39;t just do the same thing over and over. Even though the core of the game &#40;raise monsters, win battles, become a master&#41; is always the same, they change the regions, monsters, characters, plot, unlock methods, and so on, so each game feels new and unique but also still familiar.  <BR> <BR>An MR2 Remake with new monsters and updated mechanics and battles would be interesting, but I would prefer they just have a new game set in the same region chronologically linked to MR2 instead. That way they could have a few homages to MR2 - eg. a cup where you can fight Most again, a couple familiar enemies, like having Oakleyman &#40;the E-rank Gaboo/Gaboo&#41; be a Major 4 monster to show that it&#39;s the same setting but that time has passed. It gives a lot of nostalgia, but it&#39;s still a new experience. <BR> <BR>I would really love to have a few things from MR2 back, though - I miss the old Jokers, in MR2 they were my favourite monster, but in the games since they lost their &#34;Demon Clown&#34; aspect, so I&#39;ve just lost interest in them and went back to being a Suezo and Naga lover. Probably the thing I miss most from MR2 was how natures and natured techs were done. <BR> <BR>If Tecmo &#42;does&#42; go the remake route, then MR2 is probably the best one they could remake though - it&#39;s old enough that a new generation of ranchers may not have gotten to play it, but it&#39;s loved by old-timers as well, and it has a lot of room to be improved through small things like updating the 3D models, using new raising mechanics &#40;so we would need to come up with new methods and such&#41;, fixing a couple things &#40;Swim drills, the translation&#41;, revamping the combat, and making expeditions more interactive.

 I think the first step towards any sort of remake would actually be to get the games up on PSN/Live/Nintendo&#39;s online thing. I&#39;m not sure, but I think this would come with its own technical hurdles in having the game function properly; specifically those involved with disc regeneration. <BR> <BR>Remake or not, I&#39;d just like to see a traditional, properly constructed Monster Rancher game around again. I&#39;m just not sure where its place is in the market.

 Oh man I&#39;d love to see this. MR2 is indeed the best of the MR games. <BR> <BR>Coincidentally I was just daydreaming of raising a Ripper in IMa and having it battle in the Major 4 arena with the Major 4 battle music playing in my head! <BR> <BR>I really wanna raise Rippers and Ogyos with the MR2 setting. I really do...

 Has anyone contacted Tecmo lately, like an email or  <BR>letter? The Tecmoinc website is blocked by chrome  <BR>for me saying there is malware ahead lol, i&#39;m not  <BR>sure if TecmoKoie is the new site. I just wanna hear  <BR>their input and opinion on making a monster rancher  <BR>2 remake or a new monster rancher with similar  <BR>gameplay.

 I was just thinking about this very idea today while playing! I&#39;ve never -personally- played anything after MR 2, but I know it&#39;s at least generally accepted among fans as the greatest MR game despite its numerous glitches and such... A remake could have everything that made it so great way back when, while bostering it up with all the real improvements of the later games. Personally I&#39;d like to see more storage space in the Lab&#40;though I&#39;m sure the new games addressed this somehow&#41;, especially if every breed from every game was made available! I know some of them are really cool! I think a difficulty setting chosen at the beginning of the file would be a good idea. One for a first-time rancher, a &#39;normal&#39; one, and a veteran difficulty for us old-timers. A much wider variety of enemy monsters in tourneys would be nice. Like a large pool for each class that they&#39;re chosen from, and a wider variety in general would be really cool. Going up against Beaclons and Metalners and the like. I also really like the idea of Oakleyman being in the Major 4...  <BR>I guess all we can do is sit here and dream about it?... This is definitely number 1 on my remake wishlist. We can hope!

 The producer of MR2 left Tecmo over ten years ago. Any new games would have the imprint of a new producer on them, just like Mr3 was very different because new people took over after he left. And, since all of the sequels have had lousy sales figures, especially MR5 which caused the company&#39;s reorganization and the MR-friendly president to resign, it&#39;s not an easy task. The game is view as a game for little children, and doesn&#39;t produce much  revenue, so, it doesn&#39;t get much attention.
