So apparently Tecmo has very recently announced that they&#39;ll be localizing Monster Rancher DS in March 2010. Here&#39;s a link!  <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.destructoid.com/tecmo-s-again-and-monster-rancher-ds-coming-march-2010-154734.phtml" TARGET="_blank">http://www.destructoid.com/tecmo-s-again-and-monster-rancher-ds-coming-march-2010-154734.phtml</A> <BR> <BR>Credit for the find goes to someone from a board I frequent.

 Sifting through the screenshots on Joystiq, I managed to find out a few things: <BR> <BR>-The game is definitely a localization of MFDS2.  <BR> <BR>-BOMBA stands for Borgan Monster Battle Academy, presumably Association also. <BR> <BR>-The assistant&#39;s English name is Cleo. <BR> <BR>-The lab admin&#39;s English name is Pharma. <BR> <BR>-Abisu&#39;s English name is Abyss. <BR> <BR>-The monster count is the same, 272. <BR> <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t remember off-hand, but are those book entries the same as the ones in MR4 or Evo?

 that&#39;s great. Do you know why. It means we Americans finally get to work for Ms. Claire. Thanks for deleting my posts, Lisa, because they were false anyway. They were coming from my friend at school. I&#39;ll refresh him on the situation. Soon, Ms.Claire, you&#39;ll have me and my sister to work with. Remember this, BOMBA  stands for &#34;Borgon Monster Battle Academy.&#34; The lab lady&#39;s name is Pharma. I don&#39;t know the meanie&#39;s name, because the screenshots call him Cleo. I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s referring to Claire, or the Monster in the screenshot.

 Yes, you&#39;ll be able to play via DS online pretty much anytime you want, granting that someone else is online to play against you. And, there&#39;s local wifi play as well. &#40;IIRC, you need to be within 200 feet of the other player for local wifi to work&#41;

 I am thinking that chat would actually be a good way to meet up with opponents in advance. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not quite certain about letting people post friend codes on the board. It seems like a good idea, but, then, they will still be there 6 months later...

Plenty of video game message boards already do this, so it couldn&#39;t hurt to give it a try.  <BR> <BR>We could always make a temp thread in the MRDS section where people could post their FCs then copy them to a more permanent location. Members could also post personal updates in that thread if their codes changed for whatever reason. <BR> <BR>A matchmaking thread would probably be too taxing and costly, so the chatroom would be the best place for people to meet up and organize battles.

 I guess I need to keep an eye out for sales on any model of Nintendo DS &#40;I occasionally see DS Lites for $100&#41;. I&#39;m not going to rush out and grab one, but if I see a price I can&#39;t refuse, this game looks like it would make it worth while. <BR> <BR>Judging from the screen shots, it looks like a lot of the best MR elements are there &#40;and also that the graphics might be a little choppy, but that&#39;s not why I play MR&#41;.

 I&#39;ve played a DS, so I know what it can do; and I&#39;ve seen better looking screen shots than that. What I was getting at, though, is that how good the screen shots &#40;or even the game to an extent - so long as it doesn&#39;t hurt my eyes&#41; look isn&#39;t a big deal. I&#39;d still rather play MR2 and MRA2 over anything else right now, and they&#39;re not the sexiest games by current standards. <BR> <BR>Also, I didn&#39;t know that the DSi could make any significant difference. I haven&#39;t been keeping up on it. That the DSi XL is scheduled for Q1 in NA leads me to believe that the DSi will see a price drop though, so that could be fortunate.

 There are only a handful of DSi-exclusive games out right now, most of them in Japan. Since games that use DSi&#39;s exclusive features can&#39;t be played on a normal DS, I doubt they&#39;ll change much.

 The release dates in the system work like this: If it says it&#39;s coming out on the 1st of the month, then it&#39;s always a guess. It says Feb 1, 2010 which means Gamestop is guessing for Feb release, but I&#39;d stick to the March release date that is stated by all the sources in this thread.

 Interesting. Looks like the Canadians have different computer info. <BR> <BR>A good manager WILL take your money, they have a generic sku for pre-orders without a sku. The trick is to remind them later to convert the pre-order over when the real sku shows up in the system.

<!-/Source: 95104-!>
<!-Source: 95105-!>
Dang%2c+I+guess+I%27ll+have+to+get+a+DS+now%2e++This+is+really+cool%2e
<!-/Source: 95105-!>
<!-Source: 95106-!>
Hold+on+%2d+will+this+support+online+play%2c+aka+tournaments+that+won%27t+involve+ancient+hardware+like+the+dexdrive%3f
<!-/Source: 95106-!>
<!-Source: 95107-!>
I+am+quite+happy+about+this%2c+for+obvious+reasons%2e++Maybe+now+I+can+drag+GoldenBoy+back+into+the+MR+universe%2e
<!-/Source: 95107-!>
<!-Source: 95108-!>
MRDS+will+have+both+local+and+online+PvP+battles%2e
<!-/Source: 95108-!>
<!-Source: 95109-!>
Yes%2c+you%27ll+be+able+to+play+via+DS+online+pretty+much+anytime+you+want%2c+granting+that+someone+else+is+online+to+play+against+you%2e+And%2c+there%27s+local+wifi+play+as+well%2e+%28IIRC%2c+you+need+to+be+within+200+feet+of+the+other+player+for+local+wifi+to+work%29

Sweet%2e+%3a%29
<!-/Source: 95369-!>
<!-Source: 95370-!>
I+am+thinking+that+chat+would+actually+be+a+good+way+to+meet+up+with+opponents+in+advance%2e%0a%0aI%27m+not+quite+certain+about+letting+people+post+friend+codes+on+the+board%2e+It+seems+like+a+good+idea%2c+but%2c+then%2c+they+will+still+be+there+6+months+later%2e%2e%2e
<!-/Source: 95370-!>
<!-Source: 95371-!>
Plenty+of+video+game+message+boards+already+do+this%2c+so+it+couldn%27t+hurt+to+give+it+a+try%2e+%0a%0aWe+could+always+make+a+temp+thread+in+the+MRDS+section+where+people+could+post+their+FCs+then+copy+them+to+a+more+permanent+location%2e+Members+could+also+post+personal+updates+in+that+thread+if+their+codes+changed+for+whatever+reason%2e%0a%0aA+matchmaking+thread+would+probably+be+too+taxing+and+costly%2c+so+the+chatroom+would+be+the+best+place+for+people+to+meet+up+and+organize+battles%2e
<!-/Source: 95371-!>
<!-Source: 95375-!>
I+guess+I+need+to+keep+an+eye+out+for+sales+on+any+model+of+Nintendo+DS+%28I+occasionally+see+DS+Lites+for+%24100%29%2e+I%27m+not+going+to+rush+out+and+grab+one%2c+but+if+I+see+a+price+I+can%27t+refuse%2c+this+game+looks+like+it+would+make+it+worth+while%2e%0a%0aJudging+from+the+screen+shots%2c+it+looks+like+a+lot+of+the+best+MR+elements+are+there+%28and+also+that+the+graphics+might+be+a+little+choppy%2c+but+that%27s+not+why+I+play+MR%29%2e
