 This probably doesn&#39;t come close, but I had a Mint named Sprite.  With her speed and intelligence, I liked the Sprite in her!  I also have a Ghost named Buster &#40;self-explanatory&#41;, and a Scaled Hare named Sprink, which is the sound it made.

 I have a Ducken/Suezo named &#34;Panic,&#34; because that looks like its emotional state all of the time &#40;and it has moves like Frantic Beam...&#41;.  I chuckle every time I take it out of the freezer.  &#34;Let&#39;s work hard to raise Panic!&#34;

My roommate named his Golem/Arrowhead &#34;Garg&#34;... it was rather funny after an errantry, as the thing would return and Colt would exclaim &#34;Great Garg!&#34; <BR> <BR>I liked &#34;Squighound&#34; for my Datonare &#40;Tiger/Zuum&#41;... this is a joke that any Warhammer 40K players will understand when they hear that I play an Ork army... I was also fond of the name &#34;Spaz&#34; for a hopper... and as for &#34;Caine,&#34; my roommate actually named his Durahan/Joker that after I advised it a couple months back... <BR> <BR>and Locke, I recognized &#34;Shazam,&#34; too.  I had a couple of those books when I was like 5... <BR>PezCat <BR>

 Pez, I may be wrong, but something tells me you&#39;re thinking of Captain Marvel, DC&#39;s hero that yelled &#34;Shazam&#34;.  I&#39;m going a bit further back, there used to be a Saturday cartoon in the mid-60&#39;s with a brother and sister stuck in an Arabian Nights sort of situation.  They had a mighy Genie as a friend, and called him by putting together two rings that spelled Shazam when joined.  As far as my Bajarl turned out, it was definitely wishful thinking, but I really didn&#39;t give him a fair chance.

 Lesse here... um, Babididiliest or was it Babidiliest? Oh well. I just know that it took up all the spaces. <BR> <BR>Of course we can&#39;t forget the mighty A. I had to breed a worm to get beaclon, and at best it was only 2%. I had failed so much and was so used to just typing A and reloading, i accendentally named the worm A! so, instead of spending another half hour getting a new one, i just kept it! Then it hatched into a Beaclon and got to A class.

 I had a Corone named A and a Noble Saurian named A at the same time.  And when i killed a monster to get the mock, i named it Dead.  Hehe, &#34;Lets do our best to raise Dead!&#34;  Hehe....  Hmmm.....  Well this doesn&#39;t involve a monster, but my bro started a new game and named himself &#34;I&#39;m an <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>&#34; and you know how Pabs comes to meet you after you go to the ranch?  It was so funny!  Colt said &#34;I&#39;m an <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>, this is Master Pabs&#34; and then he said &#34;I&#39;m an <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>... I&#39;m Pabs&#34;!!!!! Hehe... <BR>Oh yeah, and when my bro killed a monster for the mock, he named it &#34;My Big <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>&#34;.  My favorite two quotes...  &#34;Let&#39;s do our best to raise My Big <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>!&#34;  and &#34;What&#39;s wrong?  My Big <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT>!!!!&#34;  Hehe.  On my origanal game &#40;you have no idea how many times I&#39;ve had my files accidently erased&#41; when I got the mock, my monster was named NO!  And it waz likem  &#34;What&#39;s wrong?  NO!!!!!&#34;  Hmm... and I had a Hachiro named Fu, and on his birthday it was like &#34;Happy birthday F &#42;pause&#42; u!&#34; <BR>Get it? Fu?  F you?  Hehe.

 My fiance and I went through a period of time where we named monsters based on the raunchiest thing we thought we could make Colt say.  Much like the above mentioned A&#42;&#42;.  Pretty funny until my little nephew wanted to play and I forgot about some of the crude names I had.  Oh well he listens well and just wanted a few explainations, and me being the good responsible uncle I am told him what they meant along with the threat that if he ever repeated them and ratted me out, I&#39;d beat him to a bloody pulp.

 I tend to use the album, band or song title for naming monsters, to make it easier to remember what disc they came from, and then when naming a new monster, I&#39;ll combine words from the parents or grandparent&#39;s names...Sometimes I get creative so that a name I like will fit, like Strych9 Kiss. <BR>My original joker was made combining Johnny Cash- Murder, a pink eye I named &#34;Cocaine Blues&#34; with a clear suezo, off of the Robert Johnson box set, named &#34;Devil Blues&#34;, so I got &#34;Devil Cocaine&#34;, and now &#34;Devil Mayhem&#34;.  I also had a centaur named &#34;Spasm Sam&#34;, from Skinny Puppy and Bauhaus.  <BR>And I had a tropical ape named &#34;RapeN&#39;Honey&#34; from Ministry&#39;s &#34;Land of Rape and Honey&#34; which I combined with a monol off a X-mas cd, making &#34;RapeN&#39;Xmas&#34;. I have an odd sense of humor.

 In MR1, right after naming a monster, Holly would say &#34;will it be &#40;name here&#41;?&#41;.  I took atvantage of this by naming one of my eye jells &#34;oral or anal&#34;.  It was absolutely hilarious!

 Most of my most choice names went to monsters that had a badass main with a wimpy, effeminate sub.  Like I once had a Pink Golem named &#34;WHYGODWHY&#34;.  And, on MRA, just about anything you mix with a ducken will end up gaudy and tacky looking, and so when I got my mew/ducken to train as a coach, I named it &#34;OMFG?!&#34;. <BR> <BR>My monster names on MRA weren&#39;t ever nearly as funny as the words that I used to unlock them. <BR> <BR>On Monster Rancher 1, I never really used funny names, because my humor wasn&#39;t really as off-color then as it is now, since I was still in my bible-thumping stage.  :rolleyes:

 Wow! I can&#39;t believe how old this thread is, but it&#39;s a great read! &#40;I&#39;m new to MRM, btw&#41;. I use the same style as Debauch, who posted nearly a year ago. I tend to name my monsters after the artist or album. <BR> <BR>I crossed my Bob Marley monster with my Jimmy Buffet monster and named him &#34;Bob Buffet&#34; <BR> <BR>But my favorite was &#34;Elvis&#34; cause when he died, it was just funny to see &#34;oh no, Elvis is dead!&#34; <BR>&#40;Personally I think it&#39;s a conspiracy and my monster is still alive somewhere eating fried peanut butter sandwiches&#41;

 I name my monsters whatever seems to fit them at the time. My best name had to be for Nightshade, my BlackSaurian. I swear, monsters with good names do better in battle, I had a Cyclops named A, and I entered it in the Colart Cup, and it lost. I had a Garlant named Draconix, and it won! <BR>&#40;Ok, that&#39;s just probably the difference in stats and breed of monster, btu still.&#41; <BR>For the funniest name, I don&#39;t know, I love my Wood Saurian named Stick.

And it really turned into a Beaclon named Pretty Fly!!! <BR> <BR>Then I wanted to to make a Durahan, and used Pretty Fly in a combination using the sword and named the Durahan Welcome, after another song from that album. <BR> <BR> <BR>Tip for Pokemon lovers: You can use Pokemon names to in your Monster rancher monsters, just see: <BR> <BR>Dragon       = Charizard <BR>Ducken       = Psyduck <BR>Plant/Monol  = Vileplume <BR>Mew          = Meowth <BR>Phoenix      = Moltres <BR>Blue Phoenix = Articuno <BR>Gaboo        = Muk <BR>Golem        = Golem &#40;duh&#41; <BR>Tiger/Monol  = Houndoom <BR>Zilla        = That whale Pokemon <BR> <BR>And some other more forced names. <BR> <BR>Also, a good Phoenix name would be Fire Chicken. ;_&#41;

 MR2 <BR> <BR>Even better ones, now. My dad named a Dragon from a tusk Salutations, because he combined H and I, from the market. After he raised him, he combined him with Rocky, a pure golem combined from Sylvester&#40;Golem/Henger&#41; and Sandie&#40;Golem/Suezo&#41;, And was named because Sandy and Rocky were roles in popular Sly Stallone movies. He named the resulting child, a Stone Dragon, Condolences, because the errantry notices would make Colt say,&#34;Errantry is discounted this month...Shall we send Condolences?&#34; And when He retired, we combined him with 65%, the Ducklon, named because that was the percentage with a combination of pure Ducken and Pure Beaklon, and got &#39;Mostly Sad&#39;, Because it had 65% Condolences.

 In Mr4 when my brother &#40;Waddafxup101&#41;  combines a monster he names the monster after the main breed and adds JR on the end. For example, he likes to raise the five monsters from the opening cutscene &#40;Dragon, Mocchi, Tiger, Garu, and Golem&#41;. He named his Garu Buddy, his Tiger Striker, his Golem Bonesaw, his Mocchi Pinky, and his Dragon Peepy. So now, after retirement/combining, he has Buddy JR, Stiker JR, and Bonesaw JR. I think that it&#39;s kind of funny, especially in battle. &#40;&#34;And the winner is...Buddy JR!!!&#34;&#41; The wierdest name I had was in MR1 a Naga named Pono, for no real reason. My friend&#39;s Garu in MR4 is named Tienian, because he let me name it.

 One time, I raised a monster named &#34;My a&#42;&#42;&#34;.  That way, Colt would say things like &#34;My a&#42;&#42; is full of energy&#34;, or &#34;My a&#42;&#42; seems a little tired.&#34;  Youu get the gist.  ;&#41;

 Also, sorry for the double post, but much like someone on here &#40;can&#39;t find who...huge thread, you know?&#41; a few months ago, I named my Sueki &#34;Dammit,&#34; so Colt would say, &#34;What&#39;s wrong, Dammit?!&#34;  XD
