 Alright, alright, so almost everyone &#40;including me&#41; likes MR1&#43;2 better.  Still, since all I own is MR3, in an effort to not feel sorry for myself, i am initiating this poll. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll start by mentioning the Encyclopedia.  Very time/effort/sanity-saving, and trading monster entries is cool ^_^

 Octopees, Ogyos, Zans, Momos, Psirollers, and Lesiones are all cool. Not having to unlock a Beaklon is a relief. I like having different places to live in. Baku/Goat &#40;electriceel&#41; looks like a bloated fish. Looking like a bloated fish is a compliment, really, it is! Most of the monster moves are better looking and some are funny.

 oh, and the characteristics, they spice things up a bit. i like having a bunch of rivals that you can interact with, but they get really annoying sometimes. <BR>and i second the encyclopedia, it is the greatest thing

 i REALLY Like the Cell Shaded Graphics. <BR>People say they&#39;re too cute.. which some might be.. but you can still have Mean looking monsters with the Cell Shaded Graphics.  i say Keep the Cell Shades, and just improve on the Monsters!

 MR3 improves the look and quality of the monsters.   <BR>The cell shaded cutesy look may give some people the  <BR>willies but Beaklon, Zan and Dragons especially look  <BR>sinister.  Generally all the monsters look great third time  <BR>around, Jell is a vast improvement over the previous  <BR>&#34;more human&#34; incarnation, cuter and better conceived.   <BR>I wish that all the species from MR1 &amp; MR2 would have  <BR>been included like the Ape &#40;a Lord only&#41;, Worm, Monol  <BR>and Gali &#40;which seems to have become the Joker  <BR>species&#41;.  I would think that MR3 should have had more  <BR>monsters than MR1 &amp; MR2 combined, but perhaps that  <BR>would have been too much data, who knows?  But why  <BR>do some species not have a full compliment of ten  <BR>different styles?  MR1 averaged about fifteen variations  <BR>on a species. <BR> <BR>The Encyclopeida is the best feature as you can now  <BR>borrow CDs &#40;from the library or friends&#41; of rent DVDs  <BR>&#40;when you can afford it&#41; to obtain those rare monsters  <BR>and not have to keep them on ice.  For me Druger was  <BR>the rarest common monster to find after ranching over  <BR>1000 CDs.  I really don&#39;t want to get Train: Drops Of  <BR>Jupiter, but it has a cool variation on Hengar, oh well. <BR>I personally got well into MR1 but had a defective  <BR>memory card and lost it all.  It was a tougher game than  <BR>MR3 which improves on the newer training style of  <BR>MR2.  MR3 has some nice storylines, but it needed  <BR>several more of them as I completed the all the intrigue  <BR>within three days and spent weeks searching my  <BR>collection to fill the encyclopedia. <BR> <BR>I do hope that a fourth installment will fill the gaps that  <BR>MR3 has.

 &#42;All the rivals-It&#39;s nice to have regular human&#40;well, they&#39;re in-game humans but still...&#41; interaction in the game <BR>&#42;The truckloads of storylines <BR>&#42;Your assistant having an actual personality <BR>&#42;Raidens, Shimarungs, Gitans, etc. <BR>&#42;No years shown-cuts down on wondering why nobody&#39;s aged yet. <BR>&#42;The encyclopidia-It ROCKS being able to chekc out a CD from the library, see what it makes, and not having to have that CD to re-make that monster! <BR>&#42;Saucer Stone Pieces-it makes it a bit easier to get some breeds

 Hmmm... I really like the cel-shading, as I like cute monsters, but it doesn&#39;t tone down monsters like fenril. I&#39;m a bit dissapointed in the way they&#39;re making some of the monsters look in mr4 &#40;pixie doesn&#39;t have very pixie looking eyes, baku looks kind of scary now, and pancho... he just doesn&#39;t look right to me. I like the improvement in joker, though.&#41; I like having location-type monsters, although I think mixing 2 monsters together might have been better. &#40;I have a confession... I started out with mr3! I didnt try 1 or 2! &#42;gasp&#42;&#41;

 Personally, I think that that is a bit of a draw-back to the game. &#40;being too easy&#41; I like the cel-shading, though. I&#39;ve always been a fan of cel-shading, no matter what people say. The Gitans and Ogyos are probably THE best part, though.

 MR3 is WAY better. i have 2, 3 and 4 and the third is my fav. The graphics, encyclopedia, and the difficulty is just right. Plus, it has the Heart crystals and Skill items. I love it because it&#39;s so different and it stands out.
