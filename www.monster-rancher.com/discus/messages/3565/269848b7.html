 Whether it&#39;s a &#34;friend&#34; or relative overwriting your Monster Rancher 100&#43; year save, or corrupted memory on the card itself, losing your saves is perhaps one of the most dreaded events in the life of a rancher. In an effort to encourage people to make back-up saves on extra memory cards, I was wondering if people would be willing to share their &#34;lost memory&#34; stories?

 Oh Yes.  The first time I lost an old game, was when my house was struck by lightning, and the entire playstation was fried, destroying both memory cards that were in the console, my MR1 disk, and every other electronic thing in the house &#40;that was plugged in.&#41;  A 200 year game was lost that way. <BR> <BR>My more recent oops was when I over wrote my master game with an experiment in probabilities.  I have been reset back to year 1.  :&#40; <BR> <BR>Lisa is right.  Back up your important games on a card that you do not keep in the playstation. <BR> <BR>-Berge

 In MR1, I lost a save file where I had unlocked everything, and I had to backtrack 40 years to a point in the game where I hadn&#39;t even KNOWN about hidden types &#40;good-bye Ghost...&#41;.  In MR2, when I was splitting my one save file off into five, I accidentally saved over the back-up file AND the primary file of a ranch where I had already raised a legendary Kato, Durahan, and Niton &#40;and was half-way on a Mocchi&#41;.  After that, I made sure that I had TWO back-up files of everything, one of which wouldn&#39;t even be kept in the Playstation except for periodic updates, and did all my monthly-weekly saves on a single &#34;active&#34; file.  It&#39;s already saved me once or twice.

 Ahh, the first and only time I have lost any game data was when I mistakenly used my Mega Memory card as a standard card.  I don&#39;t remember which game I was playing at the time, but suddenly my game froze and I had to reset.  I lost over 12 pages of all the games I had saved.  Most of the data was of games that I had saved just before the end.  Games like FF7, FF8, Breath of Fire III, etc.  Plus several saves on strategy games that I was in process of beating, and also with games I had rented.    <BR> <BR>So, after I went through the emotions of shock, dismay, and anger.  &#40;During the anger state I was sorely tempted to toss my PS through my window&#41;  I finally realized that my mistake was using the Mega Memory card during gameplay.   <BR> <BR>I now only use it for back up, or storage.  When I want to play a game that I have stored on the Mega card, I just transfer the data to a normal card and play the game from there. <BR> <BR>I still haven&#39;t gotten back to the finish on all of my RPG games yet...

 Well, i now have mine backed up. The only time was... when my friend erased my data. i was only a beginer at the time, my only accomplishment was rank 3, and IMa FIMBa tounie. I had 80 monsters and was in year 8! I have recovered from that incident, and the deletion actually benifited me, because i finally stopped spending all my money breeding monsters.  <BR> <BR>And one time i wuz doing a little better, and my PS BUSTED and took the mem card down with it!!! i wuz not too thrilled about that. I never really got around to rebuiling my legend of legia file...

I&#39;m fortunate to have never had a card fry &#40;knock on wood&#41;, but I can&#39;t count the number of games I have saved over during experiments! Most recently on MRBC. I had finished Easy level, and was starting on medium, but saved over my Easy game..arrrrrggghhhh!

 My Original MR was saved onto a &#34;Memory Card Plus&#34; that had the equivelant of 8 Memory cards.  You switched between the pages by pressing a button. <BR> <BR>I thought I just had MR &#34;Backed up on the &#34;Memory Card Plus&#34; but it was not so.  While A friend was trying to show me the ending to Final Fantasy 8 which he had just beaten only a day before me the save wasn&#39;t loading properlly, Finally HIS game loaded from his memory card. <BR> <BR>After  this, he wanted to see where I was in FF8.  So, I popped in my &#34;Memory Card Plus&#34;.. and there was no data... So, I tried to switch between memorycard &#34;pages&#34;.. all the pages were blank.  Later on, I went to do some Slating from MR1 to MR2 &amp; got out what I thought was my &#34;Original saves&#34; &#40;which it was.. I just had everything BUT monster Rancher on it&#41;... I was so sad.  I&#39;ve been using my Wifes MR1 game ever since. =0 &#40;. <BR> <BR>After getting a Dex Drive, I found that my &#34;Memory Card Plus&#34; had not only erased ALL 8 pages, but Also COMBINED THEM INTO ONE!  How sad is that.  what ever I save on 1 page, is on all 8 pages.  So, now I just use my &#34;Memory Card Plus&#34; as a means to go between my PSX and my DexDrive and nothing more.

 My 96 page memory card has deleted my game twice.  Very angry I was.  I save unimportant things there now, things I might want later but don&#39;t mind right now.  I also saved over a game where I had trained a hare/tiger with that was really strong for its time.  I was very upset.  I also saved over the file which I used two worms to get a beaclon.  Needless to say, I try to be careful.

 Well have we all learned a lesson from this? Maybe not yet. I haven&#39;t had my data mysteriously erase and I have the same memory card I got 3 years ago. It is one of the see through blue official Sony memory cards. Here&#39;s the moral of the story. You don&#39;t get something for nothing&#40;or something like that&#41;. I would like to have one card with tons of saves but I have a friend that told me his mega memory card has erased numorous times losing data from multiple Final Fantasies. I say stick with Sony. They haven&#39;t let me down yet. <BR>Anger me you shall not for revenge I will seek.

 oh yes this is one of the most annoying things ever. I lost my whole memory card &#40;360 blocks of data&#41; just like that. i was so angry. i had my final fantasy data on there, monster rancher 1 and 2, Valkyrie Profile. also for the previous post, if you save data on all the cards first &#40;data you dont care about&#41; or in other words format all the cards it wont screw up. i have been using mine now for over a year.

 Oh, yes yes yes. Since my file has gotten erased I have to go all the way through to to get Undine, Beaclon, Joker, etc.  I was near 1200 in my year, and I am now at 1030, but at 8th rank.  I can make a comeback, but I wish my file didn&#39;t get erased, it had my R2-D2&#40;Henger Doll&#41; that was supposed to be combined with Draco Doll I was raising.  Good combination too......urghhhh

 My starting game was erased by my brother. I had the first slot, he had the second. An over-active finger jamming on the X button to save the game destroyed my game. I was about 70 years into it. And yet I was better off with it deleted, I&#39;m working on a much more successful game now.

Now I just need another 6 cases like klonoa 2 for my Ps1 memory cards. My Ps2 memory card has over 3 megs of Ps1 saves. none are copies of other games.

I had a really bad loss one time. Me and my friends were playing GT2 and during the save and load process my friend kept pulling my memory in and out of the socket. It still worked for a little while after that, but the next day it all went <FONT COLOR="119911">GONE</FONT>. I was so mad cause I had almost all my games that I regularly play on this card and that was including MR2. I had a Pheonix at about 4600 total and a raised up Wracky. It might not seem that much of a loss, but it was a pain getting those paradoxines to raise my Wracky. And just to raise my wracky was a pain do to nature. But now I got two files all backed up on two memory cards, JUST IN CASE.

 UGH! I just lost my MR1 save game yesterday. My girlfriend&#39;s six year old son saved his game over mine &#40;my fault for leaving it in the slot&#41;. I was raising a monster for the upcoming MR1 tournament. <BR> <BR>My girlfriend has no idea how I could get so upset &#34;over a game.&#34; In reality, she&#39;s right. There&#39;s no reason to get super upset, but the thing that I&#39;m going to mention no one else has on this thread, but I know everyone experienced it: That eternity of a second where you&#39;re reading your file&#39;s gone before your brain actually understands what happened and that sinking feeling in your stomach. <BR> <BR>A side note to this: I really enjoy watching him play monster rancher, although he has no idea what he&#39;s doing. His favorite part is making monsters from CDs and then immediately freezing them and combining them.

 I lost all of my files about two weeks ago.  I had a back-up memory card, but I had to give it to someone to get my mega memory card back &#40;long story&#41;.  So I&#39;m happy to see all of my files again &#40;It had been about a year&#41; when all of the sudden blip! All of my files, including the ones with my maxxed Garuda on were gone.  I immidiatly bought a new back-up card, but I still had to start over.  I was in a daze for like 2 hours.

Super Memory Card 8000, 8x the size of a normal memory card, and only $20! Great deal at the time, it even came with a one year warranty! <BR> <BR>Alas, this tale has not a happy ending however, and 1 year 1 month later my card wouldn&#39;t change pages, and then completely deleted itself. It started working again somehow, and not knowing any better, i continued using it, playing MR2. Well, it gliched up again, won&#39;t change pages, stuck on page 8, 7 pages away from my Monster Rancher 2, PE2 and varoius other saves. Well, I am buying a new card tomorrow &#40; a Playstation brand one&#41; so all my problems are hopefully over. <BR> <BR><U>The moral of the story is</U>: &#42;NEVER&#42; but a Super Memory Card 8000, or any other offbrand cards, the are dangerous to a gamers physical and metal health.

 Third-party cards can be ok, I have an old Interact card that has served me very well over the years.  The main moral is that mega/super/ultra fantastic memory cards aren&#39;t very reliable.  I have lost the data on my mega SEVERAL times.  However, if you do have a mega, the main thing you should do to prevent this from happening is to NEVER remove the memory card when it is in a machine that is still powering up.  This has been the main cause of my erasures, and most likely several others.

 Yeah,i&#39;ve done it before.Infact it was Diablo&#39;s fault...We were playing one night and I decided to go to sleep and Diablo continued to play MR2 well I had my memory card in slot one and my master save was on slot one.So it was late at night and I guess he saved over mine on accident,because his was one slot 2...Was I mad?Not really.It&#39;s just a game an I wasn&#39;t anywhere good in my master save at the time.Then the dex drive saved me because when I was raising Sonansu for A Class I accidentally saved over it with another file.So I got my dex out and started at the market save point of time.Whew.^_^

 My Madcatz 12 pages memory card destroyed a good number of important saves, not as much as my nephew, Bruno. <BR>He needed a memory card to save his new gran turismo games while i was not home, and took what he thought was a memory card full of old saves where it was written &#34;finished&#34;.  <BR>He thought &#34;finished&#34; games meant saves I wouldn`t need anymore. Of course he erased all of my greatest save games, anything that would give bragging rights about anygame. <BR>When acknoledging the loss I tried to get angry, but really couldn`t. Maybe i`m getting old.

 Okay, my turn: <BR> <BR>Lesson to be learned: every now and then on MR2 you&#39;ll try to save and the date info won&#39;t come up? DON&#39;T SAVE! Easy way to fry a file. The save will go through, but you won&#39;t be able to load it again. And that was the save I had the God Slate on! AARGH! <BR> <BR>Now, as to non-standard devices that really worked well, let us say a prayer for the poor departed V-Mem &#40;or as I used to call it, &#34;The Poor Man&#39;s PSX hard drive&#34;&#41;. Never lost a game with the thing, and it was the main of my 3 redundant data drops &#40;no, I&#39;m not paranoid... much&#41;. What happened there was it was in the back of the playsation that was stolen. My only consolation was that 90% of the saves on that thing were for import games, siince it was a Japanese PSX. Imagine the face on the thief the first time he tried playing a US Game!

 Lets see here.... I have a habit of when I get a new game &#40;well one that into fast, usually RPGs&#41; I tend to play for days unending &#40;unless I pass out with controller in hand&#41;. Can&#39;t do that much any more but its important knowledge, for this &#39;story&#39; that I used to do that up until my daughter was born. <BR> <BR>Final Fantasy X just realease &#40;I&#39;m a die hard FF player&#41; so as usual &#40;for me&#41; I start playing for days at a time. I guess about a weeks worth on play time &#40;give or take&#41; I&#39;m very near the end &#40;at Zanarkand &#42;sp?&#42;&#41;. I fell asleep in the middle of playing in the wee hours of the morning. I wake up later that day, controller still in hand FFX still on. So I pick back up where I left off and head over to a save point. And it tells me theres nothing in the memory card slot. So I roll off the couch and go to check my memory card. And its not there. I tore the entertainment center apart, no where. &#40;There&#39;s only 2 people in the house actually use the game systems, me and my younger brother. My father doesn&#39;t like games, my mom is a nintendo/computer person and my older brother had moved out, however he just happened to be at the house that night&#41; Afterwards I found my younger brother and asked him if he had it, he didn&#39;t &#40;I know he would just take it to be a &#42;beep&#42; cuz he had saves on it to. So I went to my older brother and he says &#34;You probably took it out and left it somewhere&#34;. Needless to say I have no doubt he took it, he had just gotten a PS2 hiself&#40;might have been his roommate actually...&#41; To this day it&#39;s not resurfaced, and I lost every bit of game data I had, except my FFX cuz It had stayed on all night and I managed to save it on another card. <BR> <BR>Me and my younger brother are still trying to figure out the logic behind our brother&#39;s reasoning that I took it out mid game while sleeping....

 Well, I can top that one, Fox. <BR> <BR>The other night, I was playing MR3 and started to doze off so I decided to save my game.  Well, I had gotten into the habit of removing my memory cards before turning the system off so that they don&#39;t get damaged from stray electric current.  Well, apparently, I had done just that before one of my heavier dozing periods and I didn&#39;t realize I had.  So, I go to tell it that I want to save the game and it tells me I have no memory cards.  I started freaking out and realized that the cards were both neatly stacked on top of the system, yet I don&#39;t remember doing it and I know that at least the PS2 one was in before I started playing since I was playing on a saved game.  =&#41; <BR> <BR>Trousle

 I had nearly beaten the game in mr3, and decided to make a new game, just for fun. I was so used to the procedure of: Save. Slot 1. Number 3. Yes I want to overwrite. And my game was gone, it took me a while to realize it, actually... &#40;This happened about 40 times again after:P&#41;

 Ah yes.  I play D&amp;D on the weekends, and had a player who brought his two young boys over.  They wanted to play on the PS to pass the time, and I told them it was ok.  They decided to try MR2 and everything was fine... <BR> <BR>...then they saved over my game... <BR> <BR>...the game I&#39;d been playing for the past 2 YEARS... <BR> <BR>AAAAAUUUUUUGH!!! &#40;Charlie Brown moment&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;d felt like someone had punched me in the gut.  All that work, all that research, all those wonderful championship monsters...all gone. <BR> <BR>Now I always keep a back-up save on my second memory card. &#40;Oh, and I act like a grouchy old man when kids ask to play on my system and tell them to get a job and buy their own.&#41; =&#41;

 i did NOT lose the data of my FF8, but, i MUST delete it. why? i uses gameshark code &#34;save anyhwere&#34; and the game freeze in disc 2. &#34;save anywhere&#34; code is the most dangerous code!!!!! don&#39;t ever uses it in any RPG game! that&#39;s my suggestion....

 I have had two data losses: <BR> <BR>1.  I started a new game in Digimon World 3.  I was going to start a new game, play until I got stuck, and then use Action Replay cheat codes to fix my problem &#40;By the way, I don&#39;t like them much, because it&#39;s boring to be overpowerful in DW3&#41;.  Well, I saved it, and accidently overwrote my GREAT file.  Without cheats, I had almost completed the game, and I had unlocked two Champion, Ultimate, and Mega forms for each Digimon.  I have better files with cheat codes now, but I&#39;m going to start a new, NORMAL file and get back where I was before, so I can play with a challenge again. <BR> <BR>2. I had recently gotten the game RPG Maker 2.  I didn&#39;t like it much, because it was almost impossible to understand most of it.  But I wanted to make games anyway, so I started clearing space on my MC, because this game takes tons of memory card space.  Guess what I accidently deleted the save file for.  My macho MR3 file.  I had almost everything in the game.  I didn&#39;t mind then, but now I seem snappier and not as happy.  Not because I miss what I had. I&#39;ve started a new file and I&#39;m starting to catch up.  Heck, I might eventually end up with the same monsters.  I&#39;m feeling sad and angry because I lost a save that I had put so much time into, time that I could&#39;ve used doing something that would not cause me to lose my hardest work ever for the sake of a game that I didn&#39;t even like. <BR>I took RPG Maker 2 back and got a 20 dollar store credit.  I used it to buy NBA Live 2003, which is a great basketball game. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t mind the loss of my DM3 file, since I&#39;m back to where I was now.  But I learned from my MR3 experience that changed me a bit.  Never again will I sacrifice anything for the sake of save files for a game I don&#39;y like.   <BR> <BR>Never.

 What happened to Berge happened to my computer once, man that really sucked. It fried the power supply, dvd/cd drives&#40;computer couldnt use any after that&#41; , and just became a really bad computer. It broke 2 months ago, now i have to use some freakishly bad Aptiva IBM. You can ask Sonikku, im not exadgerrating. Also, once my brother took out the memory card during a save, and on another instance a Sony brand psx memory card just stopped working, and we&#39;re still not shure exactly why. It could be &#39;cause Sonikku tried to make a hopper/pheonix with a gamehark, or it was fried somehow.

 Well, I&#39;ve had my fair share of data losses as  <BR>well, both being pokemon games. <BR> <BR>Number 1: <BR>I was at karate and like everyone else at the  <BR>time, I brang along my GBA SP loaded with my  <BR>Pokemon Leafgreen cartridge. I played it and on  <BR>the car ride home, I noticed that my GBA was  <BR>empty. My brother had asked me before that during  <BR>the class my GBA should be kept in his bag. But  <BR>it appeared that when it came back it had no  <BR>cartridges. &#42;Sigh&#42; and that&#39;s how my unbeatable  <BR>lvl 100 trio went away. Goodbye Catorple  <BR>Blastoise&#41;, goodbye, Mewtwo and finally, goodbye  <BR>Pidgeot.   <BR> <BR>Ok, Number 2: <BR>Alright, this was when I was in grade 5 or 4. Me  <BR>and my friend decided to temporarily trade games.  <BR>I gave my friend Pokemon Ruby while he gave me  <BR>Ice Age. I completed the game in 2 days, and I  <BR>was gonna ask my friend if he could give it back.  <BR>He said a week, I agreed. Then, soon before he  <BR>would give it back, after school he and another  <BR>of his friends told me that his little brother  <BR>had started a new game. I was ANGRY!!! I asked  <BR>him why and this was his excuse &#39;Oh, my brother  <BR>told me to save over it!&#39;. I&#39;ve always trusted  <BR>that friend, and never really liked his brother.  <BR>Oh well, Good bye all but one memories from  <BR>Leafgreen. Now my only memory is a lvl 62  <BR>Dugtrio, which isn&#39;t that good.    <BR> <BR>I still sometimes look for that cartridge and  <BR>I&#39;ve alway pestered my friend&#39;s brother why, Why,  <BR>WHY! he saved over that game. <BR> <BR>Well, my two cents.

 I&#39;ve had a couple similar instances with my original Pokemon Blue cartridge.  Once my brother put it in the microwave for a few seconds as a goof.  Lost my lovely level 100 Articuno and level 100 Jynx.  And the other time it went through the wash in my jeans.  Yeah, wasn&#39;t as much memorable on there, but it pretty much fried my cartridge for good :&#40;
