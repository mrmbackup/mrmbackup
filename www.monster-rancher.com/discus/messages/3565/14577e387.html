 So, I was playing through EVO, and it felt like it had a few good ideas. Since I haven&#39;t played the DS or Online version, I&#39;m not sure if they changed the formula some. So, my suggestions. <BR> <BR>1. Return some of the older monsters. Namely Gali, and keep some of the newer ones. In this case, namely Piroro. Not that great a suggestion, so, next one. <BR> <BR>2. Make the moves be somewhat based on the combination. Let&#39;s say you make a Piroro/Tiger. It would have the majority of moves be Piroro, but some would be Tiger. Maybe a select amount of skills for each species are only allowed when the species in question is the subspecies. This would give pure breeds a slight advantage. EVO sort of did this with the traits, but I&#39;d like to see it with the actual moves. Hope this made sense. <BR> <BR>3. Keep the adventure part, but upgrade the breeding. EVO did really well with the adventure part, much better than I&#39;d expect. But, they need to focus on the monster raising aspect more. Bring back some of the aspects of MR2, which was a really good game. <BR> <BR>Comments?

 3. The adventure mode was fantastic, but Tecmo overdid it. I have raised many monsters, but have been stuck on Grabad Factory since 2005. Tecmo should make an MR game not like MR2, but more like MR4, which had great, challenging adventures AND breeding, although Tecmo could &#34;merge&#34; MR4/EVO&#39;s adventures with MR2&#39;s breeding system. <BR> <BR>2. That is actually a great idea.   It wouuld also allow Piroro a lot more stremgths. For example, imagine it with Blizzard. What about specials, though? <BR> <BR>1. I liked Gali but i would prefer Magic &#40;a Gali/Monol in human form from MR1&#41;, Falco, Xenon, Metalner, and Ghost. Imagine being able to carry on a lifetime because a monster became Ghost when it died. &#40;my idea&#41;

 3. I haven&#39;t played any of the games except for 2 and EVO, so I can&#39;t say. I would like 4, if just because it has another monster breed I like, Suzzurin. <BR> <BR>2. I think the earlier ones had something like this. As for specials, something could be worked out. Perhaps a few bizarre moves for special. Not sure. And this would help all the different breeds if done right, not just Piroro. <BR> <BR>3. I do remember those monsters. Well, not Falco and Xenon, but still. It&#39;s just that Gali is one of my favorites, simply because it&#39;s so different.

 those were from MFDS &#40;falco, xenon&#41; <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t belive gali  is that different from Pheonix or Pixie, they all use fire, and are mainly INT breeds. But yeah, Gali was great, I like him too.

 I know. I just have yet to play it. I like the idea of Abisu, but I have no idea what the species really look like. <BR> <BR>And I meant more appearance-wise. Joker, but that&#39;s about it. It also feels like he should be there, as a sort of opposite to Joker.

 Yes, I know. That is what I heard, at least. I&#39;d just like to actually see him, instead of trying to guess by it&#39;s description.
