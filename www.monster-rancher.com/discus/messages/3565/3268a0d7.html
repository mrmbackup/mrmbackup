I believe his purpose was to protect the Jewish people. After that, somewhere, the term golem came to represent any man-made creature that was made to look like a man. In Dungeons and Dragons &#40;the roleplaying game&#41; they had clay golems, flesh golems &#40;Frankenstein&#39;s Monster, anyone?&#41;, iron golems &#40;robots?&#41; and other items including rock, but the ORIGINAL golem was clay. FYI.  <BR>-- Gatchaman &#40;<A HREF="mailto:TheCaj@aol.com">TheCaj@aol.com</A>&#41;, February 15, 2000.  <BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------ <BR> <BR>Yes, Gatchaman, I had heard that tale of golems before. While Gollum is in the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, his real name was Smeagol, he got the gollum from a sound he made. I don&#39;t think it has any connection to the golem in the game. Also I read a book where undines were the magic servants of magicians with the water affiliation&#40;as in earth, air, fire, and water&#41;. Each element had their own servants, water-undine, fire-salamander, air-sylph, and I don&#39;t remember earth. it was an interesting book, I think it was called Lord of Fire but I am not sure.  <BR>-- Miss Carrie &#40;<A HREF="mailto:musicality1@earthlink.net">musicality1@earthlink.net</A>&#41;, February 16, 2000.  <BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------ <BR> <BR>beside the real easy names, Hare, Ape, Dragon, Worm, Ghost, Plant. i have a few others Bajarl is a Djinn or Geine.

 Wow! Thanks Jello! I was wondering if everyone who helped with this thread and the one we recently recreated would post and tell me how they would feel about me taking all this data and making one big chart out of it. -With credit given to everyone, of course. Just thought it might be useful in the future to have it all in a little more readable format!

 Sorry for being so scatter brained, but just one more.  Baku is the name of a breed of Japanese demon beasts that eat peoples dreams.  Thay are normally portrayed as looking like a tapir &#40;?&#41;&#40;the long nosed pig like thing&#41;.  I have also seen it portrayed as a small pig, but that was in a Rumiko Takahashi film &#34;Beautiful Dreamer&#34;.  &#40;I know, RNA covered this one also, but this is actual new information.&#41; <BR> <BR>-Berge

 Some added insight to the names of the rares - as provided by the Monster Farm 2 Saikyo CD Databook 1000! II: <BR> <BR>#23 - Poison &#40;pixie/????&#41;: The base CD used was Takashi Sorimachi&#39;s cd single&#34;POISON~iitai koto mo ienai kono yo no naka wa&#34;, thus the name. Oddly enough, it&#39;s X&#39;s cd album &#34;Vanishing vision&#34; that gives you the Heel Raid attack from the start. <BR> <BR>#25 - Mia &#40;pixie/????&#41;: Another base cd, this one Ami Susuki&#39;s cd single &#34;Nothing without you&#34; &#40;Mia is Ami in reverse Japanese - get it? ;-&#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>#50 - Paddock &#40;centaur/????&#41;: Name changed to &#34;Trotter&#34; in the US version <BR> <BR>#56 - Iiden &#40;colorpandora/????&#41;: Unlocked by Taito&#39;s smash hit game &#34;Densha de Go!&#34;, thus &#34;iiden&#34; &#40;good train&#41;. Changed to Tram for US version <BR> <BR>#86 - Dennen &#40;Wracky/????&#41;: Leaving the whole &#34;Chucky/Wracky&#34; thing aside for a second - <BR> <BR>Yes, that&#39;s right - there is no &#34;Satan Clause&#34; in the Japanese version. You have instead a cariacture of a famous Osaka... well, character &#40;;-&#41;&#41; <BR> <BR>#111 - New Bottle &#40;Golem/????&#41; Next in the &#34;this&#39;ll never fly here in US&#34; sweepstakes we have a drinking man&#39;s golem - or at least a golem who drinks. Unlocking CD: the Playstation game &#34;Cocktail Harmony&#34; &#40;no, I&#39;m NOT kidding&#41; <BR> <BR>#143 - Shogun &#40;Durahan/????&#41; Fans of J-pop have probably heard of Kome Kome Club &#40;I call them Japan&#39;s answer to Funkadelic ;-&#41;&#41;. Is it any wonder, then, that their sendup of Japanese tourism, Funk Fujiyama should be Shogun&#39;s base CD? <BR> <BR>#145 - Kokushi Musou &#40;Durahan/????&#41; Base CD: Simple 1500 series Vol.1: THE Mahjohng. In Mahjohng, Kokushi Musou is &#42;the&#42; winning combination - thus &#34;ultimate fighter&#34;. <BR> <BR>#179 - Keroppa &#40;Hopper/????&#41; &#34;kero&#34; is the sound made when a frog croaks; thus, Sanrio&#39;s cute &#34;Kerokeroppi&#34; and our hopper, changed to Frog Hopper in the US &#40;you gotta figure Hasbro would&#39;ve  wanted a cut for Frogger ;-&#41;. base CD: Pocket Biscut&#39;s &#34;Green Man&#34; &#40;oy!&#41; <BR> <BR>#192 - Tornado &#40;Hare/????&#41; The latest in our change for the US market monsters, his base CD is the PSX game &#34;Fighting Illusion - K-1 Grand Prix&#34;. Would someone with this game reading this PLEASE see if it produces a Kung fu Hare in the US version? <BR> <BR>These ten are all I have time for now, but there are plenty others...
