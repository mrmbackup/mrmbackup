 &#34;I am the Queen. Come - be the Queen&#39;s pawn...&#34; <BR> <BR>That line, from the &#34;Checkmate&#34; episode of The Prisoner, got me thinking along some seriously warped lines for a breeding/raising project. Follow me on this - it may take a while... <BR> <BR>Originally, what sparked was an idea for an MR-related fanfic. Figure that major tournament days are like carnival days in the cities/towns where they&#39;re held. Now, it&#39;s been well established that a Nobility class exists in the world of Monster Rancher from descriptions on monster cards. And, one of the more popular events at Renaissance Faires and the like are the &#34;Living Chess&#34; matches. So, wouldn&#39;t it make sense that the nobility, with their &#34;well-trained beasts&#34; would do the same thing, but with their monsters instead of themselves? <BR> <BR>Fast forward three days. Outline for story is written, only thing that hasn&#39;t been done is to decide which monsters get selected, which led to another thought... what &#42;would&#42; a Durahan-themed chess set look like? What would be the ultimate good/bad natured set? Could you even &#42;do&#42; a Beaclon set, for example? <BR> <BR>So, here are the challenges, board and game-wise: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Come up with a monster-themed chess set. The original guidelines I set for myself were &#40;1&#41; the King had to be a pure breed of it&#39;s theme, and the Queen had to have the theme as it&#39;s main &#40;ex. Durahan and Leznia &#40;sp&#41;&#41;, &#40;2&#41; there has to be a plausible reason for selecting a monster to match a type &#40;Durahans and Centaurs being natural &#39;knights&#39;, Galis in their roles as protective spirits equal Bishops, etc.; and &#40;3&#41; if at all possible, Mocchis are pawns. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Raise your own chess set to battle against friends. To be fair, the weighting would have to be as follows, based on the tried and true &#34;X-piece is worth so many pawns&#34; chess rating: <BR> <BR>King, Queen - S-class <BR>Castle - A class <BR>Knight - B class <BR>Bishop - B class <BR>Pawn - C-class <BR> <BR>And, so that you don&#39;t get people sharking maxxed-out C&#39;s, the class weighting from the Time Capsule Creative Lessons 9-11 thread could be used for stats. Play would follow as per a normal chess game, but when a piece takes a piece, you switch to MR battle mode. Attacking player takes 1P, defending player takes 2P. You either then fight it out, or have the computer do it. The piece that wins stays on the board. <BR> <BR>I welcome suggestions and criticisms to the above rules. And to start things off, here&#39;s the Durahan-based chess set I&#39;m currently working on: <BR> <BR>King: Templar &#40;Durahan/Durahan&#41; <BR>Queen: Valkyrie &#40;Durahan/Pixie&#41; <BR>Bishop: D&#39;Arc &#40;Pixie/Durahan&#41; <BR>Knight: Chessman &#40;Centaur/Durahan&#41; <BR>Castle: Dartmoor &#40;Golem/Durahan&#41; <BR>Pawn: Squire &#40;Mocchi/Durahan&#41; ^_^;

 Well how about these for the actual white pieces for a set if they made the game in the style of &#34;Battle Chess&#34; any one play that game? <BR> <BR>King - Zilla King &#40;Zilla/???&#41; <BR>Queen - ?????...Some kind of pixie I guess. <BR>Bishop - Gali &#40;Gali/Gali&#41; <BR>Knight - Centaur &#40;Centaur/Centuar&#41; unless a more horse like one. <BR>Castle - Golem &#40;Golem/Golem&#41; <BR>Pawn - KnightMocchi &#40;Mocchi/Durahan&#41; <BR> <BR>I do not mean to rip off what scopedog put down but those where the best for what I can think of for those pieces. <BR>I do not have all of them but most I can make or get.

 I for one think that Scopedog has a FANTASTIC idea!  It&#39;s very similar sounding to &#34;The Unholy War&#34; by Eidos, but with more of an MR theme to it.  Being one that intends to join the business of game developers, I truly think that Scopedog is on to something. WTG, Scope!  mind if I steal...err..I mean, USE that idea one day ^.^ ;P

 I think it would be a fun game in itself, but it wouldn&#39;t be anything like chess.  If pawns have C class limits from that thread and Queens have S class limits, a pawn would never be able to kill a queen, but that is the beauty of chess.  I think it would be fun and interesting because you get to battle different monster&#39;s with your friends, but it wouldn&#39;t be at all like chess.  Maybe if a pawn gets into position to attack a queen, it is given some kind of advantage, like a 2 hit headstart before the other player can attack, otherwise there would be no strategy.

 You&#39;ve got a point, Master. I&#39;m just worried about the &#34;one-hit kill&#34; syndrome we&#39;re all familiar with. Still, theoretically, any piece should be able to take any other piece; I just wanted to add an atmosphere of uncertainty to it. <BR> <BR>How&#39;s this: all pieces must be A-class or better, with the King and Queen being at least M4-class S rank?  <BR> <BR>And, adding on to the fantasy sets... <BR> <BR>Lords of the Deep Chess set <BR>King: Zilla &#40;Zilla/Zilla&#41; <BR>Queen: Undine &#40;Undine/Undine&#41; <BR>Bishop: Siren &#40;Undine/Joker&#41; <BR>Knight: &#40;name&#41;&#40;Centaur/Arrowhead&#41; <BR>Rook: &#40;name&#41; &#40;Golem/Jell&#41; <BR>Pawn: Niton &#40;Niton/Niton&#41;

Oh and the breakdown should be like this... <BR>King S-level Legends <BR>Queen S-level M4 <BR>Bishop, Rook, Knight S-level <BR>Pawn A-level <BR> <BR>After every battle the monster should recieve stat gains, if the monster is the attacking monster it should start with 99 guts and the defending with 0.

 For those of you that have played the old &#34;Battlechess&#34; games, you should remember that the opposing forces were of the flags: Gryphon &#40;or jumping Lion, your call since the image wasn&#39;t disticntive&#41; and Dragon.  I thought that was an interesting idea, since both WERE royal symbols. Hence, I&#39;ve decided to keep with the tradition and create an original set for each of these. <BR> <BR> <BR>Dragons <BR> <BR>King: Ragnarok &#40;Dragon/Monol&#41; <BR>Queen: Daina &#40;Pixie/Dragon&#41; <BR>Bishop: Ebony &#40;Mock/Joker&#41; <BR>Knight: Garnet &#40;Henger/Dragon&#41; <BR>Rook: Dagon &#40;Golem/Arrowhead&#41; <BR>Pawns: Ash &#40;Plant/Monol&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Gryphons <BR> <BR>King: Phoenix <BR>Queen: Undine <BR>Bishop: Prince Hare &#40;Hare/Gali&#41; <BR>Knight: Garuda &#40;Durahan/Phoenix&#41; <BR>Rook: Battle Rocks &#40;Golem/Durahan&#41; <BR>Pawns: Skipper &#40;Hopper/Tiger&#41;

 hmm... how about a zuum team? Here we go... <BR> <BR>King: Noblesaurian &#40;gali/zuum&#41; <BR>Queen: Fairysaurian &#40;pixie/zuum&#41; <BR>Bishop: Houndsaurian &#40;tiger/zuum&#41; <BR>knight: Shellsaurain &#40;worm/zuum&#41; <BR>rook: Salamander &#40;dragon/zuum&#41; <BR>pawns: Zuum <BR> <BR>The reason i chose zuum to be the pawn instead of the king is because the zuum is somewhat plain looking, and noblesaurian looks more like it would be a king. fairysaurain looks female, so it would be queen. Shellsaurian wears &#34;armor&#34; so it should be the knight. the bishop is like a king&#39;s aid, so the houndsaurian is the loyal servant of the king. so? whadya think?
