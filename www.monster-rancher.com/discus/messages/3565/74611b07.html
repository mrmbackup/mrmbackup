 I saw a few names that caught my attention and was wondering where all of you got the names you use here&#40;Lisa is an obvious one&#41;. Two specific ones are Alucard blue&#40;I&#39;m guessing Symphony of the Night, awsome game&#41;and Lacan&#40;guessing Xenogears, another awsome game&#41;.

 Eagle is my old high-school nickname, because I always had the fighting spirit and need for freedom.  The Eagle and the Fox are my spirit animals.  I used to use the analogy that we are all special animals, and was teased by the bullies about being shot down. <BR> <BR>Fierce is actually my last name.  Grimm translated to Enlish = Fierce.  Fierce was a title once given to the equivalent of a &#34;knight&#34; back in the days of the nomadic tribes.

 Kurasu Soratobu is Japanese.  <BR> <BR>Kurasu=Class <BR>Soratobu=To Fly In The Sky <BR> <BR>Which makes me: class flying in the sky? <BR> <BR>Ok, the reason behind this is a misspelling and mistranslation: I wrote a character for a fanfic that I wanted to name &#39;Raven&#39;. Raven &#40;or crow&#41; in Japanese is &#39;Karasu&#39;. Due to a friend&#39;s mistranslation, it was rendered &#39;Kurasu&#39;. And by the time I got corrected, I was known more as &#39;Kurasu&#39; than my real name. So it stuck. :&#41;

 Tigerbubble is my little way of saying Galum, which is the water-going sub-breed of Tiger. A Galum is a Tiger that lives in the ocean, and all monsters in the ocean make bubbles.  <BR>The reason i initially chose a Tiger &#40;rather than just saying galum or galumbubble&#41; was because it reminds me of my late dog &#40;Benson&#41;, and is nearly the namesake of my still living cat &#40;Tigger&#41;. So it only seemed right to stick with a Tiger. <BR> <BR>PS: i&#39;m not really sure why Tigers remind me of my late dog, since he was a Bichon Frise, maybe it&#39;s just the canine thing.

 I chose my handle &#34;Corpse&#34; for three reasons. One, it&#39;s the street name I&#39;d be known by, if I still hung with some certain friends of mine. Two, it&#39;s been my rancher name since MR1. Three, the idea came to me when I bought a copy of Resident Evil 2 &#40;brand new at the time&#41; for only $6.66 off a friends little brother. &#40;Don&#39;t ask how I got the idea to start using my online name Corpse outta this; even I haven&#39;t figured that out yet&#41;

 I&#39;ve gone by too many names, none of which had any real inspiration.  <BR> <BR>Originally I went by paj363, which is still my Hotmail address. Then wehn I joined Uo, I needed a good name for a fighter, so I named myself Jack Varukisas. When I made the name, I didn&#39;t realize it ended in &#39;kisas&#39;, which, sadly, sounds like something that a bad student might do in order to raise their grades. After my friend pointed that out, I panicked and wanted a new name. After looking through some of my MtG &#40;Magic the Gathering&#41; cards, I saw a card that I liked alot - Aether Flash. I liked Aether, so I dubbed myself Aetheri. After a while at Gamefaqs, I got tired of that name and wanted yet another new one. So I made Khift. I&#39;ve stuck with it for almost half a year now, so it should stay permanently.

 lovesaurian was something i made up on the spur of the moment when i was asking about the hot springs on the old message board. i wanted it to be something-saurian, as my fav. monsters at the time were the zuums. my friend &#40;sitting next to me&#41; suggested love, and thus, lovesaurian. i don&#39;t like it that much, but i don&#39;t like change, so looks like i&#39;m stuck for it. :&#41; i&#39;m known in most other places as either Lisa &#40;my real name&#41; Greywords or Lisa Ri. why? if you watch slayers of fushigi yuugi you should be able to figure it out.

 And you never will. <BR> <BR>As for Jokers_Avenger, he made that name because I continually beat him down so he started training a lot of jokers to &#34;avenge&#34; his other monsters.  Too bad only one joker ever beat any of my monsters...

 LOL.. Torey&#39;s Logic.. <BR> <BR>Mosnter Fenrick: <BR> <BR>Originally Fenrick was my First RPG &#40;D&amp;D&#41; Character name.  he was the Dashing Elf &#40;Fighter / Mage&#41;.  I played him as an over charismatic Han-solo. <BR> <BR>Most of my &#34;Serious, hardcore&#34; D&amp;D friends thought this was outrageously funny.. and so started actually calling me &#34;Fenrick&#34;.  it became a nickname, and so when I got my first computer with e-mail addresses they became Fenrick so my friends could remember. <BR> <BR>Monster came into play as I started getting online with the Mosnter Rancher stuff... and so was evolved into the Main/Sub of Monster Fenrick. <BR> <BR>&#40;of course i am still named Frendric, frankie, fendrik amongst many many other misspellings.. i didn&#39;t realize it was that hard to spell&#41;

 Djinnmastr is a combination of Djinn, which is from Magic: The Gathering, and Master, which is a person who is in charge of something. Back in the day, when i played MTG, Djinn&#39;s were insanely powerful cards that had a tendancy to damage their owners. Another card similar to Djinn was Efreet, and, although i&#39;m not sure, i think Djinns are Genies and Efreets are Ifrits &#40;Like in Final Fantasy, i dunno the mythological meaning&#41; So why do i still use this name even though i don&#39;t play M:TG, and why do i use it without an &#34;E&#34; in Mastr? Because I signed up for AOL many years ago, back when there was a 10 character limit on the names, and I never wanted to change it, since this is what people knew me as. Its that simple

 My nickname comes like this. Although know one calls me &#34;phatlad&#34; &#40;everyone calls me bigdaddy&#41;, here&#39;s how I got fatlad. <BR>My friends and I were playing a golf game on sega, and you could only have six characters maximum to enter your name. <BR>I have what you would call a weight problem, and I tend to poke fun of myself a lot &#40;all in good humor, I&#39;m a funny guy&#41;. So, I chose the largest golfer of the bunch and put the name &#34;fatlad&#34; as his name. <BR>Anywho, about a year later, the &#34;ph&#34; craze swept the nation &#40;around the time of the atlanta olympics, I believe&#41;. I was getting into online stuff and set up a yahoo! email account, and fatlad already was taken so I chose &#34;phatlad&#34; to be funny. &#40;my friends and I always prounced the ph on purpose to be funny, like the p-hat farm, instead of the fat farm. I know, we&#39;re so crazy!&#41; <BR>Since then, I&#39;ve just kept it for every thing I&#39;ve joined online. either that or the alternate &#34;phatladok&#34; for oklahoma.

He&#39;s managed to become one of the government&#39;s &#34;top men&#34; simply by being reliable and personable, and capable of stopping artillery shells with his chest and lifting a tank. He&#39;s an all-round good guy and a lot of fun to roleplay.

 My first nickname was from a character I made for &#39;Vampire-Dark Ages&#39;  Ly&#39;fandes.  &#40;say the name slow, you&#39;ll get the joke&#41; <BR> <BR>Next, a few years later, I was still into the whole vampire game thing, and made this name.  Daeore Dermegil.  I had a book of &#39;English to Elvish; &#40;by J.R.R. Tolkein&#41;  <BR>Dae = Shadow <BR>Ore = Heart <BR>Der = Dark <BR>Megil = Sword <BR> <BR>The end result was Daeore Dermegil.  &#40;said: Day&#39;or&#39;eh Der&#39;me&#39;guile &#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always been a sword freak.  I have a nice little collection already too.  So, I really liked this name.  Sounded good on and off paper. <BR> <BR>I even wrote fanfiction &#40;sailor moon, I know I know no stones please&#41; with him in it.  And have used the name ever since.

 My full online name is Trousle Undrhil.  I picked Trousle because it&#39;s a mispelling of Trouble.  Don&#39;t ask why I was going to use Trouble Undrhil for a name ... cause I wasn&#39;t.  =&#41;  Trousle just sounded cool.  And, no ... I didn&#39;t get Undrhil from The Lord of the Rings.  I never even read the trilogy until someone asked me if that was where I got my name.  I actually got the name Undrhil from the name of the street I used to live on in Orlando, FL &#40;Lake Underhill Rd.&#41;  I originally was using Underhill, but when I tried to get the name on AOL once, it was being used, so I shortened it to Undrhil and I haven&#39;t changed it back.  =&#41; <BR> <BR>Trousle

 Fun fun fun. <BR> <BR>Well, tracing real far back I was once known as Weirdo1983.  I was weird and my birthyear is 1983.  I then got interesting in nwn &#40;the old aol freeware version&#41; and changed to DL Ambush &#40;a combination of my DragonLord guild and Ambush, my soccer team&#41;.  Now it starts getting relevant.  A friend got me into gundam wing.  By far my favorite gundam was Deathscythe.  It had a special version called Deathscythe-Hell.  Said friend gets me into an aol chatroom RPG, but I have to change my name to something related to the gundam I want to play.  Hellscythe sounds good.  It&#39;s taken, so I add 83 to it.  There&#39;s Hellscythe83.  I ended up never playing the game, but the aol account stuck ^_^;  Now comes the old m-r.com board.  I need a name.  I was going to just use Hellscythe83, but then my brother suggests that since I&#39;m going to be ranching I should change it to raiser.  Bam, Hellraiser83 is born.  I spent a brief time as CPraiser83, but this name is definitely going to stick.

 I picked Endless Vision because when my parents were in the midst of getting divorced, all I heard was fighting and screaming and I couldn&#39;t take it anymore. So I would sit in my room and just close my eyes and imagine. I would imagine about such awesome things, and it seemed almost as if it were a &#34;vision&#34;. And since I never wanted to leave and go back to the real world, I would hope it would be &#34;endless&#34;. Thus, comes the name Endless Vision.

 Ok,buckle up, it&#39;s going to be a bumpy ride! <BR>So my best friend has been playing HalfLife online and is part of a clan called the Brotherhood of Pain{BoP}. Then he and his buddies start using their clan names for other stuff. We join a medevil renenactment group called DagorHir. <BR>My friend wants to start his own faction{BoP}. I want to join said faction, and need a name. So my other friend suggests Mangle because of my vicious, unrelenting style of fighting. <BR> <BR>Mangle: verb, to crush, maul, grind, or cut roughly and repeatedly; to fold laundry&#91;see horror film &#34;The Mangler&#34;&#93; <BR> <BR>So then we start making up ideas as to what our charecters are. <BR> Body Count: Demon,possesing the body of another charecter. <BR> Twist: Wraith, likes to destroy people&#39;s minds. Plague: Unknown. <BR> Mangle: Unspeakable Horror, built out of parts still twitching after large inter-species conflict.  <BR> <BR>I have also gone by Zyko{psyko} and Coyote, but will not be using the name Coyote anymore because one of my new friend&#39;s real name is Coyote Laughs At The Devil. <BR> <BR>I too consider myself something of a Goth, but get sick of the pretentious trendy bull$#!&#43; that Goths must always be gloomy,pale,bored-with-everything,elitist snobs. That steriotype died with those stupid punks in Columbine, who ruined Goth for the rest of us! <BR> <BR>I live in Florida,and am Multi-Ethnic, a deathly palor does not come naturally to me.The local Goths would not acept me as one of their&#39;s, so I took on a sort of Grunge/Goth look, it works for me. <BR> <BR>Coyote, BTW, introduced me to Voltaire&#39;s music and it rocks! <BR> <BR>P.S. Ender, I thought that was where you got that name!

 My name naturally comes from the Final Fantasy series; I am a huge fan of it, particularly the old-school games and FFX. Moogles are small, white, cat-like creatures with wings &#40;usually red&#41; and a furry pom-pom like thing on their head. If I recall correctly, moogle in Japanese is Mogryu, which means cat-bat. Yeah. Someone may be able to correct me there, though.

 My name came from a show called Cowboy Bebop about bounty hunters that used to be on Adult Swim. My sister got me to watch it. In one episode, theres an old guy who has never lost at chess. THen he plays vitrual chess with a wierd 12 year old girl on board the bounty hunters ship. it ends in a draw then he dies. How sad. His name was Chessmater hex, but I didnt know that due to the buildup of earwax that obscures my hearing and makes things sound all jumbled together.

 my name came from the name of a rpg character I created back in 1987. My baby sister had a friend and told me &#34;I&#39;m going to tell you a name,and I&#39;m going to ask you in a few years what his name is. His name is Tilimicus Nix.&#34; I said ok. <BR> One of my fellow gamers &#40;and best friend&#41; thought it would be cool if our characters were brothers. His character &#40;Mace Shun-Di {pronounced shun dee}&#41; was already in play,and I figured it would be an easy way to remember the name.Tilimicus Shun-Di was born.

 Daegen is kinda round about, but here it is anyways. I was looking for a name to use on World of Warcraft and every other MMO I play, and wanted something original. So, I got out my huge webster dictionary. I looked through for cool words, and thought &#34;Dagger&#34; is pretty cool. So I looked it up, and took the root Gaelic &#40;ancient Scottish and Irish&#41; for that word, which is Daga, and then stylised it.
