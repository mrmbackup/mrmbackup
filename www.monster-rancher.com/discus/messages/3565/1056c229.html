I hate to boast, but I am the ultimate master. I have looked through almost EVERY thread &#40;With the exception of those stupid stories&#41; and have decided to share my wealth of knowledge. Just ask me any question, and I will answer it through your e-mail. SO MAKE SURE YOU DON&#39;T USE ANY FAKE E-MAIL ADDRESSES!! And if I am not 100% sure, I will direct you to a page or pages that will tell you with absolute certanty. And please... no tech questions. Those are very time consuming and pointless. For alot of those, go to:  <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Maze/6761/mr2.htm" TARGET="_top">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Maze/6761/mr2.htm</A>  <BR> <BR>That is my first helpful hint.  <BR> <BR>-- Jimmy Cooper &#40;<A HREF="mailto:duckman18@hotmail.com">duckman18@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, April 02, 2000  <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Answers</B></FONT> <BR> <BR>Mind telling me how the game determines monsters from CD&#39;s?

This may be kinda dumb for a question, but say I burn a CD that I borrowed from someone...the original gives me an Undine, will the burned one give me an Undine too? Or no monster at all? Also, what about mixed CDs that I make up myself? Hmmm... Just wondering because I&#39;m torn between getting a digital camera and a CD- R.. but if the CD burner gives me cool monsters then I&#39;ll get that!

It&#39;s okay to make a single backup copy of anything you legitimately own, for your own private uses as protection for the original. By the way, does anybody know the answer to B&#39;s question? I&#39;d like to know, too!  <BR> <BR>-- locke &#40;<A HREF="mailto:iti@gate.net">iti@gate.net</A>&#41;, April 03, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Locke, it is an internet rumor that backups are ok, and many pirate sites repeat this lie in an attempt to sell their illegal wares. They are a violation of Sony&#39;s License agreement.

Wow! I guess you&#39;re sure... that&#39;s quite a shock. I&#39;ve been in video production for a long time, and the rules must be quite different for CD&#39;s as for videos. Man, that&#39;s amazing!

I meant &#34;the rules must be quite different for CD&#39;s as opposed to Video&#34;. It didn&#39;t sound right the first time. Also, are we talking about the same thing? Specifically, the creation by yourself, for nobody&#39;s use but yourself, of a copy to use so that your original won&#39;t be damaged by accident? I&#39;m not questioning your knowledge, just trying to make sure I understand correctly.

You will need to check the details for each game you purchase... for example, many PC games allow you to make a backup, provided that only one copy of the game is in use at any one time. Many companies do NOT allow this any more, but it used to be general practice.  <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell &#40;apparatus@@juno.com&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>I spent 5 years managing a popular videogame/computer software store you might see in a mall.

The more pirates you turn in the better!  <BR> <BR>Eagle Fierce, nowhere did Lisa imply that the pirates that she &#34;ratted out&#34; were her friends. Pirates are basically leaches, who suck the profit away from companies and individuals who would otherwise benefit. They have lots of excuses as to why what they do is OK, but it all comes down to the fact that they are thieves. If a person takes a shirt from a store that he can not afford, it is theft. Just because the original copy of the software is still there does not reduce the fact that the software has been taken without permission, or being paid for. &#40;A rant from someone who&#39;s job was nearly destroyed by pirates.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Argos, you can not copyright DNA. You can attempt to patent it, but the whole question of that is still up in the air. There is a legal case of a doctor who patented a substance that he found in one of his patients blood, and then proceeded to have the courts forbid the patient to give blood. That case has been appealed, and is still up in the air, and the doctor is in a very large law suit over the issue. The law has yet to decide who owns your DNA, and if it even can be patented &#40;as opposed to the gene manipulations that they are doing now, which can.&#41; Of course, if he could, Bill Gates would love to own everyoned DNA. It&#39;s the ultimate monopoly.  <BR> <BR>-Berge  <BR> <BR>-- Berge &#40;<A HREF="mailto:rellis@bigidea.com">rellis@bigidea.com</A>&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Thank you for the correction,Berge.You seem to know a lot about copyrights and patents.And I agree about the pirates.Although you could put promoters,agents, and some companies in the leeches catagory.  <BR> <BR>-- Argos &#40;<A HREF="mailto:stanrock@uwm.edu">stanrock@uwm.edu</A>&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Have you noticed Jimmy Cooper hasn&#39;t answered any of the questions here and hardly ever answers question threads?  <BR> <BR>-- Dark Jester X &#40;<A HREF="mailto:darkjester56@yahoo.com">darkjester56@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>First off, I answer all messages by e-mail, and secondly...  <BR> <BR>Not that I don&#39;t enjoy your conversatation, but this thread was designed to help newbies... not discuss copyright laws.  <BR> <BR>-- Jimmy Cooper &#40;<A HREF="mailto:duckman18@hotmail.com">duckman18@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>The subject does seem to have drifted a bit. But honestly, this is fascinating, and I&#39;m learning much more from the direction it&#39;s taken. From his posts in the archives, I have a tremendous respect for Eagle, but if I had put a major part of my life into a labor of love &#40;or just had a flash of profitable insight&#41; I&#39;d appreciate Lisa for telling me when someone&#39;s stealing my effort and possibly my living. None of my copyrighted work is particularly valuable, but in a manner of speaking, it&#39;s all my children, and it would hurt to see it taken. The stand Lisa has taken is difficult, and she need offer no apologies. Bravo, Lisa!  <BR> <BR>-- locke &#40;<A HREF="mailto:iti@gate.net">iti@gate.net</A>&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t rat on my friends... I found people who were copying software and selling it to small businesses as real &#40;for big bucks, Quark isn&#39;t cheap&#41;, I found people on the web &#40;over 100 of them&#41; stupid enough to put everything including their home addresses on their site advertising PSX copies for $12 a pop, I turned in a bunch of people on ebay who provided ample info on their auction site, I found &#34;frequent returners&#34; in my store who were burning and selling &#40;some of them actually trying to sell their CDs in my store to other customers&#41;, I also found employees of my own company &#34;borrowing&#34; &#40;an employee priviledge&#41; PSX games and selling the copies under the table at my store.  <BR> <BR>You may still ask, why bother?  <BR> <BR>Well, I see the piracy all around me. Some estimates are that close to 10 million burned PSX games were sold last year. And the fact of the matter is that the piracy doesn&#39;t just hurt the software development companies, the distributers, the retailers, and all the people that could be employed by these firms..... Piracy affects the game industry in a more fundamental way. The average PSX game sells about 30,000 copies during it&#39;s time on the shelf. If it sells less than 10,000 it is a failure and may not earn back it&#39;s development and advertising costs. If people get burned copies instead of buying the real game, Sony and the game development house don&#39;t know the true popularity of the game. &#40;By the way, the MR series is considered a marginal, cult, title.&#41; They may never make a sequel, because they don&#39;t think it&#39;s selling well! Overall, the plummetting costs of burners have created the PSX selection you know today. Right now they&#39;re gearing up for Madden 2001 and Resident Evil 12, and Tomb Raider 47, but the odd games from small companies are falling by the wayside. This is particularly true for PSX 2. The costs of developing for that system are so high &#40;the tools cost millions&#41; that no company is willing to risk making a game that&#39;s too different or experimental. Back when the PSX was new, &#40;and the 486 was big&#41; burners cost $600 and we saw games like Discworld, Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, and Auquanaut&#39;s Holiday. Not that these are the best games ever, but they opened the doors for other experiences in gaming. My favorite example is the original Tomb Raider game. Before it came out, people saw screen shots and demos, and dismissed it as a &#34;game for young girls&#34;. No one believed that men would stand for a female lead character. Core, the company working on it was just five guys with really no funding. Today, that game would never make it to press, too risky! As long as people are able to steal games instead of buying them, the variety of available games will continue to shrink into a bland, middle-of-the-road, no risks taken, selection encompassing a few well defined genres.  <BR> <BR>I want better. I want people to know how just how popular my faves really are! If MR1 &amp;2 had sold more copies at retail &#40;instead of the black market&#41; we&#39;d definitely see TECMO working much harder at MR3, MR Dreamcast, toys, etc,  <BR> <BR>-- Lisa Shock &#40;<A HREF="mailto:LisaShock@ignmail.com">LisaShock@ignmail.com</A>&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>why is the sky blue?  <BR> <BR>-- BooBoo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:primaltron@yahoo.com">primaltron@yahoo.com</A>&#41;, April 04, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>Jimmy whats wrong with the stories its not like were pros or something you dont have to read them but you dont have to go around sayin thier stupid,I would useually be swearin my ass off at u by now but I think I want u to read this post cuz this will be the last time Ill ever be nice to u!Its War from here on!  <BR> <BR>-- Rion Beyolve &#40;<A HREF="mailto:twopaclives@hotmail.com">twopaclives@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, April 05, 2000.  <BR> <BR><HR WIDTH=75% SIZE=2> <BR> <BR>I have nothing agenst stories, but I think they should have their place somewhere else!

 Talking about piracy... Oopss!!  Let&#39;s see... Sony might ask me for a few million $ in fine if they found out how many CDs I did make copy.... shshshshshshsss :&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>About MR serries,  we can make copy, yes, but we cannot play it the rite way in PSX.  The copied CD won&#39;t load disc stone &#40;i.e. other CDs&#41;  That&#39;s why I have a burner but, still, had to buy MR2 CD :&#41;

 Yes, it will, I saw my friend do it once. <BR>I understand, although not sure, that it is very difficult to burn dreamcast CDs. If that is true than why is it that I hear PXS II cds are just as easy to burn as PSX cds. Could this info not be correct or is it because more people will buy PSX II over dreamcast if they make you think that it is possible to burn thier CDs. The PC industry has had to put up with piracy for ever, but their still around. It&#39;s almost like its included in thier marketing because their are ways around pirateing. Maybe they let people pirate their stuff so they can collect $300,000.00 from everyone once their caught. I don&#39;t have a burner or too much knowledge of the video game industry but find this thread rather interesting. Well what do you guys think?

Here is what it asked:  <BR> <BR>Well, here are some unresolved mysteries: <BR>  <BR>Which sub breeds unlock which techniques for which monsters and how does that monster learn that technique? ie Pixe/Hare learning 1-2 punch.  <BR> <BR>What is the &#34;real&#34; effect of the Tauros Horn?  <BR> <BR>What monster has it&#39;s fatique and stress reduced by the prescense of the Gold Ingot?  <BR> <BR>How do you alter Dages opinion of a monster combination?  <BR> <BR>What is the &#34;real&#34; effect of the Dino&#39;s Tail?  <BR> <BR>How do you get your monster to show &#34;resistance&#34;? <BR>  <BR>What is the &#34;real&#34; effect of the hero and heel badge?  <BR> <BR>When a ColorPandora does &#34;Unity&#34; during battle, what effect does that have?  <BR> <BR>And then a softball: what are the requirements for a mock learning &#34;Energy Steal&#34;?  <BR> <BR>-- Farmer Jimbo &#40;<A HREF="mailto:honcho7@excite.com">honcho7@excite.com</A>&#41;, April 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>ummm,, about the sky and being blue,...... the sky is not blue because of moleclues and radiation,... it&#39;s blue during the day because in our atmosphere, there are uncountable tiny drops of water that simply stay there in the water cycle. these are the same tiny water droplets that make clouds and rain. well with the sun overhead, each of these droplets acts as a tiny prizm, separating the different colors in the rays of beautiful sunshine. because of the molecular shape of water, and the water tension, all but blue is reflected back. that is why the sky is blue, and at night, or at dusk, when the color changes, it is because the angle that the sunlight is hitting the water has changed, and therefore separates the light differently, giving us the brilliant display we see each and every night.  <BR>so there  <BR> <BR>-- Foster &#40;<A HREF="mailto:chatmane@aol.com">chatmane@aol.com</A>&#41;, April 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>WOW thanks a lot Foster I really really needed that info now I can play better monster rancher and maybe beat the game thanks a lot Awsome info!  <BR> <BR>-- Rion Beyolve &#40;<A HREF="mailto:twopaclives@hotmail.com">twopaclives@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, April 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>wouldn&#39;t it be better if this self-proclaimed &#34;ultimate master&#34; would type his responses here, and not through e-mail, so that everybody, including the newbies, could know and judge just how &#34;good&#34; this bastard really is?  <BR> <BR>-- eViLfAtbOy &#40;<A HREF="mailto:organomd@hvisions.com">organomd@hvisions.com</A>&#41;, April 11, 2000.  <BR> <BR>First off, I know a lot of stuff, but only information that has been discovered. Although I have my theroes...  <BR> <BR>Q&#41;Which sub breeds unlock which techniques for which monsters and how does that monster learn that technique? ie Pixe/Hare learning 1-2 punch.  <BR> <BR>A&#41; I belive that when a monster has it&#39;s attack as it&#39;s FORTE it maybe be carried on to a certain type of monster.  <BR> <BR>Q&#41;What is the &#34;real&#34; effect of the Tauros Horn?  <BR> <BR>A&#41; I think the Tauros Horn lowers your chance of getting attacked after an errantry.  <BR> <BR>Q&#41;What monster has it&#39;s fatique and stress reduced by the prescense of the Gold Ingot? <BR> <BR>A&#41; The most obvious would be the GOld Suezo, but I cannot be sure. I tend to belive that Gali&#39;s are more likely.  <BR> <BR>Q&#41;How do you alter Dages opinion of a monster combination?  <BR> <BR>A&#41; Changing his comments are quite easy when you know how. First off, fine two brand new monsters &#40;Off different breed or sub&#41; that have about the same stat points. Not actual points, but levels. ie. GOLEM has best POW, then DEF and so on. And find another monster &#40;Preferable not the same type of golem&#41; that would have the same levels. Ie. Poe is best, then Def and all the rest are in the same order. And then raise them so they always have the same levels. ie: 1st monster 2nd Monster pow 999 666 def 888 555 spd 777 444 ski 666 333 int 555 222 life 444 111 Even though they are not the SAME, they are the same order. Also, try combining of the 1st of April. That helps a bit....  <BR> <BR>Q&#41;What is the &#34;real&#34; effect of the Dino&#39;s Tail?  <BR> <BR>A&#41; I belive the Dino&#39;s Tail raises the chance of fighting an enemy after an errantry.  <BR> <BR>Q&#41;How do you get your monster to show &#34;resistance&#34;?  <BR> <BR>A&#41; As far as I know, this was an error in the game. It is when your monster shows the &#34;I don&#39;t like this&#34; action, but it is never put in the monsters info. Thats just my oppinion...  <BR> <BR>Q&#41;What is the &#34;real&#34; effect of the hero and heel badge?  <BR> <BR>A&#41;The Hero badge will make a monster become more loyal&#40;And good&#41;, while the heel will make them un-loyal&#40;and evil&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Q&#41;When a ColorPandora does &#34;Unity&#34; during battle, what effect does that have?  <BR> <BR>A&#41; I hate ColorPandora&#39;s and have never got UNITY, but I belive it raises their best attack&#40;at Off Of CD levels&#41; 3X.  <BR> <BR>Q&#41;And then a softball: what are the requirements for a mock learning &#34;Energy Steal&#34;?  <BR> <BR>A&#41; Well this can simply be found at any Tech chain site, and I hate doing tech questions. It&#39;s just pointless. But try the site I posted above. It might have it. I&#39;m not sure...  <BR> <BR>IS THAT THE BEST YOU GOT?!?  <BR> <BR>-- Jimmy Cooper &#40;<A HREF="mailto:duckman18@hotmail.com">duckman18@hotmail.com</A>&#41;, April 12, 2000.

 Okay, &#34;Master,&#34; time to take you down a notch.  The Tauros Horn is used in combinations to make the less likely results more likely.  In other words, if you put together a Naga/Worm with a Zuum/Gali, you&#39;d have a way better chance of getting a Gali/Worm than without the Horn.  And it&#39;s not just a rumor: try putting two monsters together without the Horn, look at the percentages, than back out and try it with the Horn.  You should see a noticeable difference. <BR> <BR>And just so you know, a TRUE master is someone who isn&#39;t so full of himself that he can&#39;t stop to answer questions from less-informed like the rest of us who&#39;ve been on the board for over half a year, like RNA, Miss Carrie, Dark Phoenix, and yours truly.

 To John Doe <BR> <BR>I dont think u can burn DC disc &#40;not CD!!&#41; with CD burner.  DC uses GD &#40;disc that can contain up to 1 Gigabyte&#41; and CDR has only 650MB &#40;some new types on market can contain up to 800MB,&#41;  also there is no GD burner. <BR> <BR>and if u say PSX2 is more easier than DC disc to copy then... hmmm YES and NO :&#41; <BR> <BR>PSX2 uses DVD, the cost of a blank DVD is about $50 and I m not sure the burner price &#40;a few thousand!?!?!&#41;  U can copy PSX2 disc but is it worth it? NO hehehe
