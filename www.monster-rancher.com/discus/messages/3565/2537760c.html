 I have a delicate question to ask.  Why is there so much unspoken animosity between the different message boards and websites for Monster Rancher?  Specifically the long standing feud between www.monster-rancher.com and monster-rancher-metropolis.com.  I understand the desire for healthy competition.  I also recognize that some people like to establish an exclusive loyalty to one site or another.  What I don’t understand is the taboo against cooperative linking between all boards. <BR> <BR>I basically have two questions.  What happened in the past that makes it almost criminal to mention one board on another?  It’s gonna be a year before we see MR3 and I propose that without cooperation, neither board will be successful by next fall.  Secondly, why do I feel like the only one who doesn’t play favorites and participates in both forums?  It’s fun for me to see how the same post evolves differently on the two boards. <BR> <BR>I whish I could more eloquently state my questions on this matter, but I’ll settle for this clumsy start to get the discussion going.

 Well, I&#39;m not certain of this, but I believe that the &#34;feud&#34; between the two boards began when Bennet and Fade went their own ways.  However, since Bennet is not in control of this site, and Fade rarely appears at MR.com &#40;from what I&#39;ve seen&#41;, I see no reason that a co-op wouldn&#39;t work.  Perhaps, Lisa may be able to shed more light on the subject.

 Well, I barely know what you are talking about, since I never went to that other site. But some told me about it. What I can say is that MR is a game, and no game is worth feuding seriously over.

 I don&#39;t understand the feud either.  I have benefited from frequenting both boards in the past.  We need not carry on Bennet&#39;s and Fade&#39;s feud.  I find it to be pointless now.  I will remain neutral in any dispute between the two.

I recall heated words between Fade and Bennett last fall, in posts on B&#39;s board. I have no idea what may or may not have happened between them. I became an admin in February 2000, but was not privy to a lot of board business. Then, of course, everything fell apart on April 11, and I started this board on April 16. <BR> <BR>I have never corresponded with Fade or any of his moderators, so I know very little about them apart from their public statements. <BR> <BR>Since both the monster-rancher.com website and the attached xianaix ezboard and  Board #2 are not COPPA compliant, I have chosen not to post anything there. This is purely a matter personal preference, and a bit of preservation for this board. My activities have to be held to higher standard, as federal agents are currently combing the web for sites of interest to children that are not following the new regulations, and I want to make it clear that this site is very much in compliance. &#40;Recent judicial decisions have penalized websites for linking to other sites involved in activities in violation of federal law.&#41; <BR> <BR>As long as people who post here are polite, positive, and encourage honest research - I really don&#39;t have any prejudice about where they&#39;re &#34;from&#34;. I have enjoyed seeing input from a wide variety of contributers including you Farmer Jimbo, Dark Phoenix, Nevistar, Azn Beast, Petit-Trot, and many, many others. As I have often said before, what we have built here, and what we have the potential to build in the future, is far greater than what any one of us could have built alone. I look forward to an interesting future!

 I, for one, don&#39;t go to the other site for the most part. I have nothing against Fade&#39;s site &#40;and have peeked there more than once&#41;, but I don&#39;t tend to post to more places than I have time to do. After the baby&#39;s born, I&#39;ll probably scan it over and see what I could contribute to it. That is, as long as the feud doesn&#39;t end up going into rediculous proportions, either on this side or on Fade&#39;s side.

 Hey all.  It is I Fade.  I would just like to state I have no problems with this board and never have.  I personally am just never here due to time.  I dont have enough of it to use this board.  I dont even read 50% of the forums on my board.  Anyway BC and me never had a fight so I dont know what that is about.  Mabey BC had some feelings toward me he never expressed and he only told Lisa but I am not sure what those would of been or why.  Anyway I am just glad this board is around.  The more Monster Rancher stuff online the more everybody benifits!

As I recall, although apparently no one saved the thread from being destroyed by Bobby Fatman, &#40;And with 38,000 messages at the time of the attack, having a great recollection of all of them is impossible.&#41;there was a lively debate regarding B&#39;s management of the board with regards to B&#39;s allowing &#34;methods&#34; &#40;DP&#39;s was new.&#41;, and detailed values &#40;some derived from gameshark use&#41; attached to parts of the game to be publicly posted. That&#39;s the last &#39;Fade &amp; Bennett&#39; interaction I ever saw.

 sorry i&#39;ve been off-line.  i was probably the one by-stander who is still around who visited both boards last october.  well, i visited fade&#39;s as often as my machine would let me - the graphics rich front page used to flummox my poor computer. <BR> <BR>there was an angry thread at greenspun last october involving b campbell and xainiax about how fade &#34;stole&#34; something without attribution.  although fade&#39;s ezboard still bears xainiax&#39;s name, i don&#39;t think it was the board itself - i think it was some info.  i didnt understand it fully at the time, and i sure dont now - especially since i have seen xainiax post at m-r.com without rancor.  it seems to be one of those old feuds where the feud became more important than the reason it began. <BR> <BR>i speak cheerfully with fade and his henchmen&#91;^_^&#93; at tecmo.  i am in favor of detente, and an end to the cold war.  however, one thing i have noticed.  m-r.com admins do NOT post on this board.  i have posted once, tony has posted, dark phoenix posts regularly at m-r.com.  name me the m-r.com admin who has posted on this board.  berge used to post all the time here; then he became an admin at m-r.com and now he no longer posts here.  from the outside at least, there appears to be at least a &#34;gentleman&#39;s agreement&#34; that fade&#39;s workers do not post here.  until there is some two way movement, i will feel very awkward posting there. <BR> <BR>this board is my home.  this board has a very different personality than m-r.com. its strengths are different; its weaknesses are different.  i spend time coming up with ideas to help this board stay better than that board; i see evidence that they do the same.  farmer jimbo and dark phoenix, quite honestly, it is for you we do it.  think twice before you seriously propose some sort of &#34;joa&#34; between the two boards; trust me, you would not like the result as much as you like the current situation.  competition is the american way, and a very good way it is!

 Wow, and I was worried that no one would reply to this topic!  Again, this&#39;ll have to be short due to real world issues sapping a lot of time right now. <BR> <BR>I am in no way proposing a merging or combination of any of the web sites or boards out there right now.  I thoroughly enjoy the differences in style and personality between the all the MR boards out there.  I agree that healthy competition is a good thing and has helped both boards in the past.  What I&#39;m talking about is two-fold: <BR> <BR>Where are the links?  If the purpose of a hypothetical MR board is to be THE source of MR related info, one of the key components should be a comprehensive and up to date list of links.  The true strengths of the internet is the ability to link related sites to each other.  I consider the two aforementioned boards to the premiere sites for MR related info.  Why is there no link between the two?  Fade&#39;s is out of date, Lisa&#39;s is a voluntary web ring.  Neither site can claim that they have the best and most up-to-date list of links.  I would think that this would be a worthy goal of any site. <BR> <BR>Where&#39;s the cross-pollination?  In the past, it seemed like every other week someone would post: &#34;Hey, I just read this on the other board so what do you guys think?&#34;  Those types of posts have disappeared.  Now I know that new discoveries aren&#39;t popping up like they used to, so there&#39;s less reason for this type of post.  That doesn&#39;t quite explain the death of people posting on both boards.  Foster&#39;s exact pressing of the rares project seems like a perfect way for all MR fans to contribute.  Because of the entrenchment of the two camps, I&#39;m sure that he never even considered recruiting help from other message boards.  ZappoHisbane was approaching this project from another direction with his “Rare monster abilities” thread, but I bet he has never even heard of the other board, much less consider getting help there. <BR> <BR>My original point was concern over the inevitable attrition between now and next fall.  I’m not asking people to give up their loyalties.  I am asking why there can’t be a little cooperation for the good of MR fans in general.

Hi, this is Richard Ryley, the other admin at Fade&#39;s site. I don&#39;t post here because I&#39;m not registered, and that&#39;s mainly because all of my time is spent on MR.com, and I have no time for anything else. I barely have time for Tecmo&#39;s site, but I do post there, and of course you can talk to me there if you wish. <BR> <BR>I decided to post here, though, because of Jimbo&#39;s post. He is right, this is important, and this is something that all of MR.com&#39;s admins should comment on, if only because, as so many of you have pointed out, we spend so little time here. <BR> <BR>Fade may not remember the argument, but I do. I remember how much it hurt all of us, and how completely meaningless it was. I don&#39;t go into great detail here because I don&#39;t know all of what went on. But I do know that it was all a misunderstanding. From Fade&#39;s post, I would guess that he and BC have forgotten all about whatever hurt feelings they might have had, and probably we should, too. <BR> <BR>I posted this on MR.com. This is an exact copy of what I posted: <BR> <BR>I think that there are three things involved here: <BR> <BR>One is simply that folks don&#39;t have a lot of time, and have chosen one or the other. It isn&#39;t laziness, I don&#39;t want to call it that, but it is true that there was more cross posting in the early days. As you said, Fade&#39;s links have fallen out of date, people have stopped visiting both boards, those in charge of one have lost interest in the other.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not worried about that, though, because there are still plenty of people who do visit both boards. I know that Dark Phoenix can be counted on to post whatever he has learned here, and I assume &#40;because you bring it up&#41; that you are a regular on both boards, too. Plus, there is now Tecmo&#39;s board. Although on one level it is a competition for the both of us, on the other it is a meeting place, where we both can be sure to run into each other because we would both like to talk to Tecmo&#39;s representatives. <BR> <BR>Second, as I said about Tecmo&#39;s board, there undoubtedly is some competition between our two boards. We are competing over the same base of MR fans, and each of us would like to present, if we can, a slightly different image of ourselves to those fans. I like to think of MR.com as a friendlier board, while MRM is more technical, savvy, but not as interested in the kind of &#34;fooling around&#34; that we do here. <BR> <BR>One person has already said that he agrees with my concept of MR.com. Then again, I&#39;m not saying that MRM is unfriendly. And of course, in a competitive sense it would be better for us to be the SAME, both of us attracting the entire fan base rather than trying to pander to one group or another. Ultimately, I leave this to those in authority. I like to think that this is a friendly board because I take steps to make it so. My style is different from others, which is a good thing. Competition itself is good, it encourages individuality and creativity. <BR> <BR>Finally, though, you are right about there being some bad blood. There are some, unfortunately, who cannot forgive, either some imagined slight, or something that really happened. This is something that I&#39;ve tried to speak out against, and in this regard, I am all for conversations like this one, to bring things out into the open, and try to put some of this childishness behind us. <BR> <BR>There have been some mistakes. Fade&#39;s comment about having to remove the link to BC&#39;s site is an example. That was a MAJOR disaster for the relationship between these two boards, and it was brought about by a manipulative host who was trying to use Fade for his own ends. Fade finally had to remove his board from the host, despite the fact that it left us without a message board, because the host was posting ads for pornographic sites. <BR> <BR>Of course, the attitude of BC and those on his board were anything but forgiving. Fade was foolish to trust the host of his board, but BC was foolish to blame Fade for his host&#39;s selfishness. This, I think, has been the foundation for the &#34;feud&#34; between us. And the feud is fairly simple: We characterized BC&#39;s board as a domain of children and troublemakers, and BC&#39;s folks described us as newbies, trying to &#34;cash in&#34; on Monster Rancher. <BR> <BR>Note: If looked at in the proper way, this perception can be seen as in keeping with the &#34;positive&#34; way in which our own boards are seen. If MR.com is friendly and open, then MRM must be self-serving and aloof. And if MRM is technically proficient and knowledgable, then MR.com must be out of date and incorrect. <BR> <BR>The problem is, of course, this is nonsense. A few very loud individuals have, for their own reasons, put forth this idea that MR.com and MRM are &#34;at war&#34; with one another. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am very impressed with MRM&#39;s new structure and appearance since the death of BC&#39;s board. And their administrators seem to be very helpful and supportive, just as BC for the most part was.  <BR> <BR>Now, I&#39;m not saying that MR.com doesn&#39;t cut down MRM. All I know is that I haven&#39;t heard it. But I &#42;HAVE&#42; heard people from MRM come over here and insult us for being &#34;newbies&#34;. My attitude towards that is what it has always been: These petty, childish wars between ANY two groups in a fandom do nothing but hurt the fandom as a whole.  <BR> <BR>Richard Ryley - <A HREF="mailto:ryley@phan.org">ryley@phan.org</A>

 I&#39;m not registered either, so I&#39;ll have to be anonymous for the moment.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m NK, one of Fade&#39;s mods. I&#39;d just like to say that I&#39;ve never been here because, to be honest, I found this board a little confusing. After using the oh-so simple EZboard for so long, I simply didn&#39;t understand this one &#40;I&#39;m an idiot, sue me &#42;G&#42;&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, I would like to congratulate Jimbo. He&#39;s gotten three people, by my count, from Fade&#39;s board to come here, when they wouldn&#39;t have otherwise.  <BR> <BR>::Claps::

 Yeah NK you aren&#39;t the only one. After coming here from Lusenet it was way confusing. I was starting to get annoyed after a while not having cookies and all. It&#39;s a lot easier once you learn and then you never forget. Sort of like HTML. be seein&#39; ya  <BR>/0&#62; ^-^ &#60;0&#92;

 I&#39;d give you a detailed explanation but my bowling team is going to kill me if i&#39;m late &#40;I have to buy the first round this week&#41;. <BR> <BR>Go back to the main page &#40;topics command to the right&#41;.

 This is kind of ironic.  A thread about the &#34;bad blood&#34; between the two boards is seeming to cause a small reunion.  Anyone else care to contribute? ^_^

Whatever &#34;username&#34; you type in the box will show up as your name, you do NOT have to be &#34;anonymous&#34; unless you want to be. If you want your email linked, type it in. The password box is for those who have accounts, but because the cookie system is only useful if you&#39;re posting a lot of messages in one session, most regulars here don&#39;t have accounts. There&#39;s a description of the system in the Office of the Mayor section, Forum Business FAQ, but I strongly recommend against getting an account unless you&#39;re a big CD list contributer.

 Well...I don&#39;t really have much to say. I hang out around the Library mostly, and I stray from confrontations usually. The onlt problem I ever had was one small fight with Eagle Fierce at the old board. Wasn&#39;t even a fight really, but I guess I took a little offense to it. Ahh well, that board and thread are long, gone, and dead. I got better places to go, more interseting people to meet, and some serious epics that are honing my writing talents. &#40;or so I hope&#41; However, I shall not lie. I kinda stumbled on B&#39;s baord, hung out a while, and did my best to help during the Fat-arse attacks. I got accepted into this....&#39;guild&#39; you could say and kinda hung around here ever sense. I did not even realize that MR.com even existed. In light of this, I do believe it is worth checking out.

 From my experience, I honestly cannot say that one site is better than the other.  The two MB&#39;s both have their own distinctive styles and flavors.  Actually it comes down to personal preference.  It&#39;s kinda like having two groups friends that you like to be with for different reasons.  Like hanging with one batch friends for stimulating intellectual conversation on one hand and the gang you hang with at the bowling alley on Friday nights &#40;or whatever, I don&#39;t get out much&#41;.  In my analysis, it come down to mood and personal taste.

 I guess the main reason for me not posting here &#40;other than me being so confused ^__^&#41; would be that I don&#39;t know anyone, and given my reputation on Fade&#39;s board, I feel more comfortable there. But, now that I&#39;m not confused, and I know that Jimbo&#39;s here, I&#39;ll certainly be sticking around.

Thanks for the info about the usernames, I didn&#39;t know that. I think that I will continue to post as &#34;Anonymous&#34;, though, because I&#39;m here so seldom, and because of my past experiences with impersonators. I would rather everyone question whether any message that claims to be from me really is, even this one. &#42;G&#42; <BR> <BR>Richard Ryley - <A HREF="mailto:ryley@phan.org">ryley@phan.org</A>

 I don&#39;t really care one way or the other, it&#39;s your choice about the name you use. The moderating staff can see IPs, and have instructions to delete posts by impostors. Anyone who impostors gets a warning email, and if they persist, they get IP banned. &#40;This sounds harsh, but after some of the things imposters did to try and tarnish other people&#39;s names, it only seems the only fair way to respect everyone&#39;s integrity.&#41; <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I configured the board to offer the &#34;Anonymous&#34; option, and I can remove the option at any time. So far, no one has abused it, so I&#39;m content to leave the option running.  <BR> <BR>Anyway, glad to see you guys made it over! Look around, have fun! &#40;There&#39;s a Metalner fiction contest ending on 9/30, you still have a time to get in an entry! ^_~&#41;

 Since we&#39;re all friends, now, I have a confession to make.  As I stated, I have visited the MR.com board several times, but I have also posted twice.  A month or two ago, I tried a little too obviously to get some of your &#40;MR.com&#41; attention.  You probably don&#39;t remember me, but I went by EF and Z3Convertible.  I&#39;d like to take the time to apologise for that, now.  Anyways, that&#39;s in the past, and I think that we all have a brighter future as better friends &#40;WOW!  Don&#39;t &#34;I&#34; sound like I&#39;m on crack! ^_^&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also, I have to concurr with what DP said about the different personalities that hang around on the board.  We are more formal, and I actually prefer it that way &#40;I&#39;m not the best in meaningless chat...I get confused too easily :P&#41;.  Still, we&#39;re not an exclusive group, and I&#39;m certain that I speak for all of us when I say that we&#39;re always suseptable to change, and glad to have a new poster. ^_^  Welcome to the board, Ninja Kato and thanks for stopping by RR.

 One final note, we are more &#34;free wheeling&#34;, as Eagle Fierce said, but we are also closed. No posts from unregistered members. Maybe it&#39;s just that we feel more like goofing around because we have a sense of &#34;privacy&#34;. &#40;Imagined or not &#42;G&#42;&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, I think I&#39;m going to wander off again.

 Ohh yeah, imposters can&#39;t hit under your name too often. Lisa can check to see if it came from your computer or not. Maybe thats only if you sign up, but someone in my house did something on here once under my name. <BR> <BR>Never found out who.....

 Yay!  I used to come here to post, but lost the site when my hard drive at work was changed.  I never managed to find my way back, and so stayed at Fade&#39;s board.  But I have the address now, so here I am again!  &#40;I also was made a moderator at Fade&#39;s board between then and now.&#41;  I was never uncomfortable coming here.  I just got busy, and then lost.  Hi Everybody!  I&#39;m back! <BR> <BR>-Berge ^_^ <BR> <BR>ps: Many thanks to Farmer Jimbo for e-mailing me, and sending me to the thread with the link. <BR> <BR>pps: We&#39;re in production again, so I won&#39;t be talking that much, but I&#39;ll at least be lurking once a day.
