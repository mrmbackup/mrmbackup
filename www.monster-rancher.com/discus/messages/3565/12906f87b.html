There was a trailer of MR5 at this year&#39;s Tokyo Game Show. There wasn&#39;t a playable version of the game. However, a numerous details have been revealed, including a special 3-on-3 battle system, character names, &#34;performance&#34; training and a promotional Anime to be released on November. <BR> <BR>The game itself has been set for a December 8th release. <BR> <BR>For more information, view this article: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/09/17/news_6133761.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/09/17/news_6133761.html</A>

 Very rarely, a game that looks truly great comes along. A game that you know will be legendary in your own heart, and possibly in others, forever. <BR> <BR>For me, my most memorable games have been ones like Final Fantasy VIII, Monster Rancher 2, The Legend Of Dragoon, and Dark Cloud 2 &#40;that&#39;s all of them, actually&#41;. The moment I layed eyes on them, I knew I would love them. The moment I played them, I knew I&#39;d love them more.  <BR> <BR>So far, everything I&#39;ve seen of MR5 has that feel. It looks as though it has a good storyline, and a similar play style to MR4 in some aspects, like the dungeons, though more detailed &#40;MR4 was great, but hardly legendary. I liked it as a game more than MR2, but it had no special moments, it became tedious, and the multiplayer set-up was flawed&#41;. <BR> <BR>All I can say is that I have gone from thinking I would hate this game, to it being my most wanted game of all time. <BR> <BR>They have betrayed tradition for innovation, the future &#91;of MR&#93; shall rise from this. <BR> <BR>Sometimes, I just can&#39;t help but be corny.

Ah, then you&#39;ll be plesantly surprised that all the character biographies are up at the official product site, along with a few screens hinting at what the game flow may be like, including exploration and training. Not to mention the name of one of the new breeds. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/mf5/index.htm" TARGET="_top">http://www.tecmo.co.jp/product/mf5/index.htm</A>

 Please pardon the double-post, but the name of the new bluish-white floaty monster with the glowing white eyes translates to &#34;Piroro&#34;.

 I especially liked the shot of the Durahan working with TWO swords.

 Actually, the Durahan was working with three. It was showing off it&#39;s dexterity by flipping a sword around with two others. Kind of like those cool balancing sticks.

 That&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing too. They&#39;re all different as well, one is like a fencing sword &#40;but bigger&#41;, one is like Cloud&#39;s Buster sword, and the other is like a watchamacallit sword, the kind in Prince of Persia &#40;...I would already bet that&#39;s going to make a special monster when the game is brought out here&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I&#39;m liking what I see more and more. The character &#34;Albert&#34; has a lot of potential with his circus freak style, but he could be annoying too. Gaufre will be cool, but should put some pants on, Tico will be annoying, Marlene and Nayuta are hott, and Jurio...well, he&#39;s not Phayne. That&#39;s a huge plus.

 Yeah, the third sword looks like a scimitar. Training monsters by making them do circus performances eh? Will these be mini-games or automatic sequences? Hmmmm.
