 Ok, Monster Rancher 2 has lots of little surprises: Binto&#39;s secret, a creepy doll that keeps moving around on its own, a dead tree springing to life, an explosion on expedition, visits from aliens, ec.  What event in MR2 surprised you the most when it happened?

 All of that stuff I took as regular game events. The one that really surprised me was when I had heard over and over how Colt never said anything new, and I thought I was already at that stage. Then one day we&#39;re at a tournament, and she smarted off to the advisors.  I can&#39;t remember which one it was, but she basically called him boring and said he should just skip the speech.  That really caught me off guard!

 I haven&#39;t unlocked all that many monsters yet, or had that many special events happen. So what surprised me was when my little Skipper decided to go do his digging thing, and dug a little too deep... <BR> <BR>That, and when my... well, one of the monters &#40;I forget which one it was, offhand... I think it was a Nankyoro &#40;sp?&#41; decided to bring back something extra from an errantry.

 pabs&#39; harsh putdown of colt during the alien episode.  this is the first time that tecmo allowed one of its &#34;authority figures&#34; to show himself as a dolt and a dunderhead...as the game went on, i found that it wasnt the last, either.

 Pabs putting on the Joker mask.Some of the other events were just as surprising,but ......gwwmphhh....gahhhh... that was hilarious! I think Locke is referring to the legends cup after your 4th or 5th visit.

I&#39;d have to agree with Argos.  I was shocked, but adored the Kato&#39;s antics... the Jell surprised me with exactly how inventive they were with him... but by far the funniest thing was Pabs the dolt going &#34;UMMMGAAAA..... GUAMMMMM&#34; with the Joker Mask.  I about fell off my bed  <BR>laughing as I watched that! <BR> <BR>I was kinda surprised that they named &#34;Whip&#34; my Jell-Zuum&#39;s Forte when he made hall-of-fame status &#40;my first Hall o&#39; Famer! yay!&#41;.  I may have used that 3 times?  Only in an  <BR>attempt to end a battle where my opponent had been down to less than 10 Life.  I expected Beam Gun at least... <BR> <BR>PezCat <BR>

 pezcat, the same thing happened to me, and there is much discussion about it buried in a thread somewhere - maybe the one about darva.  apparently, attacks used by the parents count toward forte for the offspring.

 Personally, I sat straight up the first time I saw a Joker, and the first time I heard it giggle I cringed.  I also cringed the first few times I heard a Centaur whinny in this game.

Hoppers gave you the finger. Those b&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;ds.  It should be rated M. Hehe Other than that NR2&#39;s got some of the ugliest and creepiest freaky monster in any game.  I had only seen Suezo, Mocchi and a few others, mainly from the tv show, before I had played the game.  I thought it&#39;d be filled with cute monsters.  That Hell Pierrot is something else.

 As for the Hopper giving you &#34;The Finger&#34;, it must be remembered that in Japan, where the game was created, &#34;The Finger&#34; gesture may have a much different, not to mention more polite, context.  Just as some gestures that Americans consider friendly may mean something rude and boorish in Japan.

 I was just being funny. I was kinda surprised by that though. I wonder if its really is different in japan. anyone shed a light here? the game and monsters actually doesn&#39;t have a great japanimation feel to it. not as much as pokemon anyway.  they&#39;re very varied and come from myths from all over the world.

 I think the most surprising thing would have to be that the mosters look fully grown when they&#39;re just born, except the fact that they&#39;re smaller! Suezo&#39;s don&#39;t have those cute lil&#39; ears, and Naga&#39;s have big muscles as soon as they&#39;re born! What&#39;s with that?

 I was most surprised when I found out how to unlock the Beaclon from B&#39;s old board. I couldn&#39;t believe such requirements could exist without any hint of meeting them are provided in the game itself.

It was Karn that Colt called boring. You know how some old geezers will just talk on and on about the same thing, until everyone is put to sleep. Well Colt was just giving a typical reaction as he was giving details concerning the tournement for the dragon thingie. But it&#39;s natural for him to get carried away since he&#39;s obviously an expert researcher in the feild. Scientists especially get so emotional about their favorite subjects, that they lose all track of time when they expound upon such matters. They&#39;re constantly reliving all of their favorite details and experiances even as they&#39;re talking. And, considering that there are so many fields and branches related to even just one closely studied subject, such as the rare dragon, the information accumulated so far could seem endless to some. Actually, the scientific study of any subject is endless. Karn, having lived as long as he has must&#39;ve had alot of exciting details and experiances that he wanted to relate; thinking that his captive audiance would be just as interested and entertained as he was. I don&#39;t think that it would have occurred to him, that anyone would&#39;ve considered one of his favorite subjects as less than exciting. In fact, he&#39;d probably be suprised to find out that people weren&#39;t sitting on the edge of their seats in awe of the fantastic information concerning the dragon. So in short, Colt&#39;s reaction may not have really been all that remarkable; since older people will get carried away with talking a subject to death. <FONT COLOR="119911">What really suprised me was that I couldn&#39;t transfer my &#39;Eve&#39; pixie from my slate.

 i guess all the information new trainers have at their disposal changes the view of the major 4.  when i first faced them, way back in 99, they seemed impossible at first, and it was only through repeated efforts and combining and improving, that i was able to defeat them.

 In my opinion the best surprise in the game was the Legend Cup, I knew i mr1 there was no such thing... so once I unlocked that, I was like wow, coolness. And then on top of that there was a Hall-Of-Fame.

 Two things: <BR> <BR>1: when colt says &#34;did that tree just move?&#34; I cried. Me and my friend couldn&#39;t stop laughing. It was 5:30 in the AM and I had just drank a 2-liter of Mountain Dew, soooo...... <BR> <BR>2: Joker&#39;s Mask. Hilarious. Couldn&#39;t stop laughing in church. Thats all I can say.

 The fact that Pixies, er, jiggle when they&#39;re angry was quite an interesting sight. <BR>Also, ever had a monster NOT like Colt&#39;s Birthday Song?

 the thing that surprised me the most, was when it hit Apr 1st Year 1100.  Colt talks about how we&#39;ve worked together for a century, then says we should part way and goes of screen.

 Hum... I remember When I had just gotten the Hot spring. And as master pabs or someone drops by. He Tells you about the Undine and about threw then asks to use your hot springs. I just couldn&#39;t stop laughing. <BR>It was the weirdest thing, then there was the Mock, Wacky, Jill, and Zilla events. <BR>You hav to get a Jill boot and foot print to get a Jill.

 I don&#39;t believe that. =P <BR>I was pretty surprised actually that Niton didn&#39;t have its own method of being unlocked.  Or that so many monsters required being unlocked.  I thought that it was really cool that I got to tourney against FIMBA though, and that Holly showed up.  It had been so long since I&#39;d seen her last. <BR>Actually event-wise, it startles me every time Colt asks to upgrade the house or barn.  I don&#39;t know Binto&#39;s secret yet, but when I reach 8th rank &#40;I&#39;m at 7th right now&#41; I&#39;ll be looking forward to learning it.

 After reading these forums, I realized that worms  <BR>were pretty important and sometimes rare. Well,  <BR>after introducing my sis to this game, we started  <BR>Disc Stoning. The first three discs were locked,  <BR>the fourth disc made a scaled jell which she  <BR>called &#39;Alamaloo&#39; but the fifth disc created a  <BR>blue worm!

 That&#39;s just because jells are amazing.  And Worms are in MR2- they just have to be unlocked.
