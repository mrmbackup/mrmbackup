 I&#39;d agree w/ DP...even though I haven&#39;t played MR1 a whole lot, I do like that you can buy several items at a time, and I also like that you get paid for those work drills!

 Well, my answer is biased being that I&#39;m a pure mr1 player - hengars life spans, dragons life spans, dragons stat gains, number of monsters not total number but number of different breeds, money for drills, the training display for each monster, I like that more then the full 3d view of mr2, as torey said, that lovely music, and the cool animations of them, damn butterfly!!! lol and just for torey - disks!

 Actually, Dragons are pretty much the same thing in both games, except that they looked cooler in MR1 &#40;lifespan and stats were the same, though&#41;.  Also, I definately think that MR2&#39;s attacks look a lot better than MR1&#39;s, but it was nice how most monsters had at least 2 or 3 Int-based attacks, and 2 or 3 Pow-based ones, so that you could raise one to concentrate on either &#40;In MR2, there&#39;s no point to raising an Int-based Hare&#41;.

 I&#39;m going to take the time to give my likes and dislikes &#40;since everybody knows that I never take stands agaisnt two games tha tI love dearly&#41;. <BR> <BR>MR1:  I loved the flexibility of monsters &#40;being able to train either pow or def, as Nate mentioned&#41;, the ability to feed it multiple items per week, and the way that training was less harsh, if not having an effect at all, on lifespan.  Also, the infant to adult animations were rather interesting, even though they held little significance. <BR> <BR>What I absolutely LOATHED about MR1 was the fact that my monsters would constantly get lost on expeditions unless I got up to at LEAST 700 intelligence and skill, which was MAJORLY difficult in MR1!  That takes us to the second thing...You earn FAR less stats by training in MR1, making it almost a priority to use Training as the basis of stat acquisition.  In battle, skill was the most important stat. Sure it mattered that you had pow, int, def, and lif, but the opponent was almost definitley going to put damage on you, so oyu had to be able to hit back just to win by percentages.  This reality makes speed less effective, making most lean towards defense.  Also, in MR1, attacks don&#39;t affect intelligence or power based monsters differently, making the amount of defense one has the sole means of protection, and leaving no giant gaps in a monster with high defense.  In MR2, a Golem or Naga can be slain EASILY by a few intelligence techniques.  In MR1, this isn&#39;t the case.  Monsters with 50 intelligence take the same damage from a technique as monsters with 500!  This is, of course, providing they both have the same defense quotient. <BR> <BR>I digress, though.  Despite the lack of holes in the opponent&#39;s defensive, and the ever-so-annoying monster getting lost on an expedition, MR1 is one of my favorite games of all-time. <BR> <BR>MR2:  I disliked a few things about MR2, as well.  For starters, not only had they removed certain breeds and techniques that were very useful &#40;IMHO&#41;, but they increased the aggravation by making good combos more difficult.  This really wouldn&#39;t be so bad either, except that they totally forgot to mention how to get good combos or what makes a good combo ANYWHERE in the the instruction of MR1 OR MR2, making it seem more like a hit or miss randomising more than statistics.  Also, there were a few monsters that onced raised could not be combined with anything to add a sub-type.  Creatures like Gaboos, Hoppers, and Color Pandoras, and Mews were denied a sub-type, leaving them as being left out of the big picture for the most part. Also, I disliked the Smoked Snake taking so long ot work.  In MR1, a single Mystic Snake would take the monster all the way form Gentle to Even, or maybe into the harsh zone a bit.  In MR2, however, the Smoked Snake requires three or four to switch half that distance! <BR> <BR>As far as the battling goes, I thought that the increase of stats as well as the definite strength/weakness ratio of every breed added a new dimension ot the game.  Suddenly, those that were playing MR1 beforehand revelled in the delight of getting 15pts. maximum on a light drill when the bar used to be only 8pts.  I also like how the expeditions are no longer based on days, but on the life gauge of the individual monster.

 1&#41; Same with dark phoenix, the music is better in MR1. Gives a nice soothing effect when you play.  <BR> <BR>2&#41; The controls are better in MR1. No matter how fast I tapped the directional button, it can still catch up. In MR2, it was slower. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Some monsters are nicer in MR1. I like the Nya in MR1 better. Though I feel the head is a little too large.....In fact I never remembered the Nya had such a huge head before. Not only Nya, other monsters too. <BR> <BR>4&#41; Yeah multiple gold peaches in MR1. My Velvet is 16 yrs now heheheheheheh.

 I haven&#39;t played MR1 much but what I like about it was the money for drills and the being able to buy multiples of an item at the shop.  I started off playing MR2 so I got used to the control interface while battling and like it.  I find I have a hard time adjusting when I switch to MR1.  I definately think the graphics in MR2 are far better then MR1 but that&#39;s to be expected.  From what I&#39;ve seen it was easy to max out a single or a couple of stats in MR1 where as it isn&#39;t as easy in MR2.  Getting lost on errantries sucks on MR1.  All in all I like MR2 better but my fiance likes MR1 better since she started playing that first.  All in all, I&#39;m convinced that there is some kind of hypnotic command in both games as I&#39;ve stayed up until 5 am playing, slept for 2 hours and gone to work.  Not a very rational thing to do.

 One thing I miss from MR1 is how hilariously  <BR>fat the monsters can get.  I used to feed my  <BR>hare candy over and over just for laughs, so  <BR>that it would end up nearly as wide as it is tall.   <BR>Also, the music is much better in MR1, as  <BR>others have mentioned.  Finally, as a hare  <BR>afficionado, I was disappointed by the  <BR>changes that were made to Scaler and Buster  <BR>&#40;known as Scaled Hare and Fairy Hare in  <BR>MR2&#41;.  Scaler had a dino tail and Buster had a  <BR>pixie tail, but in MR2 they were both just given  <BR>generic bunny tails.

 to make way for zuums. ;&#41; but they could&#39;ve had both. zuums appear to be faster and more agile, but not as powerful as dinos. i say that based on looks, not stats. i&#39;m not very familiar with dino stats. ^^;; i do like how some of the monstes in mr1 look vs. mr2. MR2 a lot of them look like they were just painted a different color rather than actually mixed with the breeds, as Hair Raiser pointed out. also, the names in mr2 aren&#39;t as creative as in MR1. i.e: sappire vs. fanged mask &#40;which doesn&#39;t even have fangs!!&#41; and buster vs. fairy hare. i mean, it seemes that in mr2 most of the monsters with zuum subtypes are scaled whatever, and the pixie subs are fairy something or pink something. if they had such spiffy names before, why change them?

 Yes, the animations are great, especially for Tigers.  <BR>Then again, I&#39;ve been a Tiger fan since watching the  <BR>show when it first came out. Ahh, childhood memories... <BR>Anyway, getting payed for &#34;jobs&#34; is much better than  <BR>just doing drills. I can go for several months without  <BR>going to a single tourny and still have some money in  <BR>case I don&#39;t beat it.

 I have only just gotten MR1. I must say that the thing that I like more about it compared to MR2 is Doodle. Again, I haven&#39;t gotten that far in it yet.

 I love how in MR1 everything seems more physical. Subbreeds actually could differ in something other than color from the main breed. For instance A Harehoundlooks just like Tiger except he&#39;s brown. In MR1, Rover is shorter than most Tigers, and looks more like a puppy, even when fully grown. The thing I like most is that your monsters just don&#39;t grow biggerm they change physically as well. Take Spot &#40;Dino/Hare&#41; for example. As a baby he looks just like a brown Dino. But when he&#39;s an adult, he has horns. And they don&#39;t just appear there one day, you see the stubs slowly begin to grow as the months tick by. Plus I like how your monsters actually get fat and skinny. Money for drills is cool and you can stuff your monster with item, after item, after item as much as you please, as apposed to the later games&#39; one item per week rule. That gets so annoying! I like how the breed/subreed appear in the shrine, though I don&#39;t like how you don&#39;t have the option not to keep the monster. All in all MR1 just seems more origional and has a nice feeling to it. If not for MR2&#39;s overall complexity, I would like MR1 better.

 The ranch.  IMO, the ranch looks cozier and more joyous in MR1.  I also really, really, REALLY liked how you made money from training in 1.  I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve almost gone bankrupt in MR2 due to monsters&#39; stats being...well, crap.  At least in 1, you can keep yourself afloat for a new generation...
