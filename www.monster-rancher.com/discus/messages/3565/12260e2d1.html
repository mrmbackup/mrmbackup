 In the 55-gallon aqaurium: <BR>I have four angelfish, named Meanie, The Thing, Black Eye, and Spot. I also have one of those see-through fish named Sea-Through-It, two fish that are pinkish-white with clear fins named Fish A and Fish B &#40;Fish B is overweight, which is how I tell them apart&#41;, and a bottomfeeder named Bottomdweller. <BR> <BR>In the fishbowl: <BR>A dark blue, silver-faced Betta fish named Shark.

 My sister used to have a fishbowl with a goldfish. Then it died, so she got a beta and a cleaner snail. Then the Beta died and she got another. Then the shrimp died, but she didn&#39;t know it, and the lack of clean water killed the beta. Then she got a ten gallon tank with two reject goldfish from one of those carnie games where you toss a pingpong ball into a bowl to get a fish as a prize. The first one died, and in consideration with her record, she gave the second one away. In keeping with her lack of pets, just as a note, her finch {little parakeet-like bird} had a seizure.

 I don&#39;t mind that he died.  His name explains his personality. <BR> <BR>By the way, I moved Shark in with the others, and he&#39;s doing just fine!

 Bottomdweller died...I got two new fish!  A Rubberlips named Big Mouth and a little black-and-white catfish named Whiskers.  I call them &#39;The Maintenence Men&#39; because Big Mouth eats algae &#40;ONLY algae&#41; and Whiskers eats fish food that falls to the bottom and...droppings.

 Well, my stowaway snails went at it all night last night &#40;I did not stay up to watch all of it, but assume this since they were doing it at night, and hte following morning&#41;... So I&#39;m expecting a big snail growth. The good side, free food for my baby tiger barbs. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t wait till the LFS get&#39;s my special order of Yo Yo&#39;s in...

 I just got two new angelfish &#40;they&#39;re really small&#41;.  One is black with a bit of white, named Homie &#40;My idea, I was making my mom&#39;s ideas appropriate&#41; and Baked Bean &#40;My idea.  &#39;Bean&#39; came to mind, then &#39;Baked&#39; did, somehow&#41;, who is completely that yellowish-white color with orange-yellow on top.  We&#39;re &#39;floating&#39; them right now.

 Nicole, seeing how often you&#39;ve had fish die, I suggest you do some research on the Nitrogen cycle, as well  as researching the fish you have. <BR> <BR>Some good sites to start at are fishindex.com, aquariumfish.net, and google.com.

 New fish!  I have all kinds of info on her type, but I forgot the species name!  She has special markings that only females of her type &#40;And if I remember right, she&#39;s some sort of gourami - but maybe not&#41; - a silverish color with two black spots on each side.  Her name is Neonsky.

 I had over eight guppies, and about 48 to 60 somthing fry... that is, until my lil sister got her boyfriend mad who then &#40;being the &#42;censored&#42; he is&#41; turned up the heat in my guppy tank. He thought it was hers... I finally noticed that they were all floating around upside down when I got home from hockey practice. Mmm mmm mmm, good &#39;ol fried guppy. After the death of the adults, the &#40;almost&#41; entire population of my smaller fry tank fell to about 4, and the next day to 2. <BR> <BR>While cleaning out the adult tank, I found another baby! <BR> <BR>Today I now have 3 adult guppys &#40;2 males and 1 female&#41; and 2 fry... at least for now. &#40;now i check my sister&#39;s boyfriends for signs of insanity and the like&#41;
