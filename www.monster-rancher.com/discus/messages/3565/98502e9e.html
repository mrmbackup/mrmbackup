 Lisa postsed a thread like this a while ago, and you can still see what it contained but u can not add to it. I would like to see a map of all the continents, you could go anywhere that was mentioned passively and even places you could visit on the games&#40;Galoe, Brillia&#41;. You could send messages to other players &#40;not AI!&#41;, and trade items. As for the training: You can train a monster once in a whole week, the rest of the time would be spent in the tourneys and talking to people. The game would have to be in almost-real time; which means 1 game week= 1 real day. You would have to enter the Tournament 1 day in advance and would have to be in the city at the time of the for-mentioned event. You would still have a ranch and there would be a &#34;Employment Office&#34; in each city where you could go and find work for your monster and raise it&#39;s stats at the same time. You would travel in a caravan and be able to freeze monsters. When you trainer rank goes up, so does the amount of monsters you can have.

 If that happened, they would have to add a more  <BR>complex ranking system, or at least more ranks

 Actaully, I would think taht they would just have to make it harder for people&#39;s monsters to change ranks.  Y&#39;know, make their job worth X amount of points, their purse worth Y, the amoutn fo tourneys they have won Z, etc.  However, with this, you couldn&#39;t just jump ranks by beating a tournament.  Perhaps trainers would only be invited to participate when their monster has gotten all of the prerequisites for becoming the next rank...

 It wouldnt be too hard to make it online. All you really need is an option in the start up screen to go online, then just use your Vs. data and set it up like a normal match. <BR> <BR>The only problem is Tecmo needs servers for the matches, and that might be a problem.

 Well,I believe than an online MR game would expand the userbase of the games. <BR> <BR>Since it would be online,then they can release this game for both a console and the PC,therefore allowing PC gamers to delve into the world of MR. <BR> <BR>Of course,there are problems with this...it would take a lot of cash and time to make,and server maintenance is also an issue. <BR> <BR>Overall,i&#39;d love to see an online Monster Rancher game.

Ultimately, you <B>could</B> have evey monster, continent, etc., through expansion packs, but it wouldnt really workout right now, maybe in like 3 or 4 years, probably not even that long. Also, they should have an offline version, too, sorta as a backup plan if the internet thing doesnt work out. That way it would be a lot easier for them to go back to offline games. But keep the expansion packs. :&#41;

 And there could be things like missions, where you fight monsters attacking villages and stuff like that, and you could base ranks on averages of enemy monster ranks. That would make for a pretty sweet game, if you leave ranching the same.

 To add on to the missions idea, in MR2 there were &#39;Wanted&#39; monsters who were wild in the errantries, and after succeeding in the four weeks, you may fight one.  The missions could more commonly be bounty hunting, where areas will hire you to fight the monster.  Just like how your own monster can be killed or hospitalized, you&#39;d have to hit &#39;em hard to actually kill the monster, whereas a simple KO would just make it run from the area.  A new area may then hire you, or it could return later.
