 Well, it&#39;s been a year since I threw open the doors here, and two years since B. Campbell started the board. It&#39;s been an interesting, sometimes fun, sometimes frustrating time! Thanks to everyone for helping make the site so great!

 Congrads Lisa, you deserve the most credit. Sure the rest of us nick-picked in assistance and moved some stuff, but if you hadn&#39;t made this place so well, we wouldn&#39;t have had a place to move it to. Thanks to everyone&#39;s effort after Bobby the dumb/fat/loser <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> attack. This massive archive of MR information has been preserved. Even thanks to all the people who came along after the &#39;Big Move&#39;, your contributions have assisted in making this place as large as it is. <BR> <BR>&#42;wipes a tear from his eye&#42; <BR> <BR>Thank you, each and everyone.

 &#42;chuckles&#42;  I actually remember when Wildcard and Zoniks were still around.  I remember arguing morals with Tiamat when he&#39;d joke aroudn about how to get a Moo. Every day that I spent since my first post, I&#39;ve gotten closer to everybody; old family, new family, extended family &#40;MR.com residents&#41;.  I met the love of my life here, as well as little Brother.  I just hope that this board can continue its&#39; long reign of prosperity and enlightenment that has made it so popular.  Likewise, I hope that the newcomers will continue to be friendly and see this as a second home.  <BR> <BR>A TOAST to a year of peace and a lifetime of dreams! ^_^
