 A quick report on the quest to find King Ape. Having nothing else to do for about two hours this afternoon, I started trying to hunt this sucker down. <BR> <BR> Results as follows: <BR> <BR>A-class Ghost known as Spooky. <BR> <BR>Jun. 1 <BR> <BR>Course already closed. <BR> <BR>200 re-sets to keep all other factors the same. <BR> <BR> <BR>Encounters- <BR> <BR>18 Non-encounters <BR> <BR>King Ape - 0 <BR> <BR>Wild Saurian - 55 <BR> <BR>Mad Gaboo - 55 <BR> <BR>Everything else - at least once. <BR> <BR> <BR>This leads me to three hypotheses: <BR> <BR>1. The trigger event hasn&#39;t been set. <BR>   A. It is hidden in one of the expeditions. <BR>   B. It is in the mini-game for the Pocketstation. <BR> <BR>2. Like Ghosts in MR1, King Ape is insanely hard to set off. <BR> <BR>3. King Ape was edited out of the US version for reasons unknown. <BR> <BR>If anybody has met this curosh WITHOUT using a Gameshark, would you please post and throw the rest of us &#40;me, in particular&#41; a bone, clue, hint... HELP!!!!!

 I remember a post long ago describing King Ape as being a white Ape with a red majestic coat and a scepter.  The person that found it did so by accident, and it was his girlfriend that was witness to this, as he had never seen anything like it before.  I am sorry that I have no conclusion to obtaining King Ape, and at first I thought it was as hokey as the Leviatan or Werewolf being int he game, but after the report of the cards that one did long ago, it would appear that it does exist, and is the most illusive of ALL mosnters to locate.

 Yeah, so hard to find, it&#39;s like the only DP hasn&#39;t found for his opponents list!

 I have him in my card list because of a gameshark, and he doesn&#39;t really look like a king...more of a clown crossed with Gallagher.  No scepter, no robe, just a funky-looking polka-dot shirt and overalls.

 One of my friends said he found him not long ago, I&#39;m not rightly sure if he did or didn&#39;t. He re-set when it beat the crap out of his S class Jell&#40;note: I didn&#39;t see it myself&#41;. He said Int and Life were it&#39;s highest stats. He said somewhere between 750-850 each. He couldn&#39;t remember the rest. He did say something about the banana &#40;the one that follows all apes around&#41; was a light blueish color and &#39;The King&#39; was wearing a jacket. If this is so, I&#39;d love to find him. Wonder if it gives something special. Then again, I&#39;m not going to completely trust him either.

 Update... Now running a Bad-natured Tainted Cat. Reached B - class and tried for the King. Out of 25 tries, 12 were Wild Saurian, 2 were Mad Gaboo, 6 were non-encounters and 5 were various. <BR>Based on the sheer, raw number of non-encounters, I, reluctantly, have decided that there is an event that has not been set yet. There is a large building behind a pumpkin in the upper right corner of Parepare.  <BR>Working to increase Wildcat&#39;s INT over 500 to see if there is anything in there. Last try produced 5 out of 6 bunches of Magic Bananas. AAAUUUGGGHHH!

 Weekend Update- <BR> <BR>Now an S-class Bad natured Tainted Cat, Wildcat still can NOT find the King Ape. Have tried when he was everything from Worst to Neutral.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m getting a headache.
