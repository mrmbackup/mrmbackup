<A HREF="http://www.mf-online.jp/com_blog_entry.aspx" TARGET="_top">http://www.mf-online.jp/com_blog_entry.aspx</A> <BR> <BR>How do you like that? They&#39;ve been updating consistently since  <BR>March. I guess Monster Farm Channel isn&#39;t as accurate as it used to  <BR>be now that MR development is being outsourced. <BR> <BR>Anyway, the blog entries show off a number of new breeds, as well  <BR>as the new designs of current breeds. At least six or seven new  <BR>species have been introduced. <BR> <BR>The official site has also been updated with new monsters, playable  <BR>characters and NPCs.

 Nice find, looks like Tecmo&#39;s main JP page just started pointing to it.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s still really hard to tell anything about a game until you&#39;ve played, though.

 I managed to gather at least two things from the earlier blog  <BR>entries; <BR> <BR>First, monsters&#39; physical appearances will change depending on  <BR>how they are raised, making every monster unique. &#40;Examples in  <BR>the latest blog entry &#40;Those aren&#39;t subtypes, as I suspected earlier&#41;&#41;. <BR> <BR>Secondly, according to the GM, a large number of classic breeds  <BR>will be returning in addition to the numerous new ones. When  <BR>asked if Worm or Monol would &#34;possibly&#34; be amongst them, he  <BR>answered &#34;Of course!&#34;. The key word here is &#34;possibly&#34;; he did not  <BR>confirm anything.

 New entry for today has an interview. Most of it is really hard to  <BR>figure out, but I managed to decipher the following: <BR> <BR>Once again, the monsters won&#39;t be dying. However, they&#39;ll reach  <BR>a point where they won&#39;t get any stronger. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll be training one monster at a time, but can have access to  <BR>more than one. &#40;Not 100% clear on this one, frankly&#41; <BR> <BR>There won&#39;t be any monster trading, yet online PvP battling is  <BR>pretty much certain. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll be able to create/join a party of persons with their  <BR>monsters to go on large-scale ventures, as is the status quo of  <BR>most MMOs.

 Ah, yes, I think I&#39;ve got that second one. It looks like you can raise  <BR>multiple monsters, yet can only take one with you at a time. Thus,  <BR>you won&#39;t be forced to raise several to get anywhere.

 Oh, before I forget, I found a special message on the official site. <BR> <BR>It stated that they&#39;re planning for a Spring release in Japan, along  <BR>with a number of cryptic messages, one of them hinting at a new/ <BR>alternate method of Monster regeneration.

 Recently there have been a lot of U.S. companies buying the licenses  to a lot of MMO-style games, usually developed by small Korean companies, and providing cheap servers for them. <BR>It seems to be one of the new marketing trends lately. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not saying it will happen, but there is a very small chance, I think. <BR>Although, I do not like any of these companies I&#39;m referring to. <BR>They try to squeeze every penny out of you that they can, and I said &#34;cheap&#34; servers for a reason. Sometimes the lag for certain games is unbearable and only people with extreme patience are able to play them. <BR> <BR>That said... even though I&#39;ve been a huge MR fan since #1, I won&#39;t play this game in any form, even if it were translated and even on good servers. <BR>I hate MMO&#39;s and I can&#39;t stand that they want you to keep paying for a game that you already have.

 I agree with the complete and utter dislike of makeing people pay to play a game they already paid for.  I do play one game online, and all of the servers are run by players as the company who made the game abandoned it about 3 months after it was relesed.  That company sence has gone out of buisness but there are still a core group of people who play the game.  At any given time there are at least 4 player run servers up. <BR>As far as monster rancher goes.......its a tough call.  I love the series &#40;dispite evo which I personally didn&#39;t like all that much&#41; and want to continue to suport it.  But I don&#39;t think I could afford to pay a monthly fee to play it.

 Codemaster&#39;s is the only real company I know of that grabs MMOs from countries like Korea; unfortunately most said MMOs they have released suck.  Most Korean/Asian MMOs are pretty bad because they still go by the long, horrible grinds and half-baked PvP systems &#40;Wow&#39;s PvP has flaws, but it&#39;s playable and optional&#41;.  It also doesn&#39;t help that most Asian companies tell their international customers to go &#34;F&#34; themsevles when someone gives them feedback or criticism when their games are getting hacked or rigged most of the time &#40;FFXI with gilsellers making anything at endgame impossible and painful to do, PSO/U&#39;s hacking scene, etc.&#41;.  You can&#39;t stop people from buying virtual money, but when you can&#39;t control the hacking and cheating going on...well... &#40;just try to play Rakion, where you HAVE to cheat to win&#41;. <BR> <BR>I actually like online games, and don&#39;t mind the fee because most &#91;smart&#93; companies try to improve and expand their games.  I can barely sit through a single player game because my friends and I are either too busy to get together.  At least with a PC game, you or a good fan base can mod the game to make it more fun or even fix it &#40;You might want to read this line again, Lisa, since you went nuts with your stupid, crazy lawsuit threats to most of the MR fans&#42;&#41;. <BR> <BR>If the company goes out of it&#39;s way to address its players&#39; needs while adding content &#40;Blizzard, Funcom, Anet, and Sony do this, and even Squareenix does it now and then&#41; I&#39;m willing to pay $15/month for a game because it shows they care about the product. <BR> <BR>That said, even if this comes out here, I dont&#39;expect the game to be very good at all after seeing Phantasy Star Universe, Archlord, and Rising Force Online flop like a fish.  I&#39;m tired of playing a crappy Asian MMOs only to have it ruined by hacking/cheating, and rotten players &#40;something that really killed PSU&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42;Yeah, I went there.

 The little Mocchi-like bunny is &#34;Salamander&#34;, and the new dragon is Shiguniru.  It seems the name is meant to be ironic since they have nothing to do with real or mythical salamanders - they&#39;re little arctic mammals with pink fur. There&#39;s a mention of Mocchi in Salamander&#39;s profile.  Is this the replacement for it on online?

 Most of the stuff is about game customization.  The only stuff I personally found interesting was the note about the art released so far all taking place in the northern areas of the world, implying there might be a drastic change in climate that effects monsters in other areas.
