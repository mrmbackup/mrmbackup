 1&#41;What breed do you usually pick for the role of the dummy when dmming, or using a similar raising method? <BR> <BR>2&#41;Do you try to make your dummy useful &#40;e.g. orb hunter, money maker, etc.&#41;? <BR> <BR>I usually pick Zans as my dummies b/c I like to have my dummies make some dinero for me especially when they hit S Class &#40;I love their accuracy their attacks have&#41;.  Having a capable dummy fight for cash is useful especially if you need money for dmming, or passing time until you can wake up your serious monster, but that&#39;s my two cents.  What are your ideas with dummies? <BR> <BR>Just curious to see how some mr3 gamers here use&#40;d&#41; their dummies

 I did some moneymaking at first, but then quickly gave in to simply sleeping every week. It speeds up DMMing a great deal. I usually use plants because they live the longest, so there&#39;s less fuss with getting new ones. I also make them Split in town, so I dont have bad hearts wasting space in my inventory.

1&#41; I go with almost anything for a dummy, unless i&#39;m planning out some sort of heartline. I also keep exclusively durahans as moneymakers &#39;cause of their longer lifespan and techs that are good at lvl 1 for beating the computer opponents &#40;thunder wind and stray bolts specifically&#41;. <BR> <BR>2&#41; My money maker doubles as my orb hunter, and as i said before, is a durahan. I only unfreeze this monster when i need an orb during a venture week, or on one of the Big 5 battle weeks with this monster. My dummies... well, unless i&#39;m facing a deadline &#40;or i get frustrated at DMMing&#41;, then all of them make S class and fight in the Big 5s when they can. Otherwise, as Lisa said, its <U>lot</U> easier to just have them rest every week.

 i used my dummies as moneymakers until i got up above 800,000 g&#39;s.  now i raise my dummies in lif in morx, even after they hit 999 - it seems like there are less screens to go thru, unless they get great.   <BR> <BR>and any breed can be a dummy.

 For MR2, I raise Ski, Pow/Int, &#40;based on the need of the monster&#41; and Lif up to 999 in each of the said stats. &#40;I usually choose one of the HAD monsters for this&#41; Then, I only fight on the M4 battles I miss while I&#39;m doing the said method with the &#39;4th week monster&#39;. <BR> <BR>For MR3 however, I&#39;ve actually devised somewhat of a method for tech acquisition that utilizes the &#39;dummy monsters&#39; used while DMM&#39;ing. The idea here is that I&#39;ll DMM the monster until it has all of the desired techs maxxed, as well as all stats, sans two. &#40;This varies for me&#41; These stats I&#39;ll leave somewhere between 800-899. &#40;The monster used for DMM&#39;ing here isn&#39;t given a Monster Heart, and it&#39;s chars are carefully culled, for reasons explained below.&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, here&#39;s my char gaining method, for those that care to read it.  <BR> <BR>1. I first start out with a Suezo, if the DMM monster dosen&#39;t already have &#34;Sharp Eyes&#34;. &#40;Otherwise, I&#39;ll go with a Hare, for it&#39;s &#34;Fast Footwork&#34; char&#41; Once I&#39;ve got the intended &#39;victim&#39; on the ranch, I try to kill it as fast as possible, while keeping things like &#34;Easily Tired&#34;, and other undesireable chars in check whenever I can. &#40;This can cost some money, but I generally have a couple of money makers in my freezer to cover the loss.&#41; <BR> <BR>2. Once I&#39;ve killed off the dummy, &#40;&#39;char culling&#39;&#41; I&#39;ll pass it&#39;s Heart on to another monster with another desired char&#40;s&#41;. I keep in mind the types of chars that will and won&#39;t work on the final recipent of this sacrafical Heart, the DMM monster, and I work accordingly. <BR> <BR>3. Once I&#39;ve got all the chars I need, I pass the said &#39;dummy Heart&#39; on to a monster that can gain well in the stats on the DMM monster that I leave in the 800-899 range. Then, as the final step in this method, I work the said stats up to 999, while trying not to have anything drop below the normal values of the unworked stats on the dummy monster. Then, I finally give the &#39;dummy heart&#39; on to the DMM monster, and voila! An all 999 monster, with carefully selected chars to optimize it&#39;s performance. &#40;This can take more time than neccesary to DMM a monster, not to mention you may have to polish it&#39;s stats a bit, but I&#39;ve found this to be well worth it.&#41;

 I use my dummies for one of three things: <BR> <BR>1- Just passing time, with a Plant usually resting every week <BR>2- Expanding my encyclopedia by evolution &#40;most recent examples include Baku &#62; Baksheesh, Tortboy &#62; Mewkiri, and Zan &#62; Gui&#41; <BR>3- Moneymaking, and for this I use a Petraden with a maxed out Atomic Fist that passes through every generation
