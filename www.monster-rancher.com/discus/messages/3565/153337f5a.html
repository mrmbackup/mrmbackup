 Does anyone know of a place taking pre-orders on this title? I really want to show my support for the franchise, but the only places I see it popping up on are a couple non-descript sites that I don&#39;t exactly trust.

 Gamestop doesn&#39;t have it in their computer yet. If it&#39;s possible for you to drop by one of their stores &#40;GameStop, Babbage&#39;s, Software Etc., E.B. Games, Electronics Boutique&#41; please talk to the staff and ask about the game. They are supposed to file a report, they have the ability to do it daily, to let the buyers know what people are asking about. If you ask, hopefully, word will get to the higher-ups.

 Though it is possible to file the report having formerly worked for the company it&#39;s not to often they do.  But I&#39;m also surprised they do not have a pre-order sku for it yet.  I would just pester them about it personally. =p

 I have been doing that during my weekly stops to my local gamestops, Bayonetta and Darksiders are both great btw. But saddly it is still not in their databases. <BR> <BR>I have peeked a few peoples interest through my website and would love to link to a proper spot where they could order. I&#39;ll keep searching day by day to see what I can find.

 you guys really dont have the pre order availability in the states? One thing for SURE is that the 3 gamestops in Toronto have had the SKU since confirmation of the game. Use that as leverage.

 Subster, would you happen to have the receipt from your pre order?  It&#39;s possible that even with the sku they can &#34;force&#34; the pre order.  As long as there is a sku for the game even if it isn&#39;t on the &#34;pre order&#34; list they can pre order it.  That is assuming you did in fact pre order it from the gamestop in Canada.

 I work at Gamestop here in Toronto so I checked system immediately this game was announced. The receipt I don&#39;t have as every single game I pre order I don&#39;t need since I work there, earliest I&#39;m working there is this Sunday, I&#39;ll write the SKU down on Sunday.

 I got the SKU today it&#39;s 6190177. It&#39;s SKU for MR2 DS for Canadian Gamestops if it&#39;s worth anything to you guys.

I just checked Amazon this morning. They have a listing for a Monster Rancher on the DS made by Tecmo Koei.  <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Monster-Rancher-Nintendo-DS/dp/B00320JDW6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1264699340&amp;sr=8-2" TARGET="_top">http://www.amazon.com/Monster-Rancher-Nintendo-DS/dp/B00320JDW6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1264699340&amp;sr=8-2</A> <BR> <BR>There still isn&#39;t a picture but it is listed! <BR> <BR>They say the release date is March 30th. <BR> <BR>If this does not get to gamestop soon then I will be ordering here along with overnight delivery.

 I would not recomend amazon.com as a reliable source for pre-ordering. I tried pre-ordering MR 4 from them, and a week after I could buy the thing in any store, they still had not shipped out my copy. Just my experience. Pre-ordering games on amazon has not met my satisfaction.

 That&#39;s odd, most people I have read about have gotten a lot of games a day or two before street date by ordering from Amazon.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still going to wait a little while to see if gamestop opens up their US preorder. Maybe I&#39;ll send them this link to show that people are ahead of them.

 Amazon&#39;s game fulfillment is via Toys R Us&#39;s outdated trucking system and quite plainly stinks. The games get shipped from the factory to the TRU warehouse in New Jersey. They then get loaded onto semi-trucks and head to various stores and Amazon&#39;s warehouse in the Northwest. They arrive at least 6 days later, then get processed and shelved. <BR> <BR>Now, if you buy from an Amazon Marketplace seller, that&#39;s a whole different story. Know the difference.

 Hmm I guess it would make a difference depending on how early before street date the game was shipped out. Since a lot of major titles get shipped out a week ahead of time, or more, then they can likely take care of that process beforehand. Kind of doubt that would be the case with this game though. But just was trying to help. :P

 True, but it sounded like they were just going to call it MRDS here and leave the 2 out completely, probably because they never ported the first. I really can&#39;t wait for this game!

 It&#39;s Monster Rancher DS, but a port of Monster Rancher Farm 2. It&#39;s kinda like what Square did with the Final Fantasy games where they just skipped a lot of them and gave the later ones earlier numbers for continuity&#39;s sake.

 I just want to point out that IGN has it posted that the MRDS release is April 1st, which leaves me with suspicions...

Hmm+I+guess+it+would+make+a+difference+depending+on+how+early+before+street+date+the+game+was+shipped+out%2e+Since+a+lot+of+major+titles+get+shipped+out+a+week+ahead+of+time%2c+or+more%2c+then+they+can+likely+take+care+of+that+process+beforehand%2e+Kind+of+doubt+that+would+be+the+case+with+this+game+though%2e+But+just+was+trying+to+help%2e+%3aP

<!-/Source: 95758-!>
<!-Source: 95761-!>
It+IS+MR2+DS%2e+The+first+was+not+released+stateside%2e+This+one+has+been+out+in+Japan+for+some+time+already+as+well%2c+but+they+are+just+now+porting+it+over+to+us%2e
<!-/Source: 95761-!>
<!-Source: 95762-!>
True%2c+but+it+sounded+like+they+were+just+going+to+call+it+MRDS+here+and+leave+the+2+out+completely%2c+probably+because+they+never+ported+the+first%2e+I+really+can%27t+wait+for+this+game%21
<!-/Source: 95762-!>
<!-Source: 95763-!>
It%27s+Monster+Rancher+DS%2c+but+a+port+of+Monster+Rancher+Farm+2%2e+It%27s+kinda+like+what+Square+did+with+the+Final+Fantasy+games+where+they+just+skipped+a+lot+of+them+and+gave+the+later+ones+earlier+numbers+for+continuity%27s+sake%2e

exactly%2e+the+2+was+probably+just+somebody%27s+goof%2e
<!-/Source: 95764-!>
<!-Source: 95838-!>
I+just+want+to+point+out+that+IGN+has+it+posted+that+the+MRDS+release+is+April+1st%2c+which+leaves+me+with+suspicions%2e%2e%2e
