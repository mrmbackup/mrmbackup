Gamespot has posted an interesting story &#40;<A HREF="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/02/09/news_6118220.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/02/09/news_6118220.html</A>&#41; of Tecmo opening a lawsuit in the U.S. to crack down on hacking of their games. <BR>  <BR>&#40;Also it was dated around feb 2005 but I didnt see any articles about it here so thought I&#39;d bring it up ^^;; &#41; <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s part of the story: <BR> <BR>Filed in the US District Court, Northern District of Illinois, on January 25, the lawsuit names Mike Greiling and Will Glynn as &#34;creating, hosting and contributing content to a forum created to foster and facilitate the knowing infringement of Tecmo&#39;s proprietary software for its video game titles.&#34; The lawsuit claims the pair trafficked in technology designed for the purpose of circumventing copyright protection systems built into the games, which violates the US Copyright Act, among other laws.  <BR> <BR>The complaint also addresses violations that include &#34;various modifications to the source code for Tecmo games&#34; including the creation of &#34;several skins…designed to make Tecmo Characters appear naked.&#34; Games the alleged hackers are accused of applying their energy toward include Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive 3, Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, and Dead or Alive Ultimate. <BR> <BR>~~~ <BR> <BR>Just curious what everyone&#39;s thoughts are on the subject? &#40;I personally think tecmo has every right to sue ^^;; &#41;

 People take Dead or Alive as a serious fighting game?  That&#39;s saying you watch X-rated movies for a storyline, isn&#39;t it?

If they&#39;re gonna bust the hackers, then they might as well bust down on the Japanese who have been making adult comics containing their characters &#40;yes, they exist; no, don&#39;t ask me about them&#41;.  I think this lawsuit is silly, but that&#39;s just me since I pretty much hate everything about DOA &#40;stupid anime elements, laughable story and characters, etc.&#41; <BR> <BR><I>Dead or Alive being a popular game for guys is like women&#39;s swimsuit magazines being popular for guys &#62;_&#62;</I> <BR> <BR>This isn&#39;t working for me for some reason.

 &#34;The claim lists six counts or instances of violation, including direct copyright infringement, contributory copyright infringement, circumvention of copyright protection systems and trafficking in circumvention technology, violation of the Uniform Unfair Trade Practices Act, and common law unfair competition. Tecmo is seeking a jury trial.&#34;

<I>Actually,those are but web comics,and they are legal.Their as legal as flash animations,as long as the company gets a cut of the profits</I> <BR> <BR>No, they&#39;re actually adult comics in Japan where the company is not making any cash off of them &#40;Somebody scanned them, and millions of other adult sites just post them on&#41;.  They&#39;ve been pretty infamous until companies stopped caring &#40;Japan&#39;s known for copyright Hell if I remember correctly&#41;.  I don&#39;t think most companies want people to know about x-rated comics based on their games, but that&#39;s just my two cents.

 While bringing suit against hackers may be costly and impractical in some ways, agressive litigation may be one of the few existing avenues to combat &#34;blatant&#34; intellectual property violation.  <BR> <BR>In part the question hinges on whether the product/property loses value because of the violation. User mods that allow the violation of certain &#34;norms&#34; will definitely cause damage in certain markets, particularly where conservative values hold &#34;sway&#34;-look at the GTA brouhaha.  <BR> <BR>As for suing in Japan, there might not be any incentive given the &#34;acceptability&#34; of hentai there, further the comics while violative might not damage the value of the product. It might even act as free advertising to a certain degree. Also many companies do not have the resources to pursue foreign litigation.

Might what the hackers are doing fall under the &#39;criticism and parody&#39; exception of the copyright laws? <BR> <BR>Only reason I suggest this I clicked on the copyright &#40;c&#41; link on the bottom of the main MRM page today and read the page it was linked to,  <BR>10 Big Myths about copyright laws. <BR><A HREF="http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html</A>

 @Jovial_Evil <BR> <BR>Actually its the &#34;Fair Use&#34; exception, but again as the page points out, its a subjective standard- Fair use in the US isnt necesarily interpreted the same way in Japan. The commercial intent also has to be considered as well as &#34;damage&#34; to the product/property, among other factors applied by courts. <BR> <BR>Also I doubt &#34;obscenity&#34; can be interpreted as fair use. Further &#34;tampering&#34; with the software code is ultimately the real breach here not so much the &#34;lewd&#34; portrayal.
