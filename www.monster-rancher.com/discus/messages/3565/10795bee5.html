Just for fun, I thought I&#39;d see how many people here like, and manage to have, real pets.  <BR> <BR>I have a cat that I found with a broken foot, almost dead from starvation at a Toys R Us store. She lives indoors exclusively now. <BR> <BR>In the past I have raised exotic goldfish &#40;large rare ones&#41;, and birds, all of whom were adopted as unwanted and given to kind homes when I left Santa Fe to marry my husband. As a kid, after my parents moved out to the country, we had dogs, cats, goldfish, ducks plus a variety of wild visitors including bears, deer, turkeys, and snakes.

 I have tropical fish&#40;2 tanks worth&#41; and two dogs. The dogs and one tank worth are family pets, while the other tank is mine alone. It&#39;s only 10 gallons, but I plan to upgrade eventually.

 I have a cat which I found sick and abandoned out in my front yard.  It had a respiratory infection &#40;aka, &#39;a cold&#39;&#41; and an eye infection.  Both curable.  I don&#39;t know who left it out to die, but they need to be shot in the hands and feet and left outside for a week.  Let&#39;s see them treat a little kitten like that again.   <BR> <BR>Anyway, she&#39;s a little grey kitten &#40;well, a cat now.  We&#39;ve had her for a while.&#41;  She&#39;s very adorable and very weird.  She attacks plastic bags and then crawls into them and curls up to pounce on us as we walk by.  She follows us around the house attacking our feet when she gets a chance and then dashing away to hide again.  We named her Shadow Chaser because of this odd behavior... we didn&#39;t know about her facsination with bags until after we had named her though ... =&#41; <BR> <BR>Trousle

 Right now my family and myself have a dog. A tea-cup poodle rescue, Casper. He&#39;s like 4 lbs! We have a cat, Thomas. He&#39;s Satan&#39;s cat, but is getting softer in his old age. My little sister has a guinea pig, Melvin. By little bro has a mouse, Squeakers and a tarantula, Harry. Finally, I have an albino hedgehog named Lexi. I&#39;ve always wished for Tecmo to make a hedgehog monster. Oh well.

 Two dogs. Kasumi, a Golden Lab/Chow mix, which means she is about as bright as a brick and nearly as stubborn as I am &#40;and an escape artist par excellence&#41; and Honey, a Border Collie/something mix without the long hair, who is indeed a honey and just lives for the times I come out the door to pet her. Both kind and friendly as the day is long, so long as I am home. From reports I get from family, you do not want to enter my yard when I am not home...

 I&#39;ve got a white rat named Emma who is very cuddly and extremely intelligent &#40;we leave the top of her cage open most of the time, and she knows not to go wandering or make a mess&#41;.  For a lot longer, though, I&#39;ve had a black-and-grey cat named Holly and a black-and-white cat named Sam.  Holly is pretty normal as far as cats go, while Sam has the brain of a dog-- he&#39;s affectionate, clumsy, plays fetch, drinks out of the toilet on occassion, listens to commands, and is all in all much like a dog except &#40;generally&#41; self-cleaning and able to purr.

 Wow! I always wanted a hedgehog, but my family wants &#39;normal pets&#39; -_- Anyhoo, I have a guinea pig named Ray &#40;Raymond, actually, but I call him Ray.&#41;, and an old blind guinea pig named Avery. Ray is from a no-kill shelter, and Avery is from my mom&#39;s friend, who is amazed he still lives. I have a bunny, but... she actually leans outside of her cage like a baby bird to urinate! O_o Very hard to clean up after. My favourite pet of all time, is Sunny. I got her from a pound in Toronto. She looked very unattractive to everybody but me, because she was poop-rolled-in and was trying to pull everybody into the cage with her. Mom and Dad don&#39;t like her at all, but I love her! She&#39;s big and black and friendly and it&#39;s fun to romp around in the snow with her. But apparently they don&#39;t like her because she&#39;s &#39;stupid&#39; :&#124; Why do they care? I&#39;m the one who cleans up the kitchen when Dad didn&#39;t let her out while I was upstairs... Heh, I didn&#39;t mean to go on that long, but you got me started on Sunny! ^.^

 I have a dog, Mia, and a cat, Skittles. Skittles was given to us after my aunt&#39;s cat had kittens - twice. She&#39;s quite mad, also attacks and jumps into plastic bags, lets you rub her for about 15 seconds and then attacks your fingers, and doesn&#39;t like Mia at all.  <BR> <BR>Mia is a Wexford Terrier that we got from a shelter cause her owner couldn&#39;t look after her anymore. She&#39;s playful, caring and just about everything that anyone could want in a dog. She does, however, have an annoying habit of hogging my bed and then giving you a big guilty look when you try and move her. Shes usually quite wary of Skittles &#40;unless she&#39;s outside, whereupon she tears after her quite happily&#41;.

 Oops:P Forgot to say that! Yes, she&#39;s a dog, and I wanted to name her either Shadow, Bullet, or Tornado... But mom insisted we call her Sunny for her &#39;sunny disposition&#39;... Personally, I regret agreeing to that! lol

 Right now I have a cat, a Budgie, and 3 spiders &#40;2 camel-back spiders and 1 blackwidow&#41;. <BR> <BR>My cat&#39;s name is Mathias and when I got him, he was so small and such a little runt he could easily fit in just the palm of your hand. Now he&#39;s around 16 or 17 pounds, and of course is quite the giant. He was very sick when I got him and I had to nurse him back to health. He needed to be kept warm at night so I let him sleep with me, but even though he would make it to the litter to go to the washroom, the poo would get stuck to his bum and he would drag it back into the bed with me.... :/ Oh well. I used to own lots of mice so I&#39;m used to getting pooed on. <BR> <BR>Our other cat Shade&#40;my brother&#39;s&#41;, was in bad shape when we got her. She had been bitten by a large dog and her side had been badly infected, and the top layer of her skin, including the fur came off around the whole bite area. Now she has a large bald scar on her side, but she is such a sweety, who cares what she looks like. <BR> <BR>My Dad says it&#39;s very likely we saved both our cats lives. <BR> <BR>Oh yeah I almost forgot. I also have a pigeon. She was wild but was hurt somehow and now one of her wings doesn&#39;t work anymore, so we take care of her. <BR> <BR>Well that&#39;s it, as you can see, we love the hard luck cases.

 I have a crimson red Betta Splendis&#40;siamese fighting fish&#41;named Tolstoy here in my dorm room. He turned 2&#40;months&#41; today. I have eventual plans to get a 30-55 gallon planted tropical fish tank, but I haven&#39;t figured a way to fit that in my dorm room without murdering my roommate. So probably when I get a place of my own, but for now, Tolstoy is enough. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t see myself ever owning more pets than just fish, as I&#39;m fascinated by fish and aquatic life in general. Maybe I just don&#39;t like cleaning up the larger messes made by larger animals. Past pets have included 2 turtles and a frog.

 Yeah, mine does that whenever you put your hand in her cage. She&#39;s pretty sweet, though. She&#39;ll crawl up you, sit on your sholder, start snorting in your ear, and fall asleep. It&#39;s an odd feeling.

 Wow - I didn&#39;t know that ppl keep hedgehogs as pets..if we kept one either it or the cat would die, it would end up as a daily battle between the two. I remember that we found a sick one in our garden once and we tried to make it better &#40;being the experts and all&#41; but then it died. I was pretty upset about that &#40;I was about 7&#41;.

 I had a hedgehog 2 years ago... She wasalmost albino, but she had brown spikes on the tips... I also have 3 cats, previously five, but 2 got trucked. A sheepdog I had, who got a dose of old age, 14 years, to be exact. And I now have a dog who is more of a lump than an animal.

 I&#39;ve presently got four dogs &#40;I love living on a farm&#41; and one chinchilla. I keep wheedling the SO about getting a rat since my old one died, but we need more space. <BR> <BR>The dogs are Kayley &#40;a half American Eskimo dog who was adopted from a friend&#41;, Jackie &#40;a Jack Russel Terrier who was a stray rescue&#41;, Marla &#40;a part-terrier who was also a stray rescue&#41;, and Blackthorne &#40;a black something-or-other-bird-dog who&#39;s a temporary here, until we can find someone wanting to adopt&#41;. The chinchilla is Chi-chi.

 I have 2 dogs. An older beagle who is Queen of all she surveys and takes down any dog who crosses her, even pit bulls. I also have a 2 year old black lab who is far far smarter than any dog should be. Once I was tossing a ball in the house and it got stuck in the base of the computer chair just out of reach, so he grabs his bone and uses it to nudge the ball out of the tight spot!!!!  <BR> <BR>I have no cats, but I pick up all strays and sick ones to feed my dogs. Just about every culture on the planet, living and dead, has a problem with cats in their mythology and with good reason!!!!

 I don&#39;t have any pets right now. &#40;unless you count a Poinsettia&#41; I used to have a really nice Philodendron, but I had to give it away when I moved. It was big and pretty, and I was really sad to have to give it away. :&#39;&#40; As for Animals, Um I used to have some gerbils that kept making more of themselves. Fortunately they only did that 2 or 3 at a time. My favorite pet was this cat we had named &#34;Quik-Sak&#34; after the gas station were we found her. She had this annoying habit of hopping up on people while they were sleeping, and bringing lizards and such-like things home. Quik-Sak was a pretty big-cat too. It&#39;d wake you up having her land on your chest in the night.

I have one bottomfeeder named Botttomdweller, one of those see-through fish &#40;He has no name&#41; and two fish with pinkish-white bodies and see-through fins, named Fish A and Fish B &#40;I can tell them apart because Fish B is overweight&#41;.

 My cat always likes to bring a half dead bird almost everyday to show that he loves me. &#40;I think...&#41;

 We once had a cat that had seven &#40;7&#41; toes on the front feet. She also had really curly hair, like the kind that teacup poodles have. She was stolen, though. I also had a cat the killed mice and stuff. She was really wierd. She was the sweetest cat ever, and that&#39;s saying alot for a cat, but a ferocious hunter. She could kill just about anything she could catch, and that was just about anything. She once caught a foot and a hlaf long rat, and she wasn&#39;t even one yet. Sadly, we had to put her to sleep at the young age of 5 because she caught feline luekemia.

 I have a Black cat that we got from the pound, his name is Danny Boy, and he is the most affectionate cat I&#39;ve ever had.  He&#39;ll grab your finger and try to pull your hand to him, so it can pet him... it&#39;s so funny- annoying sometimes, but cute.  I can&#39;t believe someone let him get away, he&#39;s the sweetest thing in the world.

 I have two cats: Snowy and Radiator. Snowy is a male white and gold Siamese cat, he hides a lot but when he is not hiding he has a friendly disposition. Radiator is a male American Longhair and is white and orange. He is always following me around and sometimes he bites and scratches but he is VERY friendly to people he&#39;s never seen before. I got Snowy from my cousin who has about 10 different animals and couldn&#39;t stand getting another, but she liked Snowy so much she wanted him to be in the family. I got Radiator from an animal shelter and when I went to get him the manager of the animal shelter told me that his name is Radiator because he was found in one.

 I currently have a Miniature Pincher called Rex. He is very small and is quite active. Actually, scratch that, He is very lazy. All he does is lay down and chew his raw hide pig ears that we buy. He is a male of 3 yrs. He is a dog thats all bark but no bite. Literally. He gets a little too close to some of my friends. I&#39;m not kidding. I got him when he was 6 weeks old. He was the tiniest of his mother&#39;s litter. Thats one of the reasons why we got him.

 I curently have two cats Kävik and Nekko. Kävik is Inuit for wolverine and he was very aggressive as a kitten and Nekko means cat in japanese&#40;the accual spelling of the word is neko but I spell his name with 2 &#34;k&#34;s&#41;because I have always have a cat named cat in a different language&#40;one of my past cats was named Koshka which is cat in Russian&#41;. I got Nekko for free because I had discovered him in the kitten area of petsmart when I was 6 and I made my mom drive me to the store everyday after that so I could visit him. I even named him while he was still in the store, but since my mom was in the middle of switching jobs we could not afford to get him. After a few weeks of visiting him every day the store manager decided to give him to us for free as  long as we paid for his shots. This just goes to show you that when it comes to cute little kittens people become alot kinder because cats are just that awesome! But throughout my life I have had 7 cats even though I am only 15, and my earliest memorys are of playing with my 4 cats when I was 3&#40;Koshka being one of them&#41;. Sorry for the long post i just love my kittys :&#41;
