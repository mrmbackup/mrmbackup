 I know that to people who weren&#39;t members of MRM in 2001 it may seem odd to have a 9/11 thread here. But, many of the site&#39;s members spent hours that day, and over the following days, in our chatroom. <BR> <BR>We checked up on each other, shared our fears and grief, and spread news to friends who were isolated due to telephone outages. <BR> <BR>One member, whose apartment was less than a block away from the towers, and faced them, told us details of events as they happened. -Things you don&#39;t see on the fairly distant, edited and sanitized footage shown on the news. <BR> <BR>Others gave us international perspective. <BR> <BR>I think we all needed support, reassurance, and hope on that day. And, in some small measure we all found those things here. Thanks for being there, all of you.

 Speaking of long-term activity, is there any way to know when I started using the place?  I don&#39;t think it was back in 2001 but I know I&#39;ve been using the forums often and on for a long time now.

 Sorry, no. The software doesn&#39;t keep a creation date for accounts. The only way to know would be if you kept the email we sent from your account creation.

 Wow. That close? I&#39;d be scared to even be in that building. <BR> <BR>Me, I was in an airport, my plane having just landed from a cross country trip when it happened. Unlike the planes that were taken that were headed to the west coast, mine was coming from the west coast. <BR> <BR>I can imagine what a shadow of what that would be like to be in those buildings, but only a shadow and that&#39;s scary enough. Just hope they are all resting in peace.

 It was a very emotional, stressful day. Far more engaging than the news coverage, which was pretty incredible in and of itself. We shared some pretty raw emotions and experiences. It was unique, to say the least. <BR> <BR>I had an appointment in downtown Phoenix that morning and the area I needed to visit had been evacuated due to a separate bomb scare. It was very eerie walking around tall buildings and city streets with no cars on the streets and no people except armed national guard patrols -kind of like a post-apocalyptic movie. The cool part was that I got in and out quickly, and there was plenty of parking right out front. <BR> <BR>Then, I went back home and returned to chat for the rest of the day. What no one talks about now is, we weren&#39;t sure it was over. There was a huge sense of dread that more bad things were about to happen.

 That day, I was only two years old, playing with my LEGOs.  My mom was sitting by the TV, bawling.  I remember getting my other mom coming home, because everybody &#40;EVERYBODY&#41; had pulled their kids from school out of fear.  I didn&#39;t understand.  I don&#39;t remember it all too clearly, but something that big is something that&#39;s forever engraved in the back of your head.  My parents have told me that I was flying planes into my LEGOs, so my mom told me to put them away.  I regret not being old enough to understand. <BR> <BR>And even as I post this two months late, my heart aches at the thought of all the victims of the tragedy.  R.I.P. 9/11 victims.  You will never /NEVER/ be forgetten.

 Toy planes, to be clear.  When I just read that it sounded weird.
