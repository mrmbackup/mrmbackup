 just thought i might start this one. <BR> <BR>Monster rancher as a series has been a big breakthough in gaming, replay value is excellent, the PLAYER MATTERS in the game &#40;training techniques, etc&#41;, the monsters are definitely a good peice of codewriting &#40;my opinion at least&#41;. <BR> <BR>but what could make the Monster Rancher series even better? <BR> <BR>how about : <BR> <BR>1.&#41; a Tekken style fighting engine for the mosters? get the player really involved, not just depend on dice rolls and lady luck for fighting and landing that precious air shot.  i wouldnt mind if they sold the game for an extra 50$ for this one. <BR> <BR>2.&#41; raise multiple monsters and have monsters TEAM UP with each other?   <BR>&#40;imagine your Gali and your Pixie doing a Giga Ray and linghting while that Durahan picks off the bits with million stabs and air shot? kinda like &#34;team techs&#34; from Chrono Trigger?&#41; <BR> <BR>3.&#41; having the monster statistics of stress fatigue actually show up metered? so that we could get an objective perspective of raising a monster. <BR> <BR>4.&#41; Cigarettes, Tabbacco and Blood!  it&#39;d be funny to see a mochi drunk as hell too. <BR> <BR>thats it for here. <BR> <BR>hmm, how abt a soap opera between Colt and Holly and a Suezo in this weird love triangle? <BR>naaah.

 Uh, I&#39;ve got some disagreements: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Tekken is cool, but this fighting style is  <BR>unique. I dunno whats wrong with it. <BR> <BR>2&#41;The game would be too easy. <BR> <BR>3&#41;Agreed.  But how about stress going up  <BR>faster to make it more challanging? <BR> <BR>4&#41;Um, no. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure others would agree with everything,  <BR>its just that we have different tastes.  Some  <BR>pretty nice ideas there, tho.

 1&#41; I can&#39;t play fighting games. It hurts &#40;not just a little&#41; to use my right thumb on the controller because of an old muscle injury. So I couldn&#39;t play MR3 <BR> <BR>2&#41;I like to raise monsters one at a time. <BR> <BR>3&#41; It would be way too easy. That&#39;s what I like about the game. You have to know your monster to raise it well. Otherwise, a newbie would be as good as an experience player. <BR> <BR>4&#41; No.

 about my last post : <BR> <BR>regarding suggestion 2 : team techs for monsters. <BR>replies : &#34;the game would be too easy&#34; <BR> <BR>.....whoa!, i think it&#39;d be more challenging.  this aspect implies that you&#39;d have to raise multiple monsters on the ranch, have them train together, go on errantries together, theyd have to master each technique after a mess off prerequisites, <BR> <BR>thats : <BR>1. double the load of cash, <BR> <BR>2. training methods would have to be added, more diverse if you will &#40;ie, scolding a good monster while the other one screwed up on a tech.&#41; <BR> <BR>3. twice the challenge, since youd have to deal with at least two more monsters at once.  not to mention breaking a tech with multiple factors <BR> <BR>but again, you wouldnt have to raise two monsters at a time, you could just ranch them one at a time, then have them train in teams in later stages, <BR> <BR>i mean, if you had an incredible durahan in the freezer, wouldnt it be nice to have to collect and save these guys to team up later? instead of having to use them as breeding bait? <BR> <BR>again, this would be an added feature in a game, for those who like to raise multiple monsters. <BR> <BR> <BR>regarding suggestion 1 : Different fighting engine. <BR> <BR>replies : &#34;this fighting style is unique, i dunno whats wrong with it.&#34; <BR> <BR>here&#39;s whats wrong with it. <BR> <BR>if an attack has a statiscal value of 85 percent, <BR>then it should land 85 out of a hundred times, not  when the game engine &#34;feels like landing it&#34; <BR> <BR>if an attack has 5 % as a value, it should land like a lottery win, not everytime you reload and try over! <BR> <BR>how many people have been frustrated with the low skilled lucky gaboo&#39;s? ordorf and the ever punchable oakleyman?  and at the same time, that 85% to hit air shot mystically gets a miss? <BR> <BR>die rolls belong to AD&amp;D, and this game hardly belongs in that category.

 The two monsters at the same time is no  <BR>problem.  You can have a Durahan and a  <BR>Phoenix on your ranch, you&#39;re facing an  <BR>opponant, and you CANT lose. <BR> <BR>2&#41;The eighty five percent says that out of one  <BR>hundred tries, it will miss fifteen tries.  The five  <BR>percent has never happened two me, but its  <BR>still just that...five percent!  So it WILL hit five  <BR>times...which means its like a slot machine.   <BR>I&#39;ve run out of words to say, but I think you get  <BR>my point.  Thats my story and I&#39;m sticking to it.

 Actually, Tobacco WAS in the Japanese version for MR2.  Katos in particular had a liking for it.  Heck, it even shows up in the American version if you gameshark for it.  As for the cigarettes themselves...hell?  Raise a Kato?  Thank you.

 Plus, Katos LOVE to drink.....  ummmm...  Olive oil.  Yeah, that&#39;s it.  That&#39;s Olive Oil they&#39;re drinking.  Sure. <BR> <BR>Ah, gotta love them substance-abusing kittys.

 hmmm... actually, i rekkon that it&#39;d be coool if you could have 3 or even 4-way mixes in monsters. <BR>imagine the possibilites! like a noblesarion with dragon wings, all in that gali-style white-with-gold-plates..... <BR> <BR>hmmmm........ <BR> <BR>it&#39;d be nice if you could choose which parts of which monster goes where also, but that would make it easy to get a killer monster... which would be less challenging <BR> <BR>but however they decide to do it, tecmo will probably deliver monster rancher 3 with even more monsters and items, even more quests and mini-games, and the like, so im not worried. <BR> <BR>&#40;ps- on the drugs thing, that WOULD be funny to see a weed-addicted mocchi lol&#41;
