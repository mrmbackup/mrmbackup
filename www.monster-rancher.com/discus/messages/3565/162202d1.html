 Just curious to see if anyone out there also owned any virtual pets like tamagatchi, furby, or the computer sort like fin-fin...

 Two out of three. I do have a Furby &#40;though it needs some repairwork or replacement, after getting moist&#41;. I also own a Tamagochi, though it&#39;s long since disappeared somewhere into the house. One day, I&#39;ll find it again! <BR> <BR>I also have Pocketstation, and some of the games that it plays &#40;or sub-games, as the case may be&#41; are very virtual pet-like.

 I&#39;ve got a Poo-Chi right now, but it&#39;s pretty disappointing. I adopted an abused Furby for a few months, but gave it to a needy household. I am interested in getting one of the Yoda Interactives that&#39;s supposed to be shipping in July. The Gamestop has a description; it looks like it&#39;s a lot more &#39;interactive&#39; than some pets. On the PC side of things, I&#39;ve seen Fin&#39;Fin, Creatures and the Catz/Dogz/Oddballz series. Perhaps the weirdest there was one &#40;from the creators of Catz&#41; called Babyz. Lots of little babies running around, very strange, I played it at a trade show last year.

 I had a neopet.  His name was Drackenfire, a fire Shoyru.  God, did I love that thing.  Until, they removed my prized amusement park, &#34;Drackenfire Gardens&#34; with the enormous &#34;Drackenfire&#34; rollercoaster.  There goes my savings.  I&#39;m trying to catch back up, but its getting tiresome.  Maybe someday I&#39;ll win the Neo Lottery and want to play again... <BR> <BR>Nick Papageorge <BR>&#40;Baliroller Trainer&#41;

 I didn&#39;t notice this thread until now...and i can&#39;t help but laugh when i think of those tamagachi things. Mainly because my sister has/had literally like 30 of the things, and none of them work. When she got tired of one she would go out and get another, simply abandoning her previous one.  <BR> <BR>As for me, i had one like 5 years ago, but i found it boring, and i hated the noise it made. I gave it to my sister, and it undoubtedly is abandoned under a pile of clothes in her room. <BR> <BR>Perhaps there should be electronic tamagachi shelters for stray and abandoned electronic pets...

 I used to collect keychain pets.  That&#39;s kind of how I got into MR.  I don&#39;t really play with them anymore, but recently I found that my pet rabbits had gotten into my old collection and eaten all the buttons off them.  &#40;That&#39;s something rabbits do -- they like rubber buttons, like the kinds on remote controls -- who knows why?&#41;  I&#39;m pretty bummed out about that.  I had a Digimon &#40;my husband did too&#41;, a Nano Bunny, several varieties of Tamagotchi, a Giga Pound &#40;it&#39;s got several different dogs in it&#41;, and a bunch of weird cheap import stuff that appeared all over the stores when the fad was at its peak.  It&#39;s all fun and colorful.  I used to go buy a new one every couple weeks.  :&#41;

One original digimon, plus the three games for PSX, I have a Furby I stole of the back of a truck, just to mutilate.  I skinned it, and replaced it to look like an evil, uh, thing for fun.

 I had a Pikachu Pocket 1&amp;2, a Tomagachi that i looked for all over Denver, Colorado to buy it  &#40;i have no clue where it is, and i think that some one had reset it before loosing it!&#41; i have an original, square, purple Digimon thing that i look at periodically but don&#39;t touch. I have an account on Neopets, my name is either zach_lechler or centaur_king, i love getting neo mail!

 I had one of those fish Tamagotchis, a Furby and my Pokemon craze lasted from ages 9 - 13. I still like the GameBoy games and would probably still like it if it wasn&#39;t for all the cheap hype that came out &#40;and the TV series&#41;.
