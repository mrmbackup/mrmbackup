 I forgot one thing, the port would need to be updated withall of the newer creatures and features that havebeen introduced in the last few Monster Rancher games.

 Sony takes a far larger cut of profits, and demands a lot more control over the games than Nintendo. Nintendo is also far more generous with dev tools -free as opposed to costing millions of dollars per tool with Sony. That&#39;s why the handheld games have stuck with Nintendo.

 Portable MR2, portable battles, toss in an online option for fights, set phasers to auto-buy. <BR> <BR>As far as I&#39;m concerned, they wouldn&#39;t have to change a single thing in the game, either. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a good idea in theory, but you know, theories don&#39;t always work out.

 It&#39;s also interesting to point out that the GBA games didn&#39;t sell very well at all. -Despite the fact that many of us thought that MRA2 was one of the best MR games ever made.

 If MR2 will be created for a PSP... I just wonder, how can you shrine monsters? Will it be the same as shrining in GBA?

 Lisa Shock: Nintendo was just as tyrannical in their &#34;early&#34; days when they were at the top as Sony is &#40;if what you say is even true and you&#39;re not just being bitter&#41;. Furthermore, companies make their handheld games for Nintendo because Nintendo has, so far, been the only company that&#39;s been able to succeed in the handheld market. <BR> <BR>I think the PSP would be better if not just because one would not have to worry about the cartridge issues that have occurred with the GBA Monster Rancher games -- it&#39;s a waste of money if the cart is just going to eventually fail. Though, I&#39;m not &#34;for&#34; a Monster Rancher 2 port. If I want to play Monster Rancher 2, I&#39;ll play it on my PSX. I&#39;d suggest they just make a new Monster Rancher game, but the last few Monster Rancher games have been awful -- I refuse to purchase them because they&#39;re garbage. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the point of playing a Monster Rancher game if you can&#39;t generate monsters from your CDs, anyways?

 Sony&#39;s dev tools cost between &amp;10m and $12m each, and a game generally requires 3-4 of these tools to work on the platform. Some larger companies &#40;2 to date&#41; have negotiated package deals on bundled purchases. <BR> <BR>But, this all said, sales of the MRA games were very, very weak. And, sales of the PS2 games have been increasingly smaller with each release, so any release for anything new platform would be viewed as a huge gamble by investors. -Those same investors who forced Tecmo&#39;s president and many of the developers to resign early this year following horrible sales of MR EVO.

 How does the DS work?  Doesn&#39;t it have two slots for gameboy games and DS games?  Would it be possible to use that for shrining?

 You can&#39;t have them both &#39;hot&#39; at the same time, and there&#39;s no way to keep the DS game live in RAM while turning on the GBA game. <BR> <BR>Even if you could shrine from GBA carts &#40;and, it&#39;s really not possible with the hardware&#41; you&#39;d need to own a LOT of GBA games to have a decent number of breeds -asuming the carts you owned didn&#39;t all make Worms. <BR> <BR>A DS game would have to use passwords like the GBA games, unless they worked out something with the WiFi system. But, honestly, MRA2 did a great job of being complex and having passwords. Many were locked, and secret, until you completed an in-game task and were handed the password. <BR> <BR>The PSP, since it supports those UMD movies, made some sense -if you ignore projected sales. &#40;There are far more GBA owners, and the MRA games sold miserably.&#41; But, now that the format is dead, and there aren&#39;t a whole lot of films available in the format, no one is going to get behind using the discs for a game.

 I think that it would be a great ide, having MR2 on the road. But on the other hand I don&#39;t know if it would work out.If Tecmo would actually decide to make the game&#40;emphasis on if&#41;, I have a feeling that the sales would be very poor, as many have lost faith in MR titles. Its fun to throw theories around, yet the problem is that theories can sound good then end bad,as with the theory of an MR RPG &#40;ehm...Evo, which I was all for, then ended up disapointed with the result&#41;. So my hands are tied on this one. I&#39;m just not sure.

 A game for the DS could use symbols or strokes drawn with the touch screen. Just a way to draw a main and sub from squiggles would do fine... like have you &#34;inscribe&#34; a tablet with two symbols, and they could be discovered in the course of the game. Or even one symbol for the main type inscribed on different color/flavor tablets &#40;to determine sub, including possibly rare tablets for ??? types&#41; that you find in adventures. <BR> <BR>Anyway, they could do a million things to successfully allow monster generation with the DS. No need for GBA carts at all, really. <BR> <BR>And, you know, everybody and their dog has a DS, plus you could have easy head to head online matches with their wifi &#40;for items? money?&#41;. It could be pretty sweet.

 And you could have your own unique symbol that you get after your first monster is retired. That symbol, after getting someone else&#39;s unique symbol and you use them both in a tablet, could make a really rare ??? monster. That&#39;s a stupid idea.. go on, tell me..

 Well, there&#39;d be one per species. It&#39;d just have the first letter of your nickname &#40;I.E. On my DS, my name is J-Dog. So, since the first monster I&#39;d make would be a Piroro, it&#39;d be a Piroro symbol with a J on it.&#41;

 Hrmn...with homebrew you can actually have monster rancher 2 for the psp right now. <BR> <BR>Any PSX .iso file can be ran with homebrew for the psp. <BR> <BR>Now, I doubt shrining would work but you&#39;d have the game... <BR> <BR>Right now sony is selling a few PSX games for the PSP in the PS3 store, these have been modified to work flawlessly on the PSP.  There&#39;s only like 10-15 total and i doubt MR2 is high on the list so  i doubt it will come about that way.
