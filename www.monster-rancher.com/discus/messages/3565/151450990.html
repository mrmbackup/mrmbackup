Honestly, I&#39;m a little nervous about posting this - I&#39;m new here at MR.com and I don&#39;t feel as if I&#39;ve become what you could properly call a &#34;regular&#34; plus this costing money for Mrs. Lisa Shock. So, if this is a problem for anyone, please feel free to delete it. <BR> <BR>The point being: I&#39;ve been a fan of Monster Rancher since roughly 9 or 10 years now so I decided to do a Let&#39;s Play &#40;playing through a game and making commentary on it&#41; of Monster Rancher Advance 2 on a small-time forum I helped set-up. Unfortunately, I lacked the common sense to take the full reigns of the story into my own hands - and gave my friends the option of making the character I&#39;d be telling the story through. As a result, I tell the story from the vantage point of a less-than-intelligent female. Currently I&#39;m up to just graduating to the A Rank and it&#39;s something of a bare-bones LP &#40;I&#39;m only going to show how to unlock some of the breeds like dragon and durahan&#41; namely as I don&#39;t want my monster to kick the bucket this late in the game. <BR> <BR>The link is: <A HREF="http://s1.zetaboards.com/Four_Against_Nature/topic/953285/1/" TARGET="_top">http://s1.zetaboards.com/Four_Against_Nature/topic/953285/1/</A> <BR> <BR>You don&#39;t need to be logged in to read it, but you have to if you want to post or give input. Let me know what you think, if you would! Thanks in advance, everyone. Sorry, again, if this post is inconvenient in any way!

 At first I thought it was kinda whack, but couldn&#39;t stop reading it, on the 3rd page now, it&#39;s cute :P

 Just updated early &#40;WAY early&#41; today. I&#39;ve hit kind of a pivotal moment that I&#39;d like some input on. If anyone would take the time out to not only read over it, but also contribute their thoughts on the matter &#40;Short version: my monster&#39;s too old to persist any further. What now?&#41;. Whether you post there or here, I&#39;ll see it. Thanks in advance!

 As much as I appreciate your enthusiasm, henger is one of the events I haven&#39;t done yet &#40;my next monster will, in addition to the Joker event and Ragnaroks due to her Gali sub-type&#41;. However, I&#39;m sure I can have a Subster the Henger in there somehow, even if it is at the very end of the LP. :&#41;

 First off, I apologize for the double post, but it is relevant. The LP has officially concluded. After 3-4 months of having the most fun I&#39;ve had with a Monster Rancher game since I picked up a new one &#40;EVO, I think?&#41;, it&#39;s all come to a head. Thank you, Lisa Shock, for allowing me to post this thread here. Thank you, Subster, for your active interest in the LP &#40;yes, I did raise a Henger named Subster. He was awesome&#41;. And thank you anyone else who even so much as took the time out to look at it. The thread will remain open for comments, questions, tips or contribution. Again, thank you for everything.
