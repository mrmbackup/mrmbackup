I&#39;m 39 <BR>Married <BR>Currently Live In Phoenix, AZ <BR>I&#39;m a vegetarian, science fiction fan and signed up for cryonic suspension. I&#39;m big on personal improvement, and striving for a positive future! <BR>My involvement in cryonics has been of some interest to others; I have been interviewed by BBC Television, Fuji TV, a station in Hong Kong, and U2&#39;s Zoo TV which aired as a half hour show on MTV in 1998.  <BR>I&#39;ve been programming computers since 1975, but rarely have done it as a job. I&#39;m a marketing professional in the videogame industry, and I beta test software part-time. I have been a freelance writer since my college days. Assignments have included: restaraunt reviewer, congressional coverage, television commercials, industrial video scripts and screenplays.  <BR>I restore old Cadillacs &#40;auto electric is my speciality&#41;, and collect items related to the space race. <BR>I&#39;m also a HUGE Trekkie, and I&#39;m listed as a reference in several books about Star Trek. Wired magazine uses me as an occasional Trek related fact-checker. <BR>I act in films whenever the opportunity arises, and can be seen in six so far. I have also acted in the occasional commercial, and done some voice-overs. <BR>Favorite cartoons include Duckman, Ren &amp; Stimpy, Big Guy and Rusty, and Daria.  <BR>I am a Blue Blaze Irregular. <BR>I was my college&#39;s Postmaster as an undergradutae. <BR>I play a wide variety of games, mostly sims, puzzles, and shooters. <BR>I listen to mostly &#39;alternative&#39; and punk music, but also have a fondness for modern classical music and the Italian Ars Nova. <BR>I don&#39;t have a favorite color, just don&#39;t like blue. <BR>I don&#39;t have a favorite monster, I enjoy seeing all of the unique traits Tecmo programmed into the game.

 I have a new profile. More like battle stats but here it is. <BR>Name: N/A &#40;I go by Draconic Leader but I have no name&#41; <BR> <BR>Height: 20&#39;7&#34; <BR> <BR>Tail Length:23&#39;1&#34; <BR> <BR>Wing span: 47&#39;8&#34; <BR> <BR>Birthdate:N/A &#40;I have existed since time began&#41;  <BR> <BR>Bithplace:an uncharted region of thew universe untouched by all except for my kind <BR> <BR>Looks: I am the creator and leader of all dragons. My most famous creation is that of Bahamut. I created them from my DNA but then I altered it so that they wouldn&#39;t be as great as me&#40;can&#39;t have your creations kill yourself now can you?&#41;. With that said you should have a basic idea what I look like. Here&#39;s some specifics. I have black and dark blue skin. My arms are slightly muscular. I have long black horns. I have silver hair that looks much like Kuja&#39;s in the back but has long strands of spiked hair that covers most of my face. <BR> <BR>Weapon: my claws&#40;wing, hand, and foot claws&#41; <BR> <BR>Abilities: All Magic learned plus the ability to cast flare star, curse&#40;Ozma version&#41;, and use Ultima Flare. <BR> <BR>Special Notes: I am immortal and cannot be killed but when my HP are nil my spirit leaves my material body for no less than a milennium. I cannot have any abnormal status put on me except haste, regen, reflect, and poison &#40;which I absorb and acts like regen for me&#41;. I have no elemental weaknesses or strengths. My power is absolute crap but my magic attack is so strong no one knows its number value. My physical def. is very high&#40;so much that omnislash and lionheart combined might do 1 HP of damage if lucky&#41; but my magic defense is slightly better than average. My speed is also very low. Surprisingly my evasion is very high though. My HP are in the 32,000 area. <BR>These are more FFish stats apparently. <BR> <BR>My favorite color: silver <BR> <BR>Fav. Games: Final Fantasy I,VII,VIII,IX, and Lunar Silver Star Story <BR> <BR>Fav. anime: Tenchi Muyo, Outlaw Star, Trigun, &#40;this is gonna throw ya off and okay I never saw it but it sounded pretty cool in my Animerica and it has lots of kawaii girls&#41;Mischievous Witch DoReMi&#40;so I like shoujo anime and I&#39;m a guy SUE ME!!!&#41; <BR> <BR>Fav. bands/artists: Limp Bizkit, Korn, Ludacris, Ice Cube, DMX, Method Man <BR>Anger me you shall not for revenge I will seek.

 ... OK, since I&#39;ve just joined up, I&#39;ll introduce myself with my first post here. <BR> <BR>-- The &#34;JT&#34; in my handle is my first two initials. <BR> <BR>-- I&#39;m not Dutch.  It&#39;s just a nickname.  If you&#39;ve ever watched the movie &#34;Hoodlum&#34;, you know what I&#39;m talking about. <BR> <BR>-- I&#39;m an American, btw.  I live very close to Los Angeles, California.  I&#39;ve lived here almost all my life. <BR> <BR>-- I&#39;m 29, a hetero guy, and I&#39;m not married.  Don&#39;t have any kids, either.  I&#39;m an Uncle, though.  That&#39;s good enough for right now. <BR> <BR>-- I work as a hotel night manager.  I&#39;ve been in the hotel biz for about 8 years. <BR> <BR>-- My hobbies are reading &#40;mostly historical works&#41;, playing and watching sports &#40;hockey, baseball and basketball&#41;, and video games &#40;strategy and RPGs&#41;.  I&#39;ve owned or borrowed about every video game console known to man, including the old Odyssey system. <BR> <BR>-- I&#39;ve been writing to online message boards for about 5 years. <BR> <BR>-- My interest in Monster Rancher spawned from a very simple &#40;and annoying&#41; virtual-pet game called RakuRaku Dinokun that came out in the mid-90&#39;s.  It was often a silly, stupid game; but I liked the premise of it, and Monster Rancher built on that premise very well.
