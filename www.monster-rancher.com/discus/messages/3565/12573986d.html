<CENTER><U>Why I Hate GameFAQs</U></CENTER> <BR> <BR>Hello, greetings, and all other formal forms of welcoming. My name is Justin, but perhaps I’m better known as “Infernus” &#40;sometimes with a 93&#41; or “Ataraxis” to some of you. The beauty of the online community – you can pick any sort of name you like, use it, and no matter how strange it is, not seem like a fool. Now, I have managed to visit one place, where no matter how wise or normal you are &#40;or is it the more wise and normal you are?&#41;, you will seem foolish there. If not that, you will seem foolish for going there. Thousands upon thousands of morons go in hoards to discuss their passions, to argue over whether Superman or Batman is better, making topics that last five hundred posts and then finally have to be closed over this sort of thing! This abomination to the online community, this hell on the web, this is a little place we like to call…GameFAQs. <BR> <BR>Now, not everyone at GF is bad. You have your knowledgeable people, or your friendly social people. Combined I’d say that these people make up about half the site. However, then there’s the boards where there’s nothing but fanboys who absolutely refuse to be wrong, no matter how wrong they are. Using arguments like “I never lie!”, or “My friend believes me!”, or the slightly more moronic “My friend told me it was true!”, even when they, personally, have never seen it. In actuality, I highly doubt these people have friends. At first assumption, you’d think these people had just reached the age limit of thirteen a few days ago, but no, they’ve reached legend &#40;or higher&#41; status, they’ve been there quite some time.  And if you ask, they’re always fifteen or older. The dumbest ones tend to go for the biggest stretch and say they’re in their twenties or thirties. Yes, like any of us bought that. <BR> <BR>Now, what exactly does it mean to be a legend &#40;or higher&#41; at GameFAQs…? Nothing. It means you’ve been there longer. It means you’ve made your same crappy posts, throwing the same BS lies at people, screwing them up, because they’re stupid enough to believe you, because you’re a legend &#40;or higher&#41;. I mean, really, you must know everything! Too bad you don’t, you ignorant jack ass. You just made that guy waste 1,000,000 gold, it took him three months to get that. Now I guess you’ll start a flame war, then go infect another board. This happens quite a bit. I don’t understand what kind of kicks you’d get out of wasting someone’s time like that. I’m a pretty twisted fellow. I can see someone getting kicks out of blowing up things, burning things, etc, but not out of wasting someone’s time. By the way, I do not endorse the blowing up, burning, etc of things. <BR> <BR>So now we conclude that the rankings system is the spawn of someone’s fifteen minutes spent on the crapper. Not all ranking systems of course, hell, some work. Good, truthful posters are rewarded, and advanced. It means something. Their purpose is so the lower level members have someone to judge off of for how they should post. The some sites have no ranking system. This works just as well. With the exception of a select few to do maintenance, everyone has equal chances at respect. Those that do their part and make quality posts will be known and respected by all. And it will show in how people reply to them. <BR> <BR>Also, the marking system on GameFAQs…it’s crap. Two people are required to mark a message before it even gets looked at. Now, what happens if someone has no friends on a board, everyone insults them, and they really do need help? They can mark messages all they want, and no one is going to help them. The moderators there, as difficult as their job is, are also not the greatest. I, personally, have seen people get picked on by moderators, just because they had an opinion. The people who are in power, the people who are supposed to be the most respectful, ridicule a legitimate opinion, one that didn’t discriminate or cause harm to anyone. What kind of example is this? <BR> <BR>“Go find somewhere else!” Ah, a message that is heard far too often. Now, I think that many of the people that get told this would find somewhere else – unfortunately, GameFAQs often has the best information &#40;other than single-game dedicated sites&#41;. As mean as the people are, they tend to know their games. Now, shouldn’t people be able to be banned for this? How is it any different from the lunchroom at school, when little Johnny wants to sit with someone, and they all tell him to “get lost!” This is bullying, and in some schools, especially elementary schools, can get children suspended. There, it’s boiled down to they key comparison. Many GF users are like elementary students. I’m sure some of them are elementary students. <BR> <BR>In conclusion, I leave a few words of wisdom for you, for any place you go: <BR> <BR>1: Just because your friend told you so, it doesn’t mean it’s true. <BR>2: No matter how much you’d like to believe it, you do lie. Unless you’re Jesus. <BR>3: You’re not Jesus. <BR>4: There are under age users out there. Do what you can about them &#40;notify authorities&#41;, then do your best to avoid them. <BR>5: There are people out there who are idiots. As much as they’d like to argue, only give them an answer once. Take the time to make sure it’s right, lest you have to come back and make another. <BR>6: Getting the opinion of more than one person on any given matter is a good idea. <BR>7: You are not God’s gift to the world. Some people will not like you. Don’t cry, live with it. <BR>8: Nobody likes a suck-up. <BR>9: You’re not better than anyone else just because you’re a “legend”. Also, those people who are at higher ranks are no better than you. It’s all in the posts. And better posters tend to have less posts, because they get what they have to say through the first time. <BR>10: Sometimes, you’re wrong. <BR>11: Whatever game/console/whatever you are fanboy for, sucks. Many people think this. The best way to avoid any problems is to say: “That’s your opinion, which you are entitled to. I however find great enjoyment from &#91;insert object of affection&#93;.” <BR>12: Batman beats the crap out of Superman, strictly due to the fact that he’s more insane. <BR> <BR>This is my rant. Thank you for your time. It&#39;s nice to get that off my chest. I apologize for any crappy grammar - I&#39;m somewhat frustrated, and this is relatively long.

 Batman is rich. Powers are for sissies who can afford to make things that don&#39;t even exist yet. <BR> <BR>Sort of a joke anyway. The fact of the matter is they&#39;re both good guys, and on the same side. So why would they fight each other...?

 Because the losers at Marvel wanted to stall the making of the &#34;Ender&#39;s Game&#34; moe, which will be done by the same studio... <BR> <BR>And I must belong to the second half, because I don&#39;t find any flamers or trolls with the exceptiin of  &#34;n00bs&#34;.

 Batman beats superman because superman is completely fake. If you think about it, batman could exist because he is an ordinary peron. Batman beats superman because superman is just not real, but batman is a little bit of a realistic fiction deal.

 Don&#39;t take it personally, but how long did it take you to find out that the GameFAQs community is a step below the Neopet&#39;s community?  That site as some great info on games, but Lord Almighty the majority of the community is too stupid for words to justly describe it &#40;Just go to the fighting game and popular threads&#41;.   <BR> <BR>Try not to take the GameFAQs community seriously.  It&#39;ll make your head hurt.

 I forgot to mention how much I love the &#34;insiders&#34; who brag how they&#39;re so close to Developer X when they&#39;re literally the dumbest 16 year-olds I&#39;ve had the privilege of seeing.  They&#39;re even funnier when they don&#39;t defend themselves &#40;like that loser Bigbangboom from the 2002 Monster Rancher 2 Advance&#41;.

 How long? Not long at all, actually. The thing is, I reached my breaking point that day and just had to vent. As for neopets...never been there. Will never go there. <BR> <BR>And yes, I forgot about the people who know such and such person of such and such company.
