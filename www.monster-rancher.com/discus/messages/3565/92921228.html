 i finally found my favorite mr3 quote - the description of hohocto, an octopee subbreed: <BR> <BR>This Octopee lives in trees. However, they are very bad at climbing, so once they fall out of a tree, they can&#39;t get back up again.  <BR> <BR>it sounds to me like hohoctoes live in trees, until they suddenly don&#39;t anymore!  and it isn&#39;t like baby hohoctoes somehow get back into the trees to begin the process again.  bottom line:  hohoctoes live in trees, except they really don&#39;t.

 Maybe only a few fall, and they are doomed to live there. The others live all their lives &#40;and reproduce&#41; in the trees.

 maybe as soon as they fall out of a tree they  <BR>aren&#39;t a hohoctoe any more? But then, how can you  <BR>raise one at a ranch? My head hurts....

 pt&#39;s explanation makes sense, but that seems to create two tribes of hohoctoes.  disrupts my vision of hohoctoes living in unity and harmony...

 If they&#39;re bad at climbing, why live in the trees? Maybe that&#39;s how breeders get them. They walk around and poke at them with sticks. Knock them out of the tree, then take them home. But if they&#39;re bad climbers, what do they eat? Do they just sit up there with their mouths open, waiting for birds? My head is starting to hurt, too... <BR> <BR>Oh, Found another great quote: Colt- &#40;after finding Joker Mask&#41; &#34;I wonder if they used to put it on and dance like this...&#34; Dr.Talrico- &#34;NO!&#34;  <BR>Then later, when Pabs sees it: Pabs- &#34;Wow, that&#39;s one creepy mask. I wonder if they used to wear it like this? Oh no! I can&#39;t take it off!&#34; Dr. Talrico- &#34;I can&#39;t believe he tried it on without at least studying it first.&#34; <BR> <BR>Does the Joker mask make people into idiots? Exactly HOW did Colt think they danced? What does a clown mask have to do with dancing anyway? From Colt, that&#39;s suprising. &#40;But I think I&#39;d like to see the dance&#41;. From Pabs, I expected as much. I think if you told Pabs your Gaboo had a stomach problem, he&#39;d put his head into it&#39;s mouth and look.  <BR> <BR>And if he&#39;s such a good rancher, how come he&#39;s not busy raising his own &#42;&amp;$#%@$ monsters, instead of strolling over to my ranch whenever he feels like it, taking a dip in my hot springs, and putting crazy masks on his head?

 my take on pabs - he&#39;s a blowhard wannabe who got lucky with one monster &#91;most&#93; and spends the rest of his life lording it over everyone.

 Ah... I haven&#39;t got to Most. Didn&#39;t realize he&#39;s the trainer. Makes me dislike him even more. I wish you&#39;d get to see Pabs house when Colt says &#34;let&#39;s go to Pabs house&#34; when construction is being done on yours. I bet it&#39;s full of empty cup jells, paradoxine, twinkies, nudie mags, dirty clothes and cheap beer. And the binoculars he uses to watch Colt, of course. <BR> <BR>It would be funnier if Pabs was a letcherous old man, making passes at Colt. At least then I would understand why he&#39;s always at the ranch.

 Actually, a running gag that brought Thorr and I  <BR>endless laughs was thinking of Karn&#40;ab&#41; as a  <BR>dirty old man in MR1.  <BR> <BR>He had a real unhealthy relationship with Holly  <BR>where he took her and your monster off into the  <BR>wilderness for a month at a time.  <BR> <BR>That, in my mind, is the real reason Holly  <BR>doesn&#39;t want to explore at the beginning of MRA2.

 Anything that Holly says about the mock while it&#39;s growing as a tree in mr2, I can&#39;t think of any, but it&#39;s translated so badly it just seems really funny. Oh, and &#34;I cannot wait to get all&#34;. Don&#39;t ask why, it just is.

 There&#39;s a year where she thinks she sees it move, then says &#34;of course, I must be imagining. Trees can&#39;t move.&#34; <BR> <BR>She also didn&#39;t know what a Durahan was...

 Part of Colt&#39;s moving speech upon obtaining Master rank: &#34;An amount of time that feels long ago and also short, has passed since we first met here.&#34; What poetry... <BR> <BR>I just unlocked the Metaliner. I couldn&#39;t believe the thing left a crop circle! But did anyone notice how rude Pabs is to Colt the whole time? He tells her to shut up, and says other mean stuff to her. Then again, she says this, which is so far my favorite quote:  <BR>&#34;Wow! We&#39;re gonna have a close encounter of the 3rd kind tonight, right?&#34;

 i think the game assumes the player will unlock metalners before reaching the legend cup.  by the time pabs gets around to making a speech to open the legend cup &#91;when most is competing&#93;, colt is not so supportive.

 I really would like to see a grand finale where Pabs has something awful happen to him. Most bites off his leg, aliens take him away, a Zilla sits on him, he gets trapped in a Bajarl pot, etc. <BR> <BR>That could be a fun post topic: What would be the best revenge on Pabs? <BR> <BR>My vote is for getting inhaled by a Baku, then coming out the other end...

 Perhaps if Pabs was killed and it unlocked a monster &#40;like three others in the game&#41;, except that the result had worse starting stats than either Charles or Gonzales.

 He could be killed by the Wracky. <BR>Colt: &#34;Charles, NOOOOOOooooOOOoo! What have you done! Pabs! Who&#39;s going to clean this up?&#34; <BR> <BR>Then the monster you got would be Pab&#39;s decapitated head. It would attack with int based sleep and bore attacks, baking the monsters tired. Would have a close range babble attack, E/S/S/E, and pow moves like &#34;Shut up&#34; and &#34;overbite&#34;. And when it dies, instead of a funeral, everyone throws a party on the ranch.

 I forget the exact wording, but the entire &#34;Magic pot&#34; conversation when you unlock bajarl is hilarious. &#34;What are you doing?
