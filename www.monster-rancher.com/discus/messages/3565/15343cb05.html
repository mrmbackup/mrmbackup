 So let me ask you guys something. Has anyone tried playing MR 1 or 2 on their Playstation 3? If so, what has it been like for you? <BR> <BR>I bought myself a PS3 for X-mas and so I wound up playing a new file on MR 1. It&#39;s been interesting to ocme home again, but in a new way. The PS3 lets you shrine DVDs, which is cool. Unfortunately, it&#39;s like shrining PS1 games, in that most movies result in pure breeds, and since I don&#39;t like raising pures, don&#39;t work out very well for me. <BR> <BR>Graphically, well, 32 bit graphics dont benefit as much as you would think from a high definition resolution. Especially on small or baby monsters the pixelation is pretty gross. I find that I have to play from about 6-8 feet away on the big screen, but that&#39;s the kind of problem that we all should have, right? <BR> <BR>Gameplay is everything I remembered it was. Except I cant remember where to find that stupid Wind Drum.. somewhere in that jungle I think, having no luck turning it up. Other than that, everything is just too easy. I beat the big 4 almost on accident with my first dedicated explorer &#40;a Plant/Dino named Roger. Roger the Shrub, if there are any Python fans in the house&#41;, and he himself came straight from a disc. Since then every monster I have raised has gone on to do the same, which is nothing to complain about but, again, it&#39;s too easy. I&#39;m starting to miss the brutal challenge that MR 2 was. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t made that leap yet though. It took me so much work and time to crack MR 2 that the notion of starting over on it is a bit daunting. On the other hand, there&#39;s no real sense of accomplishment in what I am doing now. Maybe I&#39;ll max out a monster so that I can slate it over in MR2 as a baby with 249 on all stats, make those early years a little more bearable. <BR> <BR>Well that&#39;s enough rambling out of me. Anyone else out there have any stories to tell?

 yeah there are quite a few places that can do that for you. <BR> <BR>So has anyone else started a new file on 1 or 2 recently? Or anyone tried them on the PS3?

 you can play MR 2 on the PSP? Do you use UMDs to shrine? I&#39;m very curious about that. MR 2 that I could play everywhere... that has serious badass implications.

Actually I just finished imputting gameshark codes for CWCheat. <BR> <BR>You really can&#39;t use the shrine on the PSP, well you can but it&#39;s such a huge hassel that it&#39;s a moot point. <BR> <BR>Anyway, if you have CWCheat then you can use gameshark codes. I just finished typing out the workings to be able to change any main type and subtype in any of the frozen slots. <BR> <BR>How I&#39;m doing it is freezing a lab full of market mocchis, then using CWCheat to modify their Main/Sub. For example, I changed a Mocchi/Mocchi in slot 10 to a Pixie/Pixie and a Mocchi/Mocchi in slot 9 to a Worm/Worm. Saved and then combined the two, boom Red Worm. <BR> <BR>I think if you don&#39;t combine them then they will still level up like a Mocchi/Mocchi but I&#39;m not positive about this. <BR> <BR>Basically in game I boot up CWCheat and check yes to the monster I want and putting them in the lab, boom you don&#39;t need any discs.  <BR> <BR>I am being good though and not adding any monsters to the lab that I haven&#39;t already unlocked. But yeah, having MR2 on the go is amazing! Now I have something to do while the little lady watches intervention and other boring shows, MR2!!! <BR> <BR>If I get permission I&#39;ll post the codes on here and how to make them work, but I don&#39;t want to break any rules so I&#39;ll wait to get the OK. The codes that come with CWCheat didn&#39;t work for me so I had to make new stuff.  <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re interested and I&#39;m not given permission to post it here then email me at <BR><A HREF="mailto:HalfAssedChaos@gmail.com">HalfAssedChaos@gmail.com</A> <BR>and I&#39;ll send you the file you would need and steps on how to get it going. <BR> <BR>Oh you will need a hacked and homebrewed PSP to do this, like pretty much all other PSX games they haven&#39;t released on PSN. <BR> <BR>Also I am going to note that I am not a pirate and do not support the illegal download of games. I own multible copies of MR2! :D

 Hehe I bought a second PSP for the express purpose of hacking it so I can have all of my older gen games on the go! It&#39;s freaking awesome! <BR> <BR>When did you get your PSP and what gen is it, 1000, 2000, 3000?

 I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a 1000. I got it a few years back, and then like a week later the next gen version came out. Stupid, because I work in video games, I should have known.

 Well if it a 1000 &#40;the thicker PSP version&#41; then all of those are hackable and what a lot of people prefer.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s pretty easy to hack them, just have to do a bit of research. I just hacked mine to play old games though, I don&#39;t think I can use UMDs on it &#40;but I have a 3000 for those&#41;, but there are ways of being able to play both UMDs and old games. <BR> <BR>If any of your friends know how to do it I would suggest asking them, otherwise there are a lot of Youtube videos explaining it. Having MR2 on the go really is amazing, I won&#39;t lie.

 I hacked my PSP a while back to see if MR 2 would work on it, so I&#39;d have something to fall back on if my disc/PS2 ever stop working, but I never got around to trying it. I&#39;m glad to see that it works... in a way. At least I&#39;d have something to go to if my disc ever fades away... <BR> <BR>Anyways, I don&#39;t have a PS3, so I can&#39;t try it on there... but if I did, the first game I would play is MR 2. <BR> <BR>I still can&#39;t believe that the series has resorted to nothing but a DS game, that has taken over a year to release in English... <BR>Thinking about or playing Monster Rancher hurts me now, more than it makes me happy. <BR>So I really don&#39;t play it anymore.... although, very recently I&#39;ve wanted to. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still waiting for the day when I become a billionaire and buy the rights to Monster Rancher &#40;and the Deception series&#41; and make new console games with all the monsters. <BR>Yep... a man can dream, a man can dream.....

 I&#39;ve played MR 2 on my ps3.  It plays just like when it was new, though I could be wrong but I think it shrines a little faster?

 Can you shrine DVDs on MR2 as well if you play it on PS3? Because that, I think, would be the one thing that would put it over the edge, for me. <BR> <BR>I know, of course, that with the right breeding style any monster can be a champion, but for me the excitement and mystery of finding out what is &#34;hidden&#34; on my discs is a big part of the fun.

 I play it on my PS3 now, and I&#39;ve noticed that it shrines slower for me but definitely plays as though  <BR>new despite the many ominous scratches coating the disk. In my experience however, when it comes to  <BR>shrining DVD&#39;s and other PS3 games I have only ever managed to get a Hachiro &#40;Zuum/Baku&#41; or a pure  <BR>Gaboo. I would however like to point out that this is not a bad thing, as I love Gaboos and with so  <BR>many coming along I have 2 or 3 that start with 180&#43; of its 3 better stats.

 As far as I know the game is not able to read the codeing for DVD&#39;s/Blueray&#39;s so it will give you one of a very limited number of generic monsters.  Someone can correct me if I&#39;m wrong but as the game was made on a system which was not capable of reading these media formats the game itself was never programed to read them.
