 I say we delete the CD lists. They take up too much space, take too much mod time and are practically useless. Either you have the CD or you don&#39;t, I seriously doubt people will start hunting for cds/dvds they don&#39;t already have. Most common monsters are obtainable from common cd/dvds, in-game saucer stones and combination/evolution. Sub-code data probably is or will be posted for the rarer monsters and for the oddities &#40;like the all 25 monol&#41;.  <BR> <BR>A CD/DVD list is the most useless info this site will ever possess. It makes us look like amateurs.

 I wouldn&#39;t say hunting, but if it&#39;s a &#39;recent&#39; game or movie, I sure as heck might go out and rent it. If I know a friend who has that CD, I&#39;ll borrow it from him/her. I think that all though the CD list may be taking up quite a lot of mod time, it will take less time than having to redirect 20&#43; some posts of where to find a specific breed... Wouldn&#39;t you think so?

 I disagree with you completely on this one PT, sorry. <BR> <BR>1&#41; King is correct about it causing more trouble than it  <BR>would solve. As it is, any QA queries can be answered with  <BR>a simple point to the archive. Without it, we&#39;d have to  <BR>answer every request and then delete it after it was seen. <BR> <BR>2&#41; I don&#39;t see your point about it making us look like  <BR>amateurs. There is enough other content to dispel that  <BR>notion easily. <BR> <BR>3&#41; while the List itself may be of questionable importance,  <BR>it serves one really good purpose. It provides a simple, low  <BR>stress way for new members to contribute to the site. I feel  <BR>it is a great gateway forum for people, without the stress of  <BR>&#34;hard research&#34; It&#39;s a great way to play &#34;look what i found&#34;  <BR>without allowing brag posting. <BR> <BR>I say keep the archive. Keep an eye on it for quality and  <BR>clarity, but don&#39;t delete it. Maybe a little more diligence  <BR>about locking off breeds that we have found &#34;enough&#34;  <BR>entries for, like I did for Henger on day 3 :&#124;

 That&#39;s exactly it. The only reasons we keep it is to shut newbies up and to give the illusion of contributing to the site. That&#39;s what I find pathetic and amateurish &#40;trying to please even the lowest,laziest players&#41;. It doesn&#39;t help you build your ranch, doesn&#39;t make you a better breeder, it is useless data.  <BR> <BR>I also think a lot of the lists popping up in the MR4 section are superfluous. A lot of them are just descriptions easily found in-game.

 I, for one, used the CD list just this week to find out if I owned a CD with a Raiden on it. <BR> <BR>Lo and behold, I&#39;m raising my Gargoyle now &#40;Raiden/Naga&#41;. <BR> <BR>Frankly, it just wouldn&#39;t seem like an Archive without a CD list, but I do agree about some of the lesser ones. Seriously, who is going to look in the CD list to find a Henger in MR4 or a Melon Suezo in MR2? :/ <BR> <BR>I think knocking the CD lists down to the locked breeds per each MR game would be best. Those are the monsters people have problems finding anyway, and if you go through the trouble of unlocking them, you&#39;d certainly want to raise them. That way, when someone does find one of those CDs, they can still post the finding. <BR> <BR>Of course, it would give us lots of free room for tourneys, cafe topics, just about anything else. With the encyclopedia in MR4, I&#39;m going to go through all my CDs and DVDs anyway, regardless what&#39;s on what. <BR> <BR>In the end, I got to back PT in the &#34;Nobody cares about Mocchi CDs&#34;

 While some of the more common monsters may not need postings, remember that commonality can be an illusion to an individual poster.  That is to say, you may get a lot of a certain monster, and think it to be pretty common, when other people are searching high and low for it.  While I doubt anyone will lose sleep trying to find an MR4 Henger or an MR2 Melon Suezo, people HAVE asked for the MR4 Phoenix-- and I have about a dozen CDs that apparently make it &#40;as that&#39;s the only thing I haven&#39;t unlocked yet and the game won&#39;t let me access them&#41;.  It&#39;s also good for shorthand, in that I can quickly look at the CD lists and see what possible subtypes a monster can have, allowing me to plan my breeding programs better.  Overall, I think it&#39;s very much worth it to keep the CD List around-- especially if Lisa thinks so, because she&#39;s the one paying for it all.

 I agree that once you have one of every monter you don&#39;t need a list to find the, you can mix them yourself, but as for the Rare monsters I would love to keep a list of those, for you may know someone who has this CD, DVD, or game and could borrow it or even rent it.

 Phoenix is also a rare monster, Nate, further backing my original point. <BR> <BR>Common monsters are not as hard to find, and after you get one, you have the encyclopedia save so you don&#39;t have to worry about finding the CD again. After all, the most powerful monsters are combined from two powerful monsters themselves, so raising the father for your future champion won&#39;t matter if you use the CD or Encyclo. <BR> <BR> <BR>After I unlock a breed, I&#39;d like to know what CD its on, which is way, at the least, we should keep the locked monster CD lists for each game.

 I have always found the CD lists useful, even for MR4. I don&#39;t think that there has been a game yet that I didn&#39;t use it to nab rares or hard to find breeds &#40;not always the &#34;rare&#34; ones&#41;. If list spam is a problem, lock the lists. But, not everyone has access to a CD burner.

 And new CDs and DVDs come out everyday, Lao. In the long run, locking the list will make people only question why they are locked. And if we can&#39;t update the newest CD and DVD findings, because they are locked, then why have them in the first place. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll admit, different CD collections are in everyone&#39;s home. However, I think the difference between someone going and renting a DVD for a Phoenix and someone attempting to get a pure bred Pancho in the same fashion is quite self explanatory.

 The difference isn&#39;t self-explanatory. From an in-game perspective, there&#39;s not much reason to prefer a Phoenix to a Dragon. A Beaclon also serves. Nor a Tiger to a Zuum. Pancho may seem like an easy target, but somebody out there likes them, and from a game perspective they&#39;re equivalent to a bunch of other monsters. I&#39;ve always thought that Tigers were stupid, and they seem to be one of the series favorites. Point being, a Phoenix is not more important than a Pancho. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m advocating functional restraints, which are workable &#40;list locks, merging all subs into a single breed list, whatever&#41;, instead of entirely dropping a resource which more people probably use than the FAQs, let alone the &#34;non-amateurish&#34; method building/maxing, etc. <BR> <BR>This old breeder&#39;s opinion: keep the CD lists any way you can. They&#39;re far and away more useful than a lot of other things on here &#40;monster/item description lists, tourney opponent stats, etc&#41;.

From a CD List contributor perspective, I think the lists DO serve a valid purpose; Most of which has been stated in a few of the aforementioned posts.  I would like to add one other thing in the realm of downsizing some of the space the Lists may be using.  I&#39;ve noticed several CD Listings that contain some unrelated dialog rather than the CD information.  Also, in the reference to those Monsters that have a large access ratio &#40;meaning there&#39;s more than 10 CDs that can generate it&#41;, perhaps a cut off at the 10th listing with an additional comment stating that there&#39;s no need for additional posts migh help.  Perhaps if both of those sets of posts are deleted, a little more space may become available. <BR> <BR>Just my MR.04 cents worth!  <FONT FACE="WINGDINGS">&#74;</FONT>

 I&#39;ve found the CD/DVD lists to be quite useful. Granted, my breeder experience is limited to MR3 and some MR4&#40;just got it last week&#41; so I&#39;m probably considered an &#34;amateur&#34;, but if I want to play a dragon NOW without going through 300 cds/dvds in the hopes of finding one, it&#39;s a great place to check to see if someone else found it in something I have already. Plus, since most listings seem to come from users personal collections, it&#39;s a way to get to know them. Someone&#39;s taste in music and other media says a lot about them.

 Gentleranchers, Good day.  <BR>Please allow me to introduce myself, by adding a slightly different direction to this discussion.  <BR> <BR>Up until this point, the question has been one of &#34;Is the CD List really useful.&#34; And the discussion has been along the lines of: <BR> <BR>Not really, it&#39;s too much trouble. <BR> <BR>vs. <BR> <BR>Yes, I find it useful. <BR> <BR>With many gray areas in between. <BR> <BR>As many are, I am of a middling opinion on this. I&#39;ve yet to find a CD List where I had more that 4 of the CD&#39;s. &#40;This was for MR2, but anyway..&#41; <BR> <BR>However... Let me suggest a different solution to the problem. I am a programmer, by profession, with some skill in the areas of database design and web interface creation. So what occurs to &#42;me&#42; is that someone could host a CD List off site from the discussion group, with a web interface to a DB.  <BR> <BR>Of course, what this solution needs is a place to host it. I have a small site, perhaps slightly smaller than this one, which I mostly use for the hosting of my email. I rarely do much with my bandwidth.  <BR> <BR>So what I would suggest is that myself &#40;with semi-limited time&#41; and a team of volunteers create an application by which the CD List can be moved outside of the boards, so the moderators do not have to deal with them. The boards could still have the CD List discussion group, with a pointer to the new app. <BR> <BR>But, that&#39;s all just my two cents. If anyone has thoughts on the idea, they are begged to share them. <BR> <BR>Kalach

 Ever since we moved, people have suggested moving parts of the site to free servers, their own servers, free BBs systems, etc. So far, every one of those people has been around a while, then left -never to be heard from again. We have literally seen thousands of MR sites appear and fade away over the years, and tens of thousands of people have done the same. <BR> <BR>And, of course, there is the stellar example of Ethel at DBW who ran the site for a few months then just left it, never cleaning up the bad entries that were posted before she went to an email only system, thus maintaining some of the worst &#39;information&#39; online. <BR> <BR>Then, of course, there&#39;s the constant risk to the site itself; in a nutshell the whole reason we are here in the first place, rather than our old, free home on LUSENET. <BR> <BR>Actually doing this set up would take several things:  <BR>&#42;several people willing to moderate it who have the ability to check in several times a day, every day &#40;if you allow members to add their own posts -remember Josie&#39;s database with people entering obscenities daily? -or B&#39;s, where if he left for a couple days, porno would be posted in the CD list?&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;several people to process emails daily &#40;if you run it like DBW was run, with submission via email&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;several people willing to monitor the user accounts, creating them, emailing people who have technical problems, getting rid of troublemakers <BR> <BR>&#42;someone to check on the site and software at least once a day, twice is preferrable. <BR> <BR>The fact is, we have a very small group of people doing this already here. We simply don&#39;t have the resources to double our efforts for another site, unless you have a team with several hours a day free to work on it, every day, year-round.

Glad to hear the voice of caution and wisdom. Let me clarify a few things: <BR> <BR>#1 --&#62; I would not host another forum/BB/whatever system. I actually have a small one tucked away that myself and friends use. I&#39;m not interested in the headaches that I know you go through to maintain this. I am also not interested in presenting a site for discussion. <BR> <BR>#2 --&#62; You suggest that I will show up, provide the service and then disappear like so many others. I give me your guarantee that you are... likely right. I&#39;m married, with a full time job, and trying to maintain some semblence of a social life. I cannot guarantee the time I can dedicate to maintaining user maintenance, etc. for a site like this.  <BR> <BR>#3 --&#62; However, the site will be around. I currently pay for hosting, in order to have a mail server to host my domain. Why? Because I like having an email address: <A HREF="mailto:seth@corduan.net">seth@corduan.net</A>. It means a good much to me. The site will remain. <BR> <BR>#4 --&#62; I would rather someone much more dedicated than I to Monster rancher take care of the &#34;oversite&#34; account issues, such as they are. I am offering a site and some help in creating the application.  <BR> <BR>#5 --&#62; I would assume that the userbase would be limited because this is the only place I would want the site to be publicized. I will not be submitting it to any search engines, etc... I would rather only people with verified accounts on this board be able to add CD information.

 I had a nice long thoughtful post about all this on Jan5, that apparently I never actually posted. Ah well I am too sick and tired to come up with all of it again now. My main points boil down to this: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Can we keep this on topic? We are talking about the usefulness of the CD list, not the usefulness of all content on MRM or in the MR4 section. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Just because you personally don&#39;t find something useful doesn&#39;t mean someone else won&#39;t. Don&#39;t look at the transcriptions of ingame lists as the end of the project either. I know I plan to add and consolidate other info in those lists once the lists are complete. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Here&#39;s the big one and I want it answered well before I&#39;ll even entertain the notion of agreeing with removing a big section. What do you propose we replace it with? What in your mind is non amateurish? I hear a lot about getting rid of things, but no options given for what would replace them. The work that is being put up is the work that people want and have time to contribute to. If you have a better idea then get to work on it and post it!

 First, I want to correct what I said earlier. The disk list isn&#39;t really too much work &#40;especially since I don&#39;t touch it&#41;. It&#39;s just something I wrote too fast.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t propose we replace it with anything. I&#39;d just like it removed. My description of the list as:&#34;It doesn&#39;t help you build your ranch, doesn&#39;t make you a better breeder...&#34; pretty much sums up my idea of what amateurish is. I could elaborate but I fear I&#39;d have to go where I don&#39;t want to. &#40;and my time on the work cpu is up...&#41;

 So, basically what you seem to be saying is: <BR> <BR>Whether you can get X monster off of X CD is irrelevant to the game play for the most part. In the long run &#40;unless you are pixe_person or gali_giant&#41; it just doesn&#39;t matter. Let&#39;s focus on those things that are important, like training methods, lifespan testing, etc... <BR> <BR>I guess one answer to this would be to ask why the Shrine was even put into the game at all...

 Feel free to elaborate PT, because as long as your argument   <BR>boils down to &#34;I think the CD list is silly, and I don&#39;t want it  <BR>around any more&#34; Then I am not buying it. <BR> <BR>This is becoming an argument on what makes a good  <BR>website which is fine by me. I feel that the CD List makes us  <BR>more accessible to all ranchers. I think it keeps them  <BR>around and more likely to learn more about MR. I think it  <BR>makes good content, and to get rid of it would leave a big  <BR>gaping hole that would need to be filled. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think MRM needs to concern ourselves with how  <BR>amateurish it looks, because umm if you hadn&#39;t noticed this  <BR>is a game PT. Last I checked, Lisa wasn&#39;t sending out check  <BR>every week so we can safely say we are amateurs. <BR> <BR>I think I can safely say that MRM is a site about all aspects  <BR>of a game. Generation by CD is something that people put  <BR>a lot of research into. I can&#39;t see how it makes sense to  <BR>have all our advanced info about CD creation, without a CD  <BR>list to build upon. Someone who knows nothing of the  <BR>process can post a CD in the archive. Then someone who  <BR>knows and cares about burning CDs can find a copy of that  <BR>disc, post the subcode info and the MR community  <BR>benefits. <BR> <BR>I also think you have ignored one simple and important  <BR>fact. There are a lot of people who set themselves the goal  <BR>of getting every monster. The CD list is quite helpful in that  <BR>pursuit.

 actually this is a good discussion. <BR> <BR>i am in total agreement with pt that a cd list is useless.  since mr3, i don&#39;t keep them myself.  in mr4, i don&#39;t need one.  i shrined a bunch of discs in my first day, to learn breeds and breed name for building of the board.  i don&#39;t even play that save; i play a different one with very few monsters entered. <BR> <BR>at the same time, i would find it hard to believe that a full-service mr site would ever eliminate a cd list.  too many people still enjoy - almost as a game in itself - what discs make what monsters.  in every mr game, about 25-50% of the breed/subbreed possibilities are not rare, but don&#39;t come on all that many discs.   <BR> <BR>remember the search for the cowbird.  those lists helped new searchers with a basic text of what not to search.  it also gave them a place to record interesting results, in sections where not many entries existed. <BR> <BR>so i never use them - i don&#39;t even post in them, cuz no one else would ever encounter the music i like.  but i vote they stay.

 I&#39;m also agreeing with PT on this. I think the CD list for the most part. The only section that even interests me is the rares section. In MR4 and MR3 you can get all the non rare monsters in game and it&#39;s looking like you can get ALL the monsters in MR4. Then again there might be a few people who would want to go out and buy certain Cd&#39;s just for that one rare of theres. Personally if I have the disc that makes the rare, Good. If I don&#39;t, It&#39;s not gonna affect my gameplay. Nyaao.

 OK, I&#39;m home now and can elaborate my answer. I&#39;m not sure how this post will work out yet, but I apologize in advance if it feels like I am belittling some people. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s start by describing one of my daily visits on Gamefaqs. I see a post entitled &#34;Oh my god...&#34;. Against my better judgement, I will sometimes click on it. And as I expected, it reads as something like this:&#34;...have you seen that monster in c-class he&#39;s so cool where can i find it!!!&#34;. My reply, almost never posted, is:&#34;Shrine some disks or play the game you idiot&#34;. I could, like many people do, tell him he should look at MRM&#39;s disk list. But I fear both answers will bring the same results. He will be out there shrining disks until he finds that monster. A great help we&#39;ve been. All we accomplished is we now have a new probably very unwanted member.  <BR> <BR>The ONLY way we can help people find the monsters they absolutly want &#40;and it is beyond me why people would actively search out a monster&#41; is with the subcodes. Seriously, you can&#39;t buy a computer without a burner anymore. And for those who aren&#39;t planning to get one soon, if they&#39;re willing to go out hunting for a disk &#40;buying, renting, bothering friends and familly to see if they have it&#41;, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re willing to find someone with a burner that could do it for them. The subcodes for the ? subs and 1 of each main breed is enough to get all of the monsters. <BR> <BR>Some people who posted in here wrote it helped them. How? King952 and Tristan Ferris said they MIGHT use it. CHB said he used it to see if his collection had a Raiden, he would have found it eventually. Lao seems to have used it to hunt but is unspecific, but I&#39;m sure subcodes would have been more useful. Hawkmoon&#39;s post is just so wrong... looking in the cd list and go hunting is the slowest way you could ever get a monster. If you have it on disk or found it on adventure, it&#39;s in your book. If not, get 2 monsters from your book and combine. Worst to come, burn.

 My point boils to this topic arising again down the line. As I said before, new CDs and DVDs come out every day, and yes, many new ranchers can post in the CD list to feel &#39;helpful&#39; to the community, after they do that, and run out of CDs, they generally disappear, never to post again. Why? Because thats all they got to connect them to here, that is the only thing they can relate to. To have someone stay, they must be willing to do something that requires time, like a research, or fanfic, or something else to hold them here, something to put effort into, something to be proud of. Not just posting all of their CDs. Of course, its a great way to start, but not a way to hook people into wanting to stay. That is participation in greater things. <BR> <BR>I understand the outreach part of this, which is why I would say that the rare list does stay. As I said, I hunted down a Raiden, because I unlocked it, I worked for it. I also went through my entire DVD collection that weekend, so it really wouldn&#39;t have mattered in the end, as PT said. However, had it still been locked, THEN I would have been curious as to the contents. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not certain how many people would go out and rent something for the monster it would shrine, if not for the item itself, but I understand some do. But I also understand quantities and surplus, which is what the CD list will be eventually. I&#39;m not sure how much bandwidth this site holds, but the CD list is the thing growing largest, fastest, with little to no deletion. Eventually, this site will be one big CD list, unless topics are locked, or deleted. One of the two, but I have to agree with PT in that something needs to be accomplished. <BR> <BR>One exception, sub breeds don&#39;t transfer in MR4 like they did in MR2. This list might need some work, since primary breeds will be a lot harder to come by. Combining is still achievable, though, and thus other monsters can be added to your encyclopedia. <BR> <BR>Lastly, I&#39;d like to thank everyone for their undaunted maturity on this topic. I&#39;m very grateful. <BR> <BR>With that said, I&#39;m not an amateur. I&#39;m a Master.

 So what is wrong with my post exactly Petit-Trot? Wanting to play a specific creature? I realize it&#39;s beyond you, but I like the way certain creatures look. Was the part about getting to know people wrong? After what you wrote I&#39;m thinking I was wrong, there are some people I don&#39;t want to get to know. And what&#39;s this about sub-codes and CD burners? Some of us poor, ignorant, slow people don&#39;t know and have to go the slow way.

Why? Myself and many others don&#39;t just shrine our own CD&#39;s. We shrine our friends, familys, and other peoples discs. Oh, what&#39;s that? Yah, there&#39;s also people that can&#39;t be &#34;categorized&#34; by the music they listen to/Movies they watch/Games they play like you seem to think Hawkmoon. <BR> <BR>I propose that, the CD list, excluding rares&#40;including those with extra techs/lifespan &#91;MR2 Worm&#93;&#41; and locked breeds, is useless.

 Couple things: <BR> <BR>PT sort of asked me to be more specific. I checked the list daily to watch for Phoenix discs, until I found one on expedition. I used the list to get a Jell off a disc that was already in my &#40;wife&#39;s&#41; collection. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not shrining. I&#39;m just not marathon shrining. I go through about 15-20 every time a new ranch spot opens. Which isn&#39;t often. <BR> <BR>In my mind, the &#34;You should have a CD burner&#34; argument is kind of snobbish. Many players have older computers. Many players are children. Many players don&#39;t have the resources, whether you&#39;re talking about time, money, or whatever, to get ahold of a computer with a CD burner and blank CDs. This doesn&#39;t make them lazy or amateurish. <BR> <BR>Also, about the non-ranch/breeder improvement: Getting a Jell most certainly helped to improve my ranch. Among other things, it enabled me to fully clear Kawrea &#40;Flight/Power/All searches&#41;--more money for more foods/items/gadget switches. More chances for Stones, Tablets, and Combo items. Was it the only way to get this done? No. I could have waited for a Jell or Dukken stone. But sometimes all the patience in the world doesn&#39;t win you what you&#39;re looking for. &#40;Ask me about the Wind Drum that I still don&#39;t have, after dozens of expeditions.&#41; Is it somehow &#34;professional&#34; to refuse to use a CD list to get the monster I need, just because there&#39;s another way to get it, in the game? <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s another example: Suppose I&#39;m tricking out my ranch to have a number of different-level gadgets to handle my monsters at different ages. It&#39;s strongly to my advantage to reduce the number of skills that I&#39;m developing. Of course, certain monsters lend themselves to this streamlining. Suppose I want to cut Int entirely off the ranch? This will strongly influence my choices from each of the Power and Flight groups. For instance, for flight monsters, there&#39;s no way I want a Phoenix. I could go for a Dragon, but a Beaclon would probably be best. &#40;Funny story. I have 4 Beaclons in book. 2 from shrining. 2 from combination. 0 from adventure stones.&#41; For the Power group, I probably want a Golem. In fact, if I play my cards right, I can cut Speed and Int out, which allows me to focus my gadgets even more affectively. Suddenly, the choise of which breed to ranch isn&#39;t necessarily a matter of personal preference, but of ranch efficiency and effectiveness. <BR> <BR>So ironically, in the game where the CD list is arguably the most obsolete, using specific breeds strategically is arguably more important than ever--which may make the CD list more important than ever. <BR> <BR>Anyway, so, yeah, and stuff.

 It seems a lot of known folks are posting here, so why  <BR>shouldn&#39;t I? <BR> <BR>In a nutshell:  a CD/DVD database is invaluable.  Not  <BR>everyone is going to be able to create CDs to get that one  <BR>monster they want.  &#40;Having pioneered the research, I can  <BR>assure you of that&#41;.  It&#39;s usually easier to say, &#34;Hey, I have  <BR>that CD / My buddy has that CD / I think I can get that at  <BR>my used music store!&#34; than to set up CopyCD.   <BR> <BR>Me:  I&#39;m a casual player.  I find that one subbreed, and I  <BR>want to play it.  I don&#39;t care if it gets killed in battle and  <BR>never leaves E class.  As long as I can explore it, get a feel  <BR>for raising it, I&#39;m cool.  And usually it&#39;s easier for me to  <BR>browse a CD DB and find it than to burn my own.   <BR>ESPECIALLY considering how much more diversified MR4 is  <BR>now with its shrining.   <BR> <BR>&#40;Ironically enough, that&#39;s why I stopped by tonight--to find  <BR>a CD/DVD to catch a critter I haven&#39;t shrined yet&#41; <BR> <BR>Kalach:  What&#39;s to stop you from hosting a database  <BR>yourself?  For all the reasons Lisa listed above &#40;and probably  <BR>more some&#41;, I haven&#39;t.  Yes, I could whip together a quick  <BR>FileMaker DB and host a site.  &#40;It doesn&#39;t take a software  <BR>developer to do so.&#41;  Why haven&#39;t I?  Let&#39;s start by asking  <BR>folks when they last saw me...  But anyway, there&#39;s no rules  <BR>to keep you from hosting yours independently.  There&#39;s  <BR>more than one MR site in existance, and certainly more than  <BR>one CD/DVD DB.  In this field, the more the merrier. <BR> <BR>--Cats, ever neverbeing. <BR> <BR>ps:  Doc Shock:  if I don&#39;t see you soon, I need to thank  <BR>you--it&#39;s a long story, and the reason you haven&#39;t seen me  <BR>in the last week or two--but I really can&#39;t thank you  <BR>enough!

 Okay, I have no idea what you meant by &#34;Where you think along those lines&#34;. You say it helps you learn things about people...sure, but only a bit...maybe. What I meant by &#34;categorize&#34; is to put into a category of place in society...you know, teenager, drug user&#40;some people are&#41;, etc. Or, it could mean &#34;Oh this person must be very quiet&#34;, when in reality, that person may be very loud. What I basically said there is that just because you know what music they listen to, doesn&#39;t mean you know anything about them. <BR> <BR>I have nothing against going through CD/DVD&#39;s, and never said I did, actually, if you read point 2&#40;wow, reading, what a new concept&#41;, I actually suggest that maybe, just maybe, you&#39;ll want to go through your own CD/DVD&#39;s eventually. I do that very thing myself. It&#39;s just that from my point of view, the list at MRM serves no purpose. <BR> <BR>I posted here to state my opinion, not to get flamed. The only reason why I even mentioned what you said is because I found it, along with your other posts here, offensive. I really can&#39;t stand it when people assume they know someone without actually talking to them, at least in chat or something. I, along with others, simply stated my opinion, which I am entitled to. You basically shot it down, and continued to babble on saying I said things I didn&#39;t, and judged me by one post. As well, you said other rude things to other people without being provoked, so you, my treacherous friend, are the one who is being snobbish.

No need for me to beat this dead horse with more topics on why I think it should, because their is PLENTY of good and well written opinions here. <BR> <BR>Now, if it comes to pass. Great. <BR> <BR>If it stays forever. Great. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know how much more could even be thrown on this topic, almost every view has been posted, if not posted two or three times. Maybe when I get a good nights rest, I&#39;ll think of something, or maybe not. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to publicly thank otheous for his email. No, I do not harbor ill feelings, and rarely ever do. I cannot praise your charactor enough for shooting me an email apology, with good tidings and wishes for the future. You, my friend, are quiet awesome. Once again, I thank you, that really made my day.

 Ok, this is starting to degenerate to a flame war. It&#39;s now up to the mods to decide. Locking.
