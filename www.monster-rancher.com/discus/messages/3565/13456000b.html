<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF=mailto:danieltigerclaw@yahoo.com>Ito Saith Webb</A></B> on <B>Saturday, April 22, 2006 - 04:10 pm</B>:</FONT><P>
 First let me start off by saying hello to every one on the board as this is my first topic to the board. <BR> <BR>Anyway, since playing Monster Rancher Evo it has sparked off old ideas I had a long time ago but now remembered. Here is my idea your main character would start off with an abandoned warehouse as a ranch. In this room the character has to start off with a Gerry Rigged training course that the monster has to run through, however here is the catch it would be interactive like the show time of Monster Rancher Evo.  <BR> <BR>How the warehouse works: <BR> <BR>1&#41; The player would have to control the speed and frequency of the obstacles, traps and other devices that affect the monster each day of the week. <BR> <BR>2&#41; The player has to learn a new born&#39;s total capabilities so that he/she does not overwork or under work the monster. <BR> <BR>2a&#41; Over working the monster can lead to high stats but do it to often during the week and it could get injured. <BR> <BR>2a&#41; Under working the monster could lead to little or no stat change and may make the monster lazy. <BR> <BR>Example of a Course: Your monster runs down the course you hit X and a 10 lb sand bag drops on the monster which it catches to protect it self. If it is successful this adds to the monster&#39;s strength. Further down the course the monster has to make it&#39;s way across a spinning disk or tread mill which you control the speed by pressing X. If it is successful it gains speed. This continues for five 30 to 60 second session with each session counting as one day. The weekend is for eating, praise and such. <BR> <BR>As you get more money in the game you can improve both the training gadgets and the warehouse which helps improve the monster&#39;s health and increases from better equipment. Improvements to the warehouse could be like extra rooms for multiple monsters but I think no more than three would be ideal. <BR> <BR>Anyway the whole premise is that you control the training style for the monster manually instead of a setting. Which takes on a element from the mini-games of Evo but makes more sense IMHO. I will admit I had the idea from the Danger room of the X-Men but we don&#39;t have to call it that and it could be made different enough so that it avoids and unpleasantness from Marvel.
