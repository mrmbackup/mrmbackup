 In the &#39;suggestions for MR4&#39; thread, a couple people noticed I was back and someone asked who I am.  I thought, to waste some time, I&#39;d give a little history of myself and how I happened upon the MR community.  I&#39;m not doing much editing here so I apologize for the typos - I type fast. <BR> <BR>Shortly after Monster Rancher was released, I happened to see it on a store shelf, and it piqued my interest.  I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to make of it, and didn&#39;t buy it right away... I bought some other crappy game, returned it later that day and picked up MR instead.  Excited to see what kinds of monsters I could unlock, I tried a few and... kept getting Rovers &#40;I think that&#39;s what the Tiger/Hares were called, right?&#41;.  I called Tecmo support, no help.  I tried dozens of CDs, nothing.  So I turned to my PC and looked for Monster Rancher. <BR> <BR>I happened upon the old Greenspun LUSENET board.  It&#39;s still around for anyone who wants a peek into the past.  I should probably also mention that I figured out how to get to the moderator functions of that board by modifying the URL of the moderator functions of my board on the same server, but I&#39;m getting ahead of myself... I managed to find the solution to my dilemma in a message posted by toothpik &#40;anyone remember him?&#41;.  The button that signaled my PSX that the lid was open was stuck down, so the game never thought I put another CD in.  Easily fixed by taking the PSX apart. <BR> <BR>By that time, I was hooked anyway.  There were lots of great people at that old board, and in amongst being addicted to other games like Gran Turismo, I was very addicted to MR.  So addicted, in fact, that at a meeting of other GT addicts, I had my PSX chipped.  This was done so that my brother, at that time living in Japan, could send me a copy of Monster Farm 2 when it was released and I could get a jump on things. <BR> <BR>I began the Monster Rancher 2 baord at Greenspun as well.  As soon as I got MF2, I was posting my finds hourly... I still remember seeing some of the monsters for the first time, and describing the &#39;Crab/Scorpion&#39; and &#39;pudding&#39; monsters.  I firmly believe that I was also the first person in the US &#40;aside from Tecmo staff&#41; to see the Durahan.  I managed to geta few things from the game before it was released as MR2, but because I cna&#39;t translate, I couldn&#39;t get much. <BR> <BR>Things went well on that board for quite a while, and it grew and grew.  As others have said, traffic was astounding.  I built a cheap and dirty website that quickly rose to 1000&#43; hits per day, mainly from people going through to the board.  The website also had my MR2 beginner&#39;s strategy guide &#40;now at Gamefaqs... Lisa, if you&#39;re reading, I&#39;d be happy to inlcude it here if you want, but it&#39;s too long to be a message&#41;, monster reviews &#40;which I personsally liked doing&#41;, and some other stuff.  Eventually, with other games taking up my time, and school and work further crowding my life, I just didn&#39;t have the time to moderate hundreds of messages a day.  Lisa was the best combination of a knowledgable and level-headed person, so at first she helped me and eventually took over all moderation duties. <BR> <BR>A little while before that, Fade, a former reular poster at the original MR board, began his own site.  We started out as friendly competition, and shared alot of tips &#40;I gave him alot of HTML tips specifically, and I still hate frames... no offense guys :&#41;, but as time wehnt on he became increasingly argumentative and offsenive.  AT one point, there were several abusive and spamming posts on the MR2 board from someone with a sprint.ca IP address... the same as Fade&#39;s.  I could never prove it was him, but i still feel that he did many destructive things against that board which may have led to it&#39;s demise. <BR> <BR>Shortly thereafter, the site was attacked, numerous times.  The Greenspun LUSENET system was very insecure, and easily broken into.  Mr Greenspun didn&#39;t seem too interested in helping, and his attitude was pretty much &#39;as long as it&#39;s not affecting my server, I don&#39;t care&#39;.  At first, it was just some threatening posts, then things started siappearing.  Of course, there wer so many messages there that we had a chance to back thing up &#40;many of those backed up messages are still here&#41;, and chnage passwords to stop the attack.  In the end, however, it just wasn&#39;t worth it, and Lisa transferred what she could over to here. <BR> <BR>Since then, I&#39;ve always been on the outskirts of the MR community.  I&#39;ve been keeping an eye oon things, and I&#39;m really impressed that Lisa and everyone else here has kept things alive.  So I say Hurrah! to you guys, for finishing what I helped to start, and I&#39;m very glad that some of you still remember me.  Keep up the good work! <BR> <BR>As for what I&#39;m doing now, the GF and I are planning on moving into our own aparment in a couple months, and I need to get a new car soon as well, so money&#39;s pretty tight.  I&#39;ve been toying with MR2 again, as well as NetMonster &#40;can&#39;t wait for 2.0&#41;.  I am getting a $500 tax refund, so maybe it&#39;s time to gte a PS2 and MR3... right now the only game on that system I&#39;m interested in.  a roomate of mine has a PS2, but it&#39;s just not convenienet to go into his room to play games... kinda wierd.  I think you guys should see a bit of me every now and then. <BR> <BR>Oh, and it&#39;s spelled &#39;Bennett&#39; :&#41;

 I&#39;ll try to stick around.  Right now I&#39;m playing MR2 again, and I couldn&#39;t find my old savegame so I had to start over, which means I&#39;ll be here for a while.  But I&#39;ll try to pop in every once in a while, there&#39;s alot to learn too.

 I am new &#40;respectively&#41; to the whole MR series, MR3 was the first MR i played. I quickly became very devoted and loyal to the Game, and the whole MR concept. Are there Monster Rancher Players Anonymous meetings anywhere out there? Kidding of course. I just wanted to say, that even though i didn&#39;t know of you before, B Campbell, your history with the MR series is very inspiring and compelling. I wish i could get involved in a website the way did, even just a fraction of your involvement would be great! You have quite a remarkable MR history behind you. Here&#39;s to more to come! Kudos to you!

B, If you have a Dex Drive, you can take advantage of the Game Saves that Myself and Lisa have worked to make Publicly available for Free DL and Use. <BR> <BR>Or simply enjoy unlocking all the monsters a seconds time <BR>:&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;welcome back&#34; <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Monster Fenrick</FONT>

 Fenrick, I had thought about that &#40;I do have a dex&#41;, but I like to name myself, for one, and I don&#39;t find it a bother to unlock the monsters again.  I never unlcoked Beaclon or Jill the first time around anyway &#40;well, the first couple of times&#41;.  It actually gives me something to do.  But thanks for the offer.

 Actually, we do have Gameshark codes now that allow you change the breeder name, and the monster name. Not that you&#39;d want to, just letting you know they are around.

 Yeah, I should have mentioned that I&#39;d heard about those too, but I&#39;m morally opposed to gamesharks.  I could do it with the Dexdrive and a hex editor in any case.  Still, I like playing the game, so it&#39;s not a big deal... now if I can just find a Cd with a Worm on it...

 We&#39;ve got Worm in the Lab..... <BR> <BR>Actually, Wherehouse stores are running a clearance sale on used CDs 3 for $5. I just got a CD single with Flower Worm on it there the other day.

 Yeah, I checked out the Cd list, and there was nothing, so I ended up grabbing that worm.  It&#39;s pretty good considering it likes Rest and Cup Jellies.  Makes it pretty good for beaclon getting, which I&#39;m trying right now. <BR> <BR>I did also notice that quite a few of the Worms in the list are from singles or from PSX games.  I doubt it&#39;s a coincidence.
