 Monsters blocking rather than just dodging.  <BR> <BR>How many CD&#39;s actually WORKED! <BR> <BR>No skill!!! O.o <BR> <BR>The level of maturity your monster gets. My baby beaklon, when fed something he wasn&#39;t thrilled about eating, usually wouldn&#39;t react. Fleria would say &#34;It looks like he doesn&#39;t care.&#34; But after he grew up twice, if I fed him something with, say, two blocks in Favorite but full Nutrition she would say &#34;It looks like he understands&#34; and the big ol&#39; beetle would nod. A VERY nice touch! <BR> <BR>Everything&#39;s cute!! CUUUUUTE!!!!!!! <BR> <BR>Making monsters seems to take longer than in MR2. Lots lomger.

 I&#39;m still just trying to figure how how they pulled off making the monsters more cartoony and cute, and yet more 3D and &#34;realistic&#34; both at the same time...

 The most suprising thing to me so far would be how it is very easy &#40;at least for me&#41; to keep your monsters loyalty maxed. Mine maxed early on and has never gone down at all &#40;3 years at least&#41;.

 I was surprised most when my Rivals continually entered the same tounries I was in, and seemed to have equal monsters regardless what my training style was.  Now, I just kick their arse, but a few days ago, I was climbing the walls in rage of always being forced to battle.  I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d EVER get started, much less make Master by year 1007! hehhe <BR> <BR>...I take that back...What shocked me MOST about the game was when I learned the hard way that soft resets do JACK for failed drills.  I yelled at my first Raiden until my throat was sore, and just about had a brain hemerage when I found out that there&#39;s no way to prevent a fail other than resting.  The whole concept of programming &#34;flags&#34; were so basic to me that I couldn&#39;t see it ever being used in such a complex masterpiece.

 I think this game HAS turned out much easier than I had expected at the beginning excepting how many cd&#39;s you have to get to try and raise all the monsters. I would realy like to see what anybody think should be the highest on stats like power defence speed intelligence or life! <BR>I realy havent bothered to read the book becuase i usally like to figure out my own strategies but I thought it would be nice to have someone else&#39;s input so please post it THANKS!

 there is a lot of strategic advice - some of it contradictory - in the mr3 section.  i pretty much decide whether the monster i am raising will be pow or int, then i raise that stat, and spd, as high as i can, before working on lif and def.  i tried raising the other attribute &#91;pow in an int monster or vice versa&#93; instead of def a few times and it didnt work as well.

 Not getting flamed from having cel-shading, like Zelda: The Wind Waker. <BR> <BR>Lol, Seriously, I was surpirsed at it&#39;s utter easiness. I mean, I can HARDLY get past C-B Class in MR2, but in MR3, I can gte into A Class in, like, 30 Mins.

 Yeah, I agree about the easiness. I mean, just for fun I raised a monster &#40;with a heart&#41; so that he entered the official tourneys on the first four weeks of his life, kinda like DMM.. and he won all of them! I had an &#34;A&#34; rank monster at 1/12 of a year. Crazy. <BR> <BR>Beyond what everyone else has said, I&#39;m surprised and kinda disguisted at the shrinking lifespans and also how little training style affects lifespan.. that is, a monster who never reaches &#34;little tired&#34; won&#39;t live substantially longer than a monster who is constantly stressed and fatigued. <BR> <BR>I also love the idea of accessories. Almost every monster I raise has one or two. Now, if only there was some idea as to what effects they had, if any... same could be said for the new concept of characteristics, too. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s that.

 What they did to Nagas. I mean, jeeze, what were they thinking? The upper halfs of them are adult, but the bottom halves are like... chibi. It was surprising in a nightmare sort of way.

 1. New monsters.  Most of them are awesome, especially Zans, Raidens, and the Beaklon/Brilla - Avalanche and the Hengar/Brilla - Metanix. <BR>2. The fact that most of the monsters are cute. <BR>3. Blocking. <BR>4. The easiness!  I&#39;m not an expert MR3 player, but I am very good at making choices on which monster to use, so most of my monsters at Rank E &#40;I accidently deleted my old file, in which they were all C or above, and now my game freezes whenever I go to a tournament, so I need a new disc before I can play again&#41; can crush most other Rank E monsters in two or three hits.

 The suprise for me is that naga&#39;s are so easy to get. &#40;i have 25 discs out of 40 that have nagas on them&#41; and how effective they are. i beat the game in 3 days of playing it. my first naga got to rank B and i only had him fight once a year. and raidens arent really that good i found, they look sorta like the phoenix except it has hands and looks like a human, but has poor moves to it. its the second hardest  found to raise, dragon was the hardest because my method is to use a monsters best stats and raise them high, and either max speed or defense in te second gen! but the biggest suprise is that my normal hengar &#40;takrama&#41; beat a secret hengar boss in 1 hitt!!!!! with beam even! that was funny, and his intelligece was like 400.

 Cell.  Shaded.  Graphics.  End of story. <BR> <BR>Also, the ease of the game was a relief...when I feel like I&#39;m gonna hurl a brick at the screen in 1, 2, 4, or EVO, I pull out MR3.  It&#39;s a relief to walk into the arena and kick Ragnarox&#39;s ugly little...nevermind.  Point is, the ease of it is a huge relief, for my sanity if nothing else.
