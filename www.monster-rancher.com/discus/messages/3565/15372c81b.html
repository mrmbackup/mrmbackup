 It would have had to have been made with the 3DS technology for that to work. What nintendo is saying right now is that you won&#39;t need any special glasses for the 3DS and the technology used in the games will create the effects, perhaps scewed perspective? <BR> <BR>Anyway I highly doubt that old games will automatically go into 3D without a major overhaul. <BR> <BR>Right now I&#39;m hoping that the translation aspect was already mostly done and now all UFO has to do is print and distribute.

 The article says MRDS was completely done, so why are they delaying it? I understand rights issues and all that, but it just makes no sense to delay a game that&#39;s all prepared for launch. And is the delay accompanied by a set date? I didn&#39;t see one in my glance-over. Also, the fact that it&#39;s ANOTHER Monster Rancher game, Monster Racer maybe won&#39;t be so bad. I avoided Hop-a-bout for years &#40;until recently, in fact&#41; but when I played it, I fell in love with it. So, this isn&#39;t all bad news, right?

 I can only think it might be to avoid competition with Pokemon, which while disappointing I can understand. <BR> <BR>I still have hopes for MR to become more popular, but people are going to go for a series they are familiar with then a new one if presented with both at the same time. <BR> <BR>Monster Racer involves Monster Rancher? I&#39;ll give it a shot. &#40;I own hop-a-bout but I&#39;ve never played it. &#62;.&#62; &#41;

 I hate to bring bad news, but Monster Racer has -NOTHING- to do with Monster Rancher. I did a quick check on Youtube &#40;since it was unveiled sometime during the previous E3&#41; and the only thing they share in common is the word &#34;Monster&#34; from what the trailer showed. The monster design is more in line with Pokemon or Shin Megami Tensei, and the sound effects more akin to the former. There&#39;s even a video showing the entire species library and nothing from our beloved monster world. Speaking of worlds, the setting for the game is the real-world Earth and not the fictional regions either.

 I still can not get a date for it form GameStop and I make a habit of asking in everyone in driving distance.  A few of the employees were not even aware of the game but seemed fairly well excited about it and one of them even said it was always a great series and he was really glad to hear they are continuing it.  Lets spread the word that the game is coming out!

 Gamestop gets their dates via the order process, when their buyers write a PO for the item, the publisher gives them a ship date, and updated info if that changes. That&#39;s why their dates are better.

 If it means anything, which I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t, I checked the Gamestop system in Canada for MR DS and it says mid May which is a month away, but I doubt it...

 I&#39;m extremely concerned with how well MR:DS is going to do sales-wise.  Looking at the MR:DS facebook page, it only has 287 fans, whereas the Earthbound facebook page &#40;a good comparison since it&#39;s also an underrated game with a small cult following&#41; has over 8000.  I imagine that the number of people who are going to buy MR:DS is going to be higher than 287, but my point is that the game won&#39;t sell well, as Monster Rancher is far from the most popular franchise nowadays.  Even little kids aren&#39;t attracted to it since the show doesn&#39;t play on TV anymore.  In other words: the game is screwed because virtually no one will hear or care about it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll still buy it, and maybe I&#39;ll even get some of my nerdy friends with DS&#39;s to buy a copy, but let&#39;s face it: Monster Rancher appeals to a very small demographic, because on the surface it seems too immature and &#34;kiddy&#34; for adults, but in terms of gameplay it&#39;s too complex for most kids.

 It&#39;s not even remotely realistic to compare sales with facebook fans.  I really don&#39;t even know why you would try. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not a facebook fan, so am I not going to buy the game?  You better believe I am going to.  However, I do not have a facebook account nor do I wish to ever have one.

 If you take the proportion of sales of a game to the number of fans on its facebook page, they&#39;ll be roughly equal among most games.  I never made any silly generalizations like &#34;# of fans on facebook page = # of sales&#34;, nor did I say that not being a fan on facebook precluded the possibility of you buying the game

 This is an easily testable hypothesis.  I predict Monster Rancher DS will sell between 4000 and 5000 copies &#40;this isn&#39;t a random number but the result of a simple calculation&#41;.  If I&#39;m wrong, you win.

 Earthbound has been around since the 90&#39;s... <BR>Monster Rancher is a niche game. <BR>Facebook fans mean absolutely nothing to anyone... <BR>4-5k games sold is an absurdly low number, and is just laughable. <BR>If a game only sold 5000 copies, that series would end right there and never be picked up again. <BR> <BR>To make my point clear: You&#39;re wrong TracedInAir. <BR> <BR>And as for a release date: Guys, just wait until the new publisher releases one. There&#39;s no point in waiting for GameStop to give you a guesstimated date... I thought you guys learned your lesson the first time, when it wasn&#39;t released in March/April? Tsk Tsk.

 Well my point of asking at gamestop isn&#39;t so much to get an actual date as I already know they don&#39;t have one.  It&#39;s to keep the name of the game in the employees minds and or make them aware that the game is even coming out.  The more they are aware of a game the more likely they are to recommend it or even pick it up themselves.
