 I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a tourney to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first MR game?  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know details about times for the event, it is a ways off in the future, but I was thinking about setting up the guidelines for entry so people could start working on their monsters. Anyone interested?

 even though i dont have MR1, and if it did have a PAL version, i wouldnt be able to enter anyway, I still think that this would be a cool idea. <BR> <BR>the big problem is that there are not that many people that frequent the site anymore.

<I>&#34;the big problem is that there are not that many people that frequent the site anymore.&#34;</I> <BR> <BR>Here there be lurkers. <BR> <BR>Honestly, for November, I&#39;d not just be able to raise a monster...I&#39;d be able to beat the game. Something I still need to do. I just sort of bought MR1 and stored it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to see who&#39;s interested in the idea, Lisa, but I assure you I&#39;d be ready to raise one &#40;and probably game provided I had at least one opponent&#41;.

 I&#39;m not really good at tournys, least I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be. I&#39;m not &#34;hardcore&#34; enough xD Hope everyone else has fun, and happy 10th MR series! ^^

 Well, Infernus, If you think you&#39;re up to it, I will probably raise one. I am still thinking about my loss in legendcup&#39;s MR1 Master&#39;s, and think I could make a better monster. <BR> <BR>For those who haven&#39;t played the first game, you really should try it!  <BR> <BR>In some ways, it&#39;s a lot easier &#40;you can feed infinite items per week&#41; but in others it presents unique challenges. It&#39;s definitely the least &#39;cute&#39; game in the series, and has a more anime feel to it.  <BR> <BR>I also like the music the best of all the games in the series. <BR> <BR>If enough people enter, I will establish classes, like at legendcup. If it&#39;s just a few, then it&#39;s a free-for-all, so be prepared to face maxxed monsters.

<I>and has a more anime feel to it. </I> <BR> <BR>What are you talking about!?  The first MR game is <B>no where</B> near an anime compared to the abortions that are MR4 and EVO.  EVO was literally a 101 on how to make a really bad anime, and turn it into a hideous JRPG.  MR4 was just...well, words fail me for 4.

 I was refrring to the animations when the monsters work. They have sweatbeads on the sides of their faces, etc., like old style anime.

 So, some basic rules for those planning monsters: <BR> <BR>Any type of monster is fine. <BR> <BR>No gameshark use, except for codes to get cash. <BR> <BR>You will be expected to submit saves via dex drive save, to my email address. <BR> <BR>No emulator use, must be on a console.

<I>No gameshark use, except for codes to get cash.</I> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not that hard to make cash if you follow the trick I posted a while back; time consuming especially if your critter gets lost, but definitely not hard &#40;If you&#39;re too lazy to go to thread, go to the misc. MR1 thread unless it was deleted&#41;.

 Apparently it was deleted, so I&#39;ll just quickly sum it up: Take an Int. Monster, get it C class, and just raise Intelligence to 999, and go to the very first temple you see in the July Expedition &#40;Get one with a long life span like Gali&#41;.  Depending on your luck you can make $40,000&#43; from diamonds, gold bars, and whatever else is in that temple.

 I&#39;ve only posted on here one time before in the years I&#39;ve been coming to this site.  I mainly like just reading it....but this sounds great and I would be interested.  No dex drive, by the way where can you still get one?, but it&#39;d be no problem to mail a memory card.  Is November what you&#39;re thinking?  I have family so that would be ample enough time to raise a hopefully competetive monster.

 November would be the time, mailing a memory card is fine, I will return it. Dex&#39;s show up on Ebay occasionally, just make sure to get the Playstation version, not the N64 one. Also, if you do get one look around for better upgrade software for it. The floppies that come with it have some pretty bad software. Interact published two upgrades for it, but they closed their website. There&#39;s also a good homebrew version called Dexter, search around, you&#39;ll find it.

 You&#39;d send it to me. The address is in the Office of the Mayor, in the Parental Consent form for those under age 13. <BR> <BR>I strongly suggest that anyone sending in a card make sure to wrap it well in bubble wrap, and maybe put it in a small box, just so it doesn&#39;t get crushed.
