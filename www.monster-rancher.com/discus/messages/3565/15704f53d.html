 5 console games and 2 portable games became 1 portable game and 1 phone game in the next generation &#40;US-wise, anyway--but Japan&#39;s numbers weren&#39;t that much better, with only 1 more portable game&#41;.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a shame because I know people would love this series if it became a Vita port--like what happened with Tactics Ogre, part of my other favorite series of games. It had 4 games that no one in the States knew or cared about with crap sales, but a PSP port was incredibly successful even in the last hours of the PSP&#39;s life. <BR> <BR>I wish this series could be treated with the same fate. Heck, it wasn&#39;t very hard for them to import a lot of the same animations from MR4 to MRDS, was it? I want to see them do it again for a downloadable-port, or a Vita port...of course, the ultimate holy grail would be a full console sequel but that dream is all but given up.

 I have to agree. It&#39;s still one of my favorite  <BR>series, but I personally feel that they lost touch  <BR>with it after MR2. They just kept trying to add  <BR>more or make themselves stand out more or try to  <BR>market to a different crowd...and it always seemed  <BR>to backfire. &#40;In my eyes anyway&#41; <BR> <BR>They were so close with the DS game, and I would  <BR>still be playing it to this day...if not for the  <BR>battles. Making even the most basic moves cost a  <BR>ridiculous amount of points made it go by at a  <BR>snails pace, and I eventually just said NOPE! <BR> <BR>I would love for them to make another game,  <BR>especially a full console release. I think that  <BR>online multiplayer would fit this game like a  <BR>glove and really give it some legs and increase  <BR>sales. But I would really hope they go back to  <BR>what made 1 and 2 great if they decided to take  <BR>another chance and give the series another go.

 MRDS was pretty solid but it was lame as hell that there was no wifi.  Plus I hated how the save-scum punishing system. <BR> <BR>We need a 3DS game, tbh.

 I have to say, Ogre Battle was one of my favorite SNES games.  I used to play the crap out of it.  Monster Ranger was definitly one of my favorite PSOne/PS2 series.  As with most people I agree that MR2 was the best of the series but I did enjoy 3 and 4 &#40;and obviously 1&#41; quite a bit.  I even enjoyed the DS version though not as much.  The GBA version I wasn&#39;t overly keen on and 5 well..... <BR> <BR>Anyway I would love to see this game on the PSOne classics in the Playstation Store.  I am amazed that 2 isn&#39;t on there.

 Oh yes, don&#39;t get me wrong. I played the heck out  <BR>of MR3, 4, Circus, the GBA games, and DS. <BR> <BR>But none of them had the staying power of MR1 or  <BR>MR2. They were simple to play, difficult to  <BR>master, and beautiful in how much was hidden. Not  <BR>to mention the awesome little details here and  <BR>there.  <BR> <BR>My favorite thing in the whole series in something  <BR>that was only in MR1, and that was watching the  <BR>monsters bodies change from when they were young  <BR>to when they were full grown. Little Suezo losing  <BR>their flippers, Worms body getting fuller, or a  <BR>Tiger sub breed beginning to sprout it&#39;s horn. It  <BR>amazed me as a kid, and I still find it to be one  <BR>of the greatest touches put on any game ever. <BR> <BR>I played MR1 exclusively until MR2 came out, and  <BR>then played that for a really long time as well. I  <BR>don&#39;t think any game has captured my attention  <BR>like those. It would just be awesome to see  <BR>something like that again. <BR> <BR>Heck, give me MR1 or MR2 with an added online  <BR>battle system and I&#39;d pay a full $60 for it again.  <BR>:P

 I have to agree. This series is still one of my  <BR>favorites ever. Even though they were released some  <BR>time ago, I find myself playing at least one version  <BR>of the series daily. They just amaze me, and I wish  <BR>more people could come and enjoy the greatness of  <BR>this series. A worthy sequel could help grab  <BR>attention,if they have a lot of the mechanics from 1  <BR>and 2 that made them so great, and expand more with  <BR>technology we have today.

 I honestly think that the demand could be there. Pokemon is still a largely played game with a similar idea behind it, though we all know that there are a lot of differences. <BR> <BR>There have been a few other attempts at the monster battle/raising genre as well. The Fossil Fighter Series and Invizimals are the first to pop into my mind. Sure neither of these have done great nor have they broken into a household name, but they were able to create sequels. Oh, Dragon Quest Monster as well. <BR> <BR>Of course most of these games rely on questing and battles to raise your monsters, to some extent, and I would not suggest MR going in this direction. But what it does show is that there is some demand out there. It may not be huge, but its there. And when it comes down to it MR doesn&#39;t need to be a huge high end game, it just has to have quality, such as the 1 and 2.  <BR> <BR>I think that the series had lost a bit of qaulity along the way and they made trade offs of core systems to try and implement things to appeal to a larger audience. Not a bad idea if you are producing a million dollar game, but a terrible risk for lesser known games. I think that a whole new generation could fall in love with the MR series again if they put out a high quality sim like MR1 and 2. Leave in some of the brutality and realness, it sets the games apart from the cutesy super kiddish titles, and creates a bond with the franchise that lasts for years &#40;the reason why we all want another title so badly&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just ranting a bit again though because I&#39;m bored. Just hope we see something in the coming years.

 Me too...the MR2 and MR1 realness that separates it from other monster sim games it what makes the game so good. Bring it back without a number-title--so as not to scare off a new audience...even an entirely new name, like Monster Evolution, so long as the gameplay is the same as it used to be.  <BR> <BR>I guarantee you everyone on Reddit would love it--which reminds me, reddit.com/r/monsterrancher isn&#39;t exactly bustling. Should we vitalize it?

 to be honest if Koei would&#39;ve put Monster Rancher in  <BR>Conquest instead of Pokemon, no one would have  <BR>bought it.

 Monster Rancher IS my favorite games series. No doubt to me. I even took up cross-stitching to be able to make some of the sprites, and I agree that MR2 is the best. <BR> <BR>I think another problem they had was they started aiming towards a younger audience I think. And EVO they moved away even more from their own niche to more directly compete with Pokemon, and that isn&#39;t going to work great. <BR> <BR>I do hope they go back to Monster Rancher 2 type gameplay someday, but I&#39;m not going to hold my breath on that. To be honest I don&#39;t even know if there will be another. But I hope so. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately they don&#39;t even have a Monster Rancher forum on their site I think. :P <BR> <BR>Best we can do is share our joy of the game with others and have them talk about it too. Maybe if more chatter is seen on the internet they&#39;ll get more interest in making another because maybe more people will buy it.

Come to think of it, I did thought about a new Monster Rancher 3DS/PS Vita game idea with a lot of nostalgic ideas and features from the past MR games, but I don&#39;t know if this would be as good as the past games though... If anyone would like to know about this idea anyway, please contact me here: <A HREF="http://jake-mcdeen-origalis.deviantart.com/" TARGET="_top">http://jake-mcdeen-origalis.deviantart.com/</A>

 The thing that makes Monster Rancher unique from the Poke&#39;mon and Digimon games is the Lifespan. <BR> <BR>Monsters die and that&#39;s just one of the best touch to the training system. With a limited lifespan, the game has more re playability and challenge.  <BR> <BR>And this is no ordinary level up game since monsters train in order to battle; Not battle in order to be trained. <BR> <BR> <BR>Digimon world 1 actually has similar training and lifespan system.  <BR> <BR>MR2 was the best out of the series. It had great raising system, technique chain and combining system. But it lacked the adventure, plot and battle upgrades that MR4 had. The other problem is that the possibility of maxxing the stats of monsters in MR2 which is bad in the long run. In PVP battles, all 999 stats monsters is dull to watch&amp;#65279; and play with. They should apply the stats system in Monster Rancher DS where you can reach1500 but with a caps of 5994 stat points for variety.
