Truly, no topic thread in the Library could fit this topic. Just a project I wish to entertain myself with, and I&#39;m a sucker for challenges. <BR> <BR>The actual point of this is purely substance matter for a short fiction story. What I need, are volunteers. <BR> <BR>So, email me at: <BR> <BR><A HREF="mailto:king_usaf2003@yahoo.com">king_usaf2003@yahoo.com</A> <BR> <BR>I would say post it here, but that would take all the mystery out of it. Plus, I don&#39;t want to jumble the thread too much with long winded explanations of your characters. I just think email might be easier. <BR> <BR>In the email, include what your character&#39;s name, appearance, roughly what age they look, and any other information as to what they look like. Please make this as detailed as possible, to save me the elaboration. <BR> <BR>Be sure to add his/her personality as well, so I can get a real sense of charactor from them, as well as what they might be compelled to say and the demeanor of the monsters they would raise. <BR> <BR>Also, the monster you wish to enter the tournament. It could be rare if you like, or even a breed you design, just be sure to give me very detailed information on the beast so I may do it justice. <BR> <BR>The thing that really sets this mock tourney up, is that I will elaborate on the matches, however, the winners will be randomly selected... <BR> <BR>By nothing more than a coin flip. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll roll dice to check who fights who in the initial matches, but the victor of the tourney is totally up to chance, and I can have free reign on the matches themselves to pull any two monsters into the finals. <BR> <BR>This is all just on a whim, and I will continue with the epic I currently have going, just pausing for a community moral check, if you would. As I would call it, a squadron activity.  &#62;,o <BR> <BR>The tournament will have an undetermined amount of contestants, depends on who all wish to compete. And, if you wish to remain anonymous, that is fine. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll not point out which member created which rancher, but if you wish to reply saying &#34;You stupid CHB! You suck! You made my dude lose!&#34;, then that is entirely up to you. <BR> <BR>Doing this on a whim, just thought it would be fun. <BR> <BR>P.S. Cheating is allowed, and somewhat encouraged  &#62;:&#41;

 I have 5 now, so if I don&#39;t get one more, I&#39;ll just make up another. <BR> <BR>I must admit, some very, VERY interesting entries. Which is a good thing.

 Ok, I have 6, if you still want in, you can. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;m going to start preliminary writing this weekend, but won&#39;t set up the mock match listings until later.

 I&#39;d also like to add I am very, VERY pleased with the monsters entered... <BR> <BR>6 Zan or 6 Raiden would have upset me. Amazingly, I don&#39;t have either one currently.  :D <BR> <BR>Still, it is a pleasent diversity.
