 Allright so are there some tricky ways to reset without losing AP on a certain monster. <BR> <BR>Lets say I want to do a risky tournament with a monster, would this be a workable solution to getting around the AP issue. <BR> <BR>Freeze the monster and get a new temp monster. Then when the week of the tournament comes save the game while the temp monster is on the ranch and then load it up again. Then go back and freeze the temp monster and get out my real monster, fight him and if he loses reset. Since I didn&#39;t save with my prime monster on the farm would it still lose AP, or would my temp monster lose the AP because he is the one who would be loaded up? <BR> <BR>Also does resetting after combining damage AP to either monster? Say I wanted to see what each of the different combos would give me, well the only way to do that would be to try and then reset and try again. Would this damage my monster, or because they are both frozen would it have no effect? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just trying to get a firmer grasp on what is allowable and what isn&#39;t with this invisible AP stat.  <BR> <BR>Also life Drill in the fall is amazing! Hello &#43;650 hp and 400 Skill!

 1&#41;  This is risky, but it might be possible.  However, my experience from the game previously had been that your monster gets &#34;marked&#34; as soon as you attempt something.  Let&#39;s say I take monster to a tourney.  He is then &#34;marked&#34; &#40;on the save file&#41;.  I finish the tourney and save.  The &#39;mark&#39; is removed.  If you load a game up and a monster is &#39;marked&#39; when you do it, that monster loses AP.  In your example, the AP loss would probably hit him when he is taken from the freezer. <BR> <BR>  I could be wrong, but I think that&#39;s how it went for me before. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Unknown, but you shouldn&#39;t need to reset after combining.  You can see almost exactly what your results are gonna be before you decide.  You can reference the combo formula in MFDS2 for projections as well. <BR> <BR> And yes, that 3x3 block in the middle of the map in the Fall at Kawrea Volcano is indeed EPIC.  But do check out the Spring as well.  There is a center loop where every 3rd or 4th block has a side step to bonus rolls.

 Hmm well that stinks, I was hoping there was a loophole. Oh well, already tried it once with my latest Henger, his potential is pretty much ruined then. <BR> <BR>About how long can a monster live after he&#39;s given the &#34;old age&#34; speech. I don&#39;t care too much about combining this henger anymore since I already hit his AP for 50 points it seems, so I might as well use him to win a few high level tournaments. He just recieved the &#34;old age&#34; message though. Any idea how many battles I could get out of him if I freeze him and use Honeyshrooms?

 Hard to say, but Hengars have very high lifespans in this game. &#40;All Hengar breeds have a lifespan rating of 5 stars!!&#41;  An un-peached hengar should live around 5 years at least. <BR> <BR>Phoenix has short lifespan with a rating of 1 star on all 4 breeds.  1 star rating is about 3-3.5 years total.

 Do you think you could post how all the main breeds are ranked in lifespan Thorr? :&#41; <BR> <BR>I looked around in the Japanese archive and didnt see anything on it.,

 Main breeds have trends, but each individual monster has its own lifespan.  The best I can do is post lifespans for the Purebreeds.

 Is it like MR2 where the sub breed is a variable of the main breed? Ie base line is X weeks, and sub type modifies that to X&#43; or - Y?

 Nope. It&#39;s much more specific. <BR> <BR>For example -  <BR> <BR>  Pure Dragon - 1 Star lifespan <BR>  Pure Beaclon - 4 Stars <BR>  Pure Hengar - 5 Stars <BR> <BR>Dragon/Beaclon - 2 Stars <BR>Dragon/Hengar - 4 Stars <BR> <BR>  What I will do is post the average lifespan of each main breed in the same post with the tech charts.

 I&#39;ve been raising monsters in a method that would drop AP, but so far it seems like AP isn&#39;t very significant or maybe I&#39;ve found a way around the AP reduction. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to use a second-generation monster that I&#39;m still working on as an example. <BR> <BR>When raising his parents &#40;both from the academy&#41;, I would freeze them and quit before I entered a tournament, drill or errantry. <BR> <BR>For each parent, I probably froze and saved close to 15 times. <BR> <BR>One parent, a Durahan/Joker, was a Moon rating and the other, a Joker/Joker, was a Sun rating. <BR> <BR>Both made S class, but couldn&#39;t go any further. <BR> <BR>Their combination had a star for all six battle stats, but a triangle for lifespan. <BR> <BR>I am currently trying to beat the last of the four Kings tournaments with their offspring &#40;a Joker/Joker with double galaxy rating&#41;. <BR> <BR>Here are his current stats: <BR> <BR>Pow: 666 <BR>Int: 722 <BR>Ski: 738 <BR>Spd: 639 <BR>Def: 712 <BR>Lif: 926 <BR> <BR>He learned six techniques in his life and only has the traits &#34;Brainy,&#34; &#34;No Prob,&#34; and &#34;Spunk.&#34; <BR> <BR>Cleo told me when he was 2 years, 1 month, that it was time to freeze him. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still raising him at 2 years, 9 months, mostly by sending him to drills and tournaments. <BR> <BR>I know that this is a very small sample, but this monster and the training techniques used to build up to him suggest that either freezing and saving is a way around or AP, or maybe AP isn&#39;t as significant as suggested.

 Hmmm interesting. Kind of wish I would have kept my Henger around to experiment on instead of drugging him up to win 2 of the 4 king tournaments. :P
