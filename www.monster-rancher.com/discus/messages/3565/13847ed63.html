 The DS is region-free. The catch is, these games are VERY text-heavy so it&#39;s not an easy play unless you can read a bit of katakana.

 The flavor text is back. That&#39;s nice, I&#39;ve always enjoyed that. It  <BR>appears that the monster tally in this game will be 181, with at  <BR>least one new breed. Though that&#39;s the lowest monster count in  <BR>the series barring Monster Farm Pop, the online component  <BR>more than makes up for it for me. <BR> <BR>The playboard training option looks familiar. Didn&#39;t MFP utilize  <BR>it? <BR> <BR>The 2D/3D dual battle perspective with the commands on the  <BR>touchscreen looks very handy. And speaking of handy, I suspect  <BR>that there will be an ink limit for doodle regeneration which  <BR>increases as you go up in rank, allowing you to make more  <BR>complex drawings, and thus access to more breeds which  <BR>require them. <BR> <BR>It also appears that you may be able to watch the other  <BR>monsters battle in the tourneys, as opposed to just your own. <BR> <BR>Splendid, indeed.

 A part of me is still skeptical after playing through Evo and 4 because I really want to see new breeds than just the same olds ones from the past games &#40;I also want new models for older breeds like Joker and Mew&#41;.  It would be nice to unlock a monster that isn&#39;t: a Dragon/Joker/Zan/Durahan, something that was playable from the past 4 or 5 games &#40;Gali in MRA2, Mocchi in MR4&#42;&#41;, or something completely stupid, worthless, and ugly-looking like Maya in Evo. <BR> <BR>I can care less about which breeds return, as long as the new ones have some kind of spunk and good uniqueness about them; something I can&#39;t say for most of the new Breeds &#91;spare Raiden&#93; past MR2 &#40;Some people like Garu, Octopee, and Piroro, and some people are just stupid&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42;Seriously, whoever thought it was cool to make Mocchi unlockable deserves to lose his job because Mocchi is still an abomination after all these years &#40;I&#39;ll admitt he&#39;s more tolerable to listen to&#41;.

 I&#39;m really happy to see the Monster Rancher series continuing and not dying out like we had all worried. <BR> <BR>And this game looks awesome, to me, it looks like they are finally going back to some of the original-features of the series... <BR>but, I&#39;m not sure how it will do. <BR> <BR>It just doesn&#39;t look like it will SELL well. <BR>And I&#39;m a little worried right now about ANOTHER game not selling well.

 Super stoked for this. <BR>I don&#39;t even care if it does that well. <BR>I just want it. <BR>All DS games sell well, though. :&#41; <BR>The whole idea of being able to generate monsters from GBA carts, sounds, and drawings, is so amazingly amazing.. <BR>God, I want this.. <BR>If it doesn&#39;t come out here, I&#39;m going to become fluent in Japanese.

 personaly, i dont care if i cant understand a thing on it, i will just print myself out a translation guid for the menus and attacks. also, being able to use both the touch screen and gba carts to unlock monsters seems cool

 You don&#39;t care if it does well? <BR>Well, now I hate you. -_- &#40;Kidding&#41; <BR> <BR>Seriously though, you better care... a lot. <BR>If this game fails to sell well, two things will likely happen. <BR>1. It will not get translated. <BR>2. It will be the end of Monster Rancher, FOREVER. <BR> <BR>With the failure of MR EVO, this will likely be the end of MR as we know it unless it sells well. <BR>I highly doubt Tecmo would go through with making another MR game if none of the ones they do make will sell &#40;even though they&#39;ve been getting progressively farther away from MR&#39;s roots and it&#39;s their own fault.&#41; <BR> <BR>Since this game looks as if it is attempting to go back towards MR&#39;s roots &#40;from what I&#39;ve seen&#41;. Tecmo will have no other direction to go with the series, if it fails, even if they did decide to continue it for some reason. <BR> <BR>Personally, I don&#39;t want the series to ever end. <BR>So I wouldn&#39;t take the sales of this game too lightly. <BR>But then, most of us thought EVO was the end of the series. So we&#39;re all very lucky they are still making this one. <BR>And it does look awesome. ^-^

I sometimes wonder how you can worsen a franchise until I see how this and the Mega Man X games worsen after each game. <BR> <BR>Despite my hopes for this game to be good, I&#39;m not holding my breath after MR4 really disappointed me &#40;I had a feeling Evo was going to be bad, but words fail me for MR4&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42;Ok, maybe I would if they did that, and got rid of all the breeds from MR3, MRA2, MR4, and Evo.
