 I was watching a show on Discovery Channel, about ancient inventions. It brought up that the first inventor in Human history was likely a woman. And her invention; a sack to carry her child on her body so that she could have her hands free. Something very crucial in early human life for survival.  <BR> <BR>So basically, i wanted to know what you guys think, agree, disagree... What do you think may have been humanity&#39;s first invention?

 Disagree.  I would think the club came first.  I can&#39;t think of how she would be able to make a sack without a decent skin, which would require several previous inventions such as knives, needle, thread.

 To make a sack you don&#39;t always have to have a skin. Grasses do very well and can be woven together without the use of thread or needles. <BR> <BR>Was the first invention a sack? In my opinion no not really. But it does make sense though. However we will never really know what was the first invention. Unless of course someone goes back in time and sees what it is.

 Humans existed far before we became hunters, the earlyist humans were scavengers, and were literally, the hunted. Large cats, &#40;the name escapes me&#41; hunted early humans, and without a way for humans to run and climb they would have never gotten to a point where they could fight back. To me this means that humans had to have both hands free, and to have both hands free, you need something to carry things that would normally be carried in your hands, i.e. a baby.

 I could say spomething really bad about needing sacks to make babies but I won&#39;t.  But at least something to hunt with had to be made.  A sack wouldn&#39;t need anything extra untill they had this extra skin sitting around with no use.

 i&#39;d go for throwing rocks any day... <BR>i&#39;d have to say the first invention was digging sticks.or pointed sticks. you know for digging up grubs ect. Monkeys use those, so i dont see why early human couldnt

 no one read what i wrote at all did they... The earliest humans, were not hunters... they were scavengers &#40;not meat scavengers&#41;... and they were prey... a life which consisted of running and finding nuts and berries where they could... ah well, i did ask for your thoughts didn&#39;t i...

 Hey Shadow, how do you know I&#39;m wrong?  Anyone of us could be right, or none of us, including you.  First, you have to define invention.  I think thrown rocks came before wielded clubs, but I don&#39;t consider rocks an invention.  To me, an invention has to be something modified to suit a purpose. I would assume man modified a fallen stick before he learned to shape rock.  <BR> <BR>The sack is just too complex for me to accept it as the first invention.  I would think twine would come before weaving a full sheet of grass and turning it into a sack.  If you want to argue that weaved grass came before man cleaned up a stick or bone, I can still think of several inventions, like the blanket, that would come before a sack.  Club doesn&#39;t mean hunter, the first ones were more likely used to knock down the higher fruit and berries or to dig in the mud for tubers and grubs or even something as simple as beating a path through the brush. <BR> <BR>And for the off the wall tangent, if we used a time machine to go back before the first invention to see what is invented first, does the time machine then become the first invention?  Don&#39;t believe everything they tell you on television, much of what they quote as fact is little more than unproven theories.

 Hey, is&#39;nt like covering for the body, like cloths the first invention, cause I ca&#39;nt picture, dudes and girls running around naked just talking to each other and using pick up lines. Well, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not into history, but if this is not it, I vote for the club.

 Although it&#39;s possible that they just used huge rucks to bludgeon their prey, I would have to go with the club.

 No, I have to say that Jazz came before rock. And maybe that&#39;s the answer. We&#39;re talking about inventions, right? We know monkeys and Tropical Apes use pointed sticks, otters use rocks, etc. These are just tools. I don&#39;t think that humanity&#39;s first invention should be credited as something we could have seen apes doing. An Invention, in my opinion, is the introduction of a new element of life, a new idea. The car, the plane, the Flowbee, the open marriage, Glam rock. <BR> <BR>Now if a woman made a sack, to carry babies or nuts in, that would be an invention. But I don&#39;t think that was the FIRST human invention. I believe that was: Art/Music. <BR> <BR>Why? What did your mom do to you at night? No, not that. I mean she sand you a lullabye. Moms are always singing to their children, in every culture. So If you&#39;re willing to except the sack as a very early invention, I think music had to be even earlier.  <BR> <BR>-Dr. Dieter Von BlackArrow, PhD, MBa, DDS, Esquire

 interesting point of view, but ideas are different from inventions.  many people had the idea of a flying machine before the wright brothers were credited with inventing one.

 Hmmm... I would answer that the idea of a flying machiene and the idea of music are different, since music could be produced immediately, and the flying machiene took a lil&#39; longer... <BR> <BR>But I&#39;m going against the music idea anyway, because birds were singing before we were. So I need a new invention... Still thinking... <BR> <BR>Baskets, anyone? For carrying their nuts and berries? Sure, why not?

 Ok, I will chime in with an opinion. I know that animals can and often use rocks and sticks for a variety of food-related activities, and for defense. Those seem obvious. <BR> <BR>I would like to resister a vote for personal hygiene tools: toilet paper-like use of leaves, and sanitary napkins from moss. Both of those items could be necessary long before a baby-carrier.
