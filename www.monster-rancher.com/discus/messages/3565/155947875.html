 First off, hello! After stalking the site for years I finally decided to sign up.  <BR> <BR>Now, have you ever found yourself asking &#34;What if I saw a &#40;Insert MR monster name here&#41; in real life? I found myself pondering that the other day while doing laundry. I was thinking about it so hard that I had myself freaked out that I was going to turn around and see a huge eye ball on a tail behind me, waging it&#39;s equally large tongue around. &#40;And now I&#39;m laying off the ghost/alien TV shows for awhile.&#41; <BR> <BR>I bring this thought to you because I am curious, which monster do you think would freak you out the most if you saw it? I feel a lot of them would rip a good scream out of me only because I scare easily.  <BR>Which one would you be so excited about that the thought would hardly cross your mind that &#34;Hey, this shouldn&#39;t be here.&#34; Tiger and Zuum would be my two.  <BR> <BR>Lastly I was thinking about writing a short story about such an encounter. I noticed the stories section has been a bit dead for awhile. I won&#39;t post it till next month as I won&#39;t have time to work on it till I go on vacation at the end of this month.  <BR> <BR>Tell me what you think!

 I think that any Monol in motion would be very scary, due to the size. Jura Wall would be the worst of them for me. <BR> <BR>That said, I find Caloriena to be extremely creepy.

 I think Monol types would make good additions to haunted houses. They would guarantee people would get scared, thus getting their monies worth.

 I think Joker would be pretty terrifying, he&#39;s basically the grim reaper with a clown face.. doesn&#39;t get much creepier!

 I think the only one that wouldn&#39;t immediately freak me out would be the pixies because they are the closest thing in size and form to a non-dangerous creature in RL. &#40;ie female humans&#41; <BR> <BR>Tiger would probably be the second least but wolves aren&#39;t exactly safe. <BR> <BR>Most others I can think of at the moment are far off and would be far out of place, and couldn&#39;t be explained away with if seen with a cursory glance.. other then drugs. :P

 I agree with that Shen, I think Tecmos big goal with the monsters was to make sure the majority of them couldn&#39;t be mistaken for anything else. That and to make sure they looked ready to kick some major rear end.

 I would not want to come across a Naga... and I agree that Joker would be a bit intimidating.  I would also think there would be an eerie-ness if you came upon a Gali...of course, I have not seen the new models for these, I see all monsters in MR2 style.

 I&#39;d go with Suzuri, the forgotten bell. You always forget about it and end up killing it. <BR>Then again, Lady Gaga Suzurin would be unforgettable

 The majority of them would likely be dangerous...  unless they&#39;re the lame-<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> kind found in the anime. <BR> <BR>&#34;&#34;First off, hello! After stalking the site for years I finally decided to sign up. &#34;&#34; <BR> <BR>As opposed to me, who has had an account for years but barely visited.  Kinda wonder how old my account is.  I think I might have signed up here in 2004 or whatever. <BR> <BR>&#34;&#34;Tiger would probably be the second least but wolves aren&#39;t exactly safe.&#34;&#34; <BR> <BR>I pity the fool who mistakes a horned blue animal for a wolf.
