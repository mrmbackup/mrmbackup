 I figured I&#39;d create this things own thread so the smartphone app thread won&#39;t get hijacked even more. <BR> <BR>I was just pondering the news that Digimon Masters Online is getting an english translation and how that would affect Monster Farm Online ever coming from the US. <BR> <BR>Since I&#39;m no expert at either game &#40;even if I&#39;d try to become one if MFO got an english version&#41; I just started thinking about it from a business standpoint. <BR> <BR>So how would the success of DMO affect MFO? <BR> <BR>If DMO fails: Most likely, unless MFO somehow addressed every single problem of DMO &#40;not likely&#41; MFO would not come here. <BR> <BR>If DMO is a modest success: They carve out a niche market for themselves. The market for the games would likely overlap a bit, and for many, competing for a small playerbase isn&#39;t likely. <BR>Of course is Monster Rancher is a lot more popular in english speaking areas then Digimon it would affect the chances, but overall I think chances would me low. <BR> <BR>If DMO is a significant success, showing a large market for this sort of thing: There would be room for others to get their own piece of the pie. However if I recall correctly Lisa had stated in the past that the company that made MFO did not translated games into english. Perhaps potential profit would temp them but who knows. Chances maybe 50/50. Who knows. <BR> <BR>If DMO is a huge success &#40;near World of Warcraft level, so very unlikely&#41;: Maybe another company would buy out the current maker of MFO, to gain access to the online rights. Chances would be high but only if this scenario happened. <BR> <BR>These are only my semi-educated guesses. I&#39;m sure others would have more insight.

 I actually play the Korean DMO A LOT. It has a huge fan base in Korea and a lot of people outside of Korea play it.  I actually almost never see Koreans on the server I play.  Basically DMO is set up like MFO used to be.  If DMO succeeds which I dont think it will &#40;the company that took over their first Digimon MMO ruined it with their cash shop system&#41; that said if it DOES succeed then I would expect companies to hop right onto it and try to get Monster Rancher Online.  as long as their are no subscription fees to start i think they would be ok.  but don&#39;t make it so people that buy from cash shop are immediatly the greatest in the whole game.  give people who cant afford it a chance. just my thougts ^^ .  also DMO was supposed to come out this past December in english and I have no idea what happened to that announcement.  if I get any updates I will let you know as soon as possible

 Yeah I spent 80 dollars on DMO in the past like two  <BR>months D:  but everything in the cash shop was 50  <BR>percent off so I had to stock up while it lasted xD

 DMO and MFO should be so vastly different that there would be no impact &#62;_&#62;
