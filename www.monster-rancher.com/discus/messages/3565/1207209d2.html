Well, I finally made the trip to E3, and it was definitely a memorable event!  <BR> <BR>I was there on Thursday and Friday, and saw the whole show, plus got to hang out with the Tecmo group for quite a while. While I was there, several newsworthy things happened; I met many of the Japanese programmers, Tecmo&#39;s President, <I>and</I> I got to have an interview with Kanematsu-Sama: the Producer of the Monster Rancher games, Executive Officer and General Manager of the Creative Division at Tecmo. <BR> <BR>On Thursday, I was honored to meet Mr. Fukada, Tecmo&#39;s President. He was extremely gracious. His first words were, &#34;Lisa Shock! You are more famous than I am!&#34; Then, <I>&#40;surprise!&#41;</I> knew that I live in Phoenix, and introduced me to a sales manager who also lives here. We talked for a while, and Mr. Fukada was very pleased to discover that I play the Tecmo games in Japanese. <BR> <BR>I was then, at the back of the Tecmo booth, introduced to Itagaki-Sama &#40;head of Team Ninja&#41;, who, at first didn&#39;t seem to know what was going on, but then grabbed my name badge with one hand and my upper arm with the other and said loudly, &#34;Lisa Shock! I know you! I read the Forums all the time!&#34; &#40;Tecmo&#39;s Forums&#41; We talked a bit about the forums, before he had to run off to meetings. <BR> <BR>Of course, I met the whole crew from the US office and the wireless division. I had spoken to most of them on the phone, so there weren&#39;t so many surprizes. Everyone was busy running the game shows, so we didn&#39;t have much time to chit-chat. <BR> <BR>The Tecmo booth itself was setup on an angle inside the square footage allotted, so a stage and the viewers cut out a triangle on one corner, another corner was the wireless division &#40;left of the stage&#41; and the back two were offices for meetings and &#39;backstage&#39; areas. Game demos were also setup for Fatal Frame II &#40;PS2&#41;, and Ninja Gaiden. You can find lots of pics online. <BR> <BR>On Friday, I was very honored to have an hour-long meeting with Kanematsu-Sama, lead on the MR games, Executive Producer for the MR games, Executive Officer and General Manager of the Creative Division at Tecmo. He is a very artistic and masculine man, reminiscent of artists I knew when I lived in Santa Fe, NM. He had long hair and was wearing all black, the whole Tecmo Japan group dressed like rock stars &#40;very tailored and stylish&#41;, and he had several silver necklaces on and a ring on every finger, plus a bracelet -most of them animal related &#40;I recall one ring on his first finger which was an articulated lizard that moved, very cool!&#41;. We sat at the Tecmo Wireless bar, a bar made of white plexiglass with lights inside that constantly changed colors, and the game show stage was next to us. Here &#40;-cut and paste this url into another browser window http://www.lisa.netfirms.com/tecmobooth2.JPG &#41; is a picture of us talking, my back is to the camera &#40;yes, long hair&#41; and he is facing me, on the right side of the picture. With the game show happening just a few feet to my right, with spinning lights and sounds, sometimes the room itself seemed to be spinning and edged in lights  as I spoke to the man in charge of the next MR games. <BR> <BR>We spoke of many things, but my very first question was if there was a MR5 in the works. He said &#34;oh yes! -maybe not until Spring 2005 in Japan, it is just being started&#34; He was very re-assuring as I said I knew it wasn&#39;t Tecmo&#39;s best selling game and stated they were very committed to the MR series. He hinted at some big changes, but was not specific about them. <BR> <BR>He asked me what was my favorite MR game, and &#40;this was hard, really hard&#41; I sort of stammered about a bit, saying each game had great moments and things to endear people to it, and he pressed me to name a game &#40;and I was so afraid to offend, having studied Japanese ettiquette&#41;, he said &#34;Monster Rancher 1,2,3, or 4?&#34; I finally replied &#40;I wanted to be honest, but not insult him, and honestly, I like them all!&#41; that Monster Rancher Advance 2 is my favorite. He clapped his hands gleefully, and replied &#34;That&#39;s one of my games!&#34;<FONT SIZE="-2"><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">&#42;</FONT></FONT> Needless to say, I was relieved, and replied that I liked it because there was a lot to do, a lot of items and fairly complex unlocking of monsters. <BR> <BR>He then mentioned that he was meeting with Nintendo later that day to discuss details of the upcoming MR game for NDS. I nodded approval, and said fans were looking forward to it. <BR> <BR>He asked me what my favorite Monster is, those of you who know me know that I really love seeing them all, so I talked about what the North American fans liked: scary monsters in general, I rattled off a large list of the more &#39;grownup&#39; monsters. He asked about Naga in particular and a few others. I did mention that Zan in particular has taken off in popularity, far more so than the MR3 game which introduced it. I did mention my liking Doodles, and the Ganbare Gincun game they are from and he laughed. He then mentioned that Gali had been left out of MR4, and wondered if fans missed it. I was enthusiastic, and said yes. Gali wasn&#39;t used much in tournaments, but it was a fan favorite. I then showed him my Gali bracelet.<FONT SIZE="-2"><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">&#42;&#42;</FONT></FONT> He was genuinely fascinated by it, so I took it off so he could look closer at it. Then, rather impulsively I handed it to him and said he could have it. He said &#34;really?&#34; and I said, &#34;sure!&#34; and he quickly put it on his wrist. So, I suspect that he will remember the fans of Galis for quite some time. <BR> <BR>He then asked about Jells, which are very popular in Japan, and I told him that they have a following. I mentioned that Pixies were HUGE here, and they could probably make a game just about Pixies, although I knew about Mercurious Pretty &#40;an all Pixie game from another company, dreamcast and PC&#41; and that it wouldn&#39;t happen but that Pixies are a big draw. <BR> <BR>We discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the anime, in terms of advertizing, customer expectations, and how other games have thrived because they have a show on the air as a daily commercial. I pointed out that the anime may have had weaknesses, but any sort of contract for a new show would help sell games. We agreed to discuss this more in detail later, so there may be hope for a deal for a new series -possibly made by another company. <BR> <BR>We then discussed the ages of players, and how the games are really popular in Japan, but not as popular in the US/Canada. I made some observations about English language players, and the game in general, and he asked me to send emails to the Director of international marketing. <BR> <BR>He gave me his card, a very typical polite gesture in Japan, and asked for my email address so he could ask me questions later, as well as to &#39;CC&#39; the Director of International Marketing.  <BR> <BR>He had to run and meet with Nintendo, but overall, I was very pleased with our talk, and plan on corresponding with him regularly to help where I can. <BR> <BR>Oh one last note, my husband and I ate dinner at <A HREF="http://www.encounterrestaurant.com/" TARGET="_blank">Encounter</A> at the LA airport Wednesday night, and it was delicious and lits of fun! The staff is extremely attentive and the food is very bistro-hip; they make their own potato chips! &#40;well, so do I, but I admit it&#39;s a very rare thing&#41; <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="-2"><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">&#42;</FONT></FONT> The MR games have been made for so long that the series has outlasted some staff changes.  <BR><FONT SIZE="-2"><FONT COLOR="aa00aa">&#42;&#42;</FONT></FONT> I posted about this a while back, it&#39;s archived at: <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: The Cafe: Archived Topics From Prior Years: Year 2003 Topics &#40;Year of the Counter&#41;: My Gali Bracelet

 Wow Lisa, sounds like your dedication is reaping the rewards it truly deserves. My hat, for one, is off to you. <BR> <BR>In all honestly &#40;I&#39;ll pour my heart here a bit&#41;, I&#39;ve been a fan since I was in the 6th-7th grade, and started visiting B&#39;s board back in the day. I was a &#34;founding father&#34; here per say, as I was one of the first to transmigrate forums. Since then, I&#39;ve been a regular, and it must be said, I have met some of the best and coolest people I ever have on this site. <BR> <BR>To say you haven&#39;t been an influence in my life for the past 7 &#40;or 8?&#41; years would be a bold face lie. Through your site, I was able to find a source for writing, along with an early fan base and great support from people like torey and Eagle Fierce, and some good old fashion competition &#40;Black Razor&#41;. Now, I proudly try and carry that torch to the next set of amazing writing talent, and only hope I can be as influential to others as the ones I admired were to me. <BR> <BR>To tell you the truth, you have actually been an inspiration to me. Hard work, dedication, and all the while being fair and open, as well as active in your little project here since it began. Most people would have dropped it by now, but you didn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a few months shy of 21 now, and I&#39;m still here. <BR> <BR>And just looky how it all turned out. <BR> <BR>STILL getting new and awesome people joining. Authors, researchers, and the best of the best ranchers come here to do exactly what they do best. Not being paid or promoting anything, just because we have bright and positive examples like our glorious leader to follow in tow. <BR> <BR>All Hail Lisa! She sure deserves it!

 I&#39;ve been an MR fan since 5th grade when i got my PS2 for Christmas &#40;im in 8th now and going into 9th next year&#41;. I must say, that was the year I got my playstation 2 and i accidentaly opened  MR2 before i found the Playsation 2! So i&#39;ll probably remember MR games for a while. And about the show, i knew about it a long time before the game ever caught my attention. I&#39;d love to see them get a deal for a new one. See, MR never made it because it came out the year following Pokemon &#40;1999&#41; and everyone was so pikacrazy to even know it was on the air! But now, things have settled down and we could realy gain some popularity. But they&#39;d better hurry, One Piece &#40;the most popular anime/manga in japan&#41; and Naruto &#40;another popular one&#41; already have japanese toons and are looking to make english translations. If One Piece gets on the air first it will be the Pokemon scene all over again! Trust me, i read the manga &#40;thats already been translated&#41;. Oh well, its very exciting that you got to have so much fun, lisa.

 Wow, I actually talked to an internationally famous video game lady in chat! I am amazed. Congrats on seeing everything/one, and I really await MR5. I hope they put back &#39;Skill&#39; from the first two. It really screwed up the pattern when they took it out.

 HI-5 Lisa! I think it is every gamers dream to go to E3, test out the new games, and chat with the designers, hopefully getting some input of your own in the process. You have done all three. So this was the thing you were going to with some Japanese people. I wondered why you didn&#39;t tell what it was. I&#39;m sort of in the same boat as CHB. This site helped me start my writing, although I still ned to finish my current epic.....anywho..... How exciting is this? You got to talk with the one of the producers or MR, and he took your input! Hopefully the Gali bracelet will bring them back. It&#39;s good to know that there will be a MR5, and I&#39;m very interested on how they will incorporate the DS&#39;s dual screens into the MR series.  <BR> <BR>Once again a big HI-5 for Lisa!!!

 I love One Piece! &#40;Not a fan or Naruto though.&#41; <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t seem to find the last 30 or so episodes of One Piece, however, which makes me a sad panda. I was going to buy the series anyway. <BR> <BR>As for the MR cartoon, I think it could have went without Genki. I found him slightly irritating, with his power walking and all. The monster set up and plots weren&#39;t too bad though, and I always enjoyed the fights. <BR> <BR>But, now that Yugi-thingy is dieing off, too, maybe MR will get the spotlight soon enough.

 Thanks, everyone, I tried very hard to make a good impression on the Japanese &#40;I brought gifts&#41;, and to express some of our opinions about the games. I know that everyone is a bit envious about this opportunity, but I tried to speak about us as a group, not just about myself. <BR> <BR>Pattongeneral: to get into E3 you have to work in the game industry and be able to show paychecks and W2 forms, or a business license and tax forms from owning a game business. I was lucky enough that my credentials from having done work for Tecmo &#40;check stubs, in-game credit, message board moderating at the Tecmo forums&#41; were good enough to get me in. <BR> <BR>And, yes, there were two card games, one for GameBoy and one for PSX. The PSX game is particularly good, I like it a lot, it just didn&#39;t have a tv show on every day showing a teen with funny hair playing it.

 Yes, there was a MR CCG.  <BR> <BR>And, yes, the press can also get into E3, they get different access to certain things. To get in on a press pass, you have to be able to show credentials from a recognized news organization -just having a website doesn&#39;t cut it.

 Doesn&#39;t matter, the show is a TRADE show for the interactive entertainment industry. If you don&#39;t work in the industry, or report on it, you cannot get in. They are really tough about the 2 peices of identification requirement. -If it were easy to get in, then a lot more people than the 65,000 or so who did attend would have attended. There are certainly more than 65,000 teenagers who wanted to go in Los Angeles alone. The only &#39;stars&#39; I saw were doing signings in booths. Most people walking around were there to do business.
