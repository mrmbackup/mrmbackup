 It is 4 AM here and I  called ahead to my local Walmart. <BR>They said that they will have it there. <BR>WOOT WOOT!

 Deffinitally let us know if you find a copy. <BR> <BR>As of right now Amazon, gamestop, and Walmart.com have it listed as not available online. <BR> <BR>Gamestop also lists it as not available in any stores. <BR> <BR>Indeed it could be the situation where this is the ship day and stores will not have it until tomorrow, but yesterday gamestop had it listed as ships in 24 hours and now has it listed as unavailable online. It smells fishy to me, and saddly smells like an unexpected delay which I really REALLY hope is not the case. <BR> <BR>Then again I&#39;m going freaking nuts with Starcraft II, so if it get&#39;s delayed it won&#39;t be the end of the world.

 Maybe you caught it on the transition from pre-orders to normal orders. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have to check when I get out of work to see if I get any pre-order pick up phone calls.

 It seems that UFO has officially announced its release on their twitter and facebook page. Today is the shipping date, theoretically it should be in stores tomorrow.

 Call the store first, this is the shipping date and many/most/all stores won&#39;t have it available until tomorrow. It&#39;s better safe then sorry.

 I just got a call from gamestop saying it will be available Thursday..... but they only call the day before not 2 days before so I hope that was just a mix up on the part of the automated system.

 Well I went today, but no dice. The guy said that he thought it might&#39;ve been pushed back &#40;but he didnt check the system or anything, so he may not know what he was talking about&#41;.

 Probably for the best 321228322 since most gamestops will not have it until today, or thursday, or even later possibly.

 Well I stopped at my gamestop where my two copies were pre-ordered and guess what.  USP shows the box not arriving until.....FRIDAY! <BR> <BR>Yeah, it&#39;s not going to kill me but it is annoying.

 I&#39;ve snooped around and found out the exact reason  <BR>why we don&#39;t have Monster Rancher DS at our  <BR>retailers. <BR> <BR>Seems like UFO has a different way of releasing titles,  <BR>the release date was the 3rd, but instead that is the  <BR>date they ship out the product to stores, not the date  <BR>stores have it. Hence why  <BR>we keep getting odd dates.

 That is actually how it works with a majority of releases, except for big name titles. To be safe it&#39;s always best to assume that a game will come out the day after its &#34;release&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Someone has shown proof of getting a copy on the Gamefaqs forums, and he lives in Ohio, so we may be seeing this today or tomorrow.

 My local gamestop says it is en route also.  Tomorrow it appears. <BR> <BR> The encouraging thing was that they told me a few others were also looking for it yesterday and today.

 Got it here! &#40;Pennsylvania&#41; <BR>It wasn&#39;t in the &#34;system&#34;, as gamestop.com said there were no copies locally available, but the sales guy looked in the drawers behind the cashier&#39;s counter and found it. I guess it just arrived. <BR> <BR>:&#41;

 I called my local gamestop here in AZ and they didn&#39;t have it in yet today either.  But they did say yesterday that ups showed it arriving Friday so I wasn&#39;t really expecting it today. <BR> <BR>I have to say, what a mess up on release.

 We got it in Philly today &#40;at least at Gamestop&#41;, and it seems to being pretty well. There was only two copies left when I showed up, and you best believe one left with me! <BR> <BR>One of the employees was a fan of the series, which was pretty awesome.

 Now that you mention it, its kinda odd cause both places I went, the employees were aware of the game series &#40;just not that another game was coming out&#41;. <BR> <BR>One had trouble finding it, thinking it was a console game and not a DS game. <BR> <BR>It seems to have some noteriety, but maybe too many buy resold copies. :P
