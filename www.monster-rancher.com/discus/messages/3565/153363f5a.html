 I found a rather unobtrusive way to spam this out at work.  Basically I asked by department&#39;s alias if anyone owned a DS/DSi/DSlite if they&#39;d like a recommendation.  To everyone that replied, I then provided the information to them directly with links, descriptions etc. and to please feel free to pass the information along to Anyone they know &#40;people with kids, co workers, spouses, or other family members&#41; with a DS.  Hopefully chain emails will work well in this regard. <BR>:&#41; <BR> <BR>Additionally, I suggested the same thing to other gamers in other departments &#40;to ask their depts. for interest, then reply with details to those that are interested&#41;

 It&#39;s a pretty neat site. Got to see some pictures I didn&#39;t before. <BR> <BR>My only concern in the pre-order link lead to Gamestop which didn&#39;t have MR:DS for pre-order yet but did have a special Pokemon offer on the front page. XD

 Yeah I noticed that too, a bit counter productive. They should really make sure that they are listed with Gamestop and then link directly to that page instead of just the DS opening.

 Local Gamestops in my area still aren&#39;t taking pre-orders. Hmmm I&#39;m not that far from the Canadian border, maybe I should go check and see what&#39;s going on up there.

 I&#39;m going to Gamestop today to pick up Tatsunoko vs Capcom and possibly No More Heros 2, I&#39;m going to inquire if it&#39;s in the system yet. If not I&#39;m going to ask them to report it to corporate. Here&#39;s hoping they have it listed though!

 If anyone is looking for a good fighting game, Tatsunoko Vs Capcom is Extremely Fun!!! Time just flies in the game, and it is both simple and complex at the same time. <BR> <BR>If anyone get&#39;s it let me know so we can possibly exchange some friend codes! <BR> <BR>Anyway on to more Monster Ranching news, I am currently writing a few emails to corporate and including the Canadian SKU so they have something to go off of. I will let you guys know if I hear anything back!

 I don&#39;t know what a Tatsunko is, but the vrs Capcom series is always good for an enjoyable fighter. <BR> <BR>Mass Effect 2 is awesome, by the way. Very cinematic. Very cool. <BR> <BR>On topic, I&#39;m on good terms with the guys at my local GS, so they will probably call me just as soon it is available for pre-order.

 Yeah I went to my local gamestop specifically to see if they had it in their system yet and the worker first responded with &#34;I have no idea&#34;.....   <BR> <BR>After looking in the computer he told me that it wasn&#39;t available for pre-order.  However, if it&#39;s in the system and they therefor have a sku for it I know for a fact &#40;as a former assistant manager&#41; that it can in fact be pre-ordered.  It doesn&#39;t have to be on &#34;the list&#34; for it to be done.

 I still wish I was though. I swear, when I was ordering it, it said,&#34; To be shipped on 26/01/10,&#34; or something like that. Probably a major typo.

 The placeholder date so far is 3/31/2010, which is what still worries me a bit about this titles launch. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s supposedly two months away and we still only have a &#34;placeholder&#34; date and no real announcement about the game other then, we are releasing it and another game in march.  <BR> <BR>If they wanted this game to do well wouldn&#39;t they be trying a bit more marketing or feeding their fans with a bit more information?  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s because of this that I am honestly thinking the game won&#39;t be released until after the spring season and closer the summer possibly. Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver are being released a couple of weeks before the supposed release of MRDS, and is probably their most direct competition. Normally a company would wait for that hype to die down a bit so that their title will see a bit more of the spotlight. I really really hope that they push this game and it is released in March. Spring is my most busy time of year and I normally work about 80 hour weeks...it would be really nice to able to go home and play a new Monster Rancher to relieve some stress! <BR> <BR>Give us some more info Tecmo, pleeeaase!

 It&#39;s hard to guess at the motives of a corporation. It&#39;s possible that saving money on advertisement by cutting back on fanfare and relying on the fans to do the work for them is a part of the profit strategy for this item. When you&#39;re dealing with the kind of money that we&#39;re talking about here, sometimes the ways it is made can be pretty counter intuitive. <BR> <BR>My thought is, I&#39;m divided. On the one hand, I wants my game right now! On the other, I know it will swallow up my whole life once it comes out, so a wait is probably for the best. But, as the young lady in Willy Wonka so famously sang; &#34;Don&#39;t care how, I want it now!&#34;

 Yeah I get that too, but normally if that was the case most companies would release more info to the fans so they can spread the hype. Hype for a good game that could have otherwise flown under the radar worked extremely well with games like Blazblue and Demons Souls, and it could work great here.  <BR> <BR>Without any information as to where to order it though we are almost hyping a game that doesn&#39;t yet exist.

 Tecmo may be waiting for the Nintendo people to give them a firm production date. The Canadian date may be speculation. <BR> <BR>In the past, Tecmo has not announced dates unless they were set in stone. The ONLY MR game to slip off a date was MR3, which was held up because Sony PS2 disc factory ran out of plastic after 9/11 when all air traffic and most shipping was halted for a couple of weeks.

 What a fascinating bit of trivia.  <BR> <BR>MR 3 is one of the few MR games I didn&#39;t get as soon after launch as possible. I didn&#39;t have a PS2 at that point, you see. But it was one of the first games I got when I did get my PS2. <BR> <BR>And of course, for what it was compared to the other two, well... that&#39;s a whole other discussion.
