Not part of MY wish list. <BR>plant/ jell= Fruity jam <BR>plant/zan= shadow roots <BR>plant/mock&#40;i can&#39;t believe i never thought of this one bvefore&#41;= Giai&#40;how do you spell it again?&#41;  <BR>plant/ripper= killer brocoli?nah. how about bladed roots?

 How about we looked at the lists that are available here at MRM? I don&#39;t know about Eric B, but that&#39;s what I did &#40;mainly to know what games they were in&#41;. Yah, think about it. Maybe I wasn&#39;t being sarcastic. Indeed.

 i see my mistake. i have found only 5 different plant sub breeds, which were found in monster ranher 1&amp;2. however, it is pointless to remind me, because i am only posting monsters of which i would like to see in monster rancher 5 therefore, STOP FRIGGIN REMINDING ME THAT THEY&#39;RE ALREADY THERE! besides, i don&#39;t MR 1 and 2, i don&#39;t know where to find mr1, but i borrow my cousin&#39;s copy.

 &#34;Hey, Infernos &amp; Eric, guess what? Not everyone has played MR2, and not everyone owns a Game Boy Advice! So maybe you can keep the sarcasm to yourselves...&#34; <BR> <BR>Also to include: <BR> <BR>&#34;however, it is pointless to remind me, because i am only posting monsters of which i would like to see in monster rancher 5 therefore, STOP FRIGGIN REMINDING ME THAT THEY&#39;RE ALREADY THERE!&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Maybe you should start a &#39;renaming&#39; thread for tecmo instead of a &#39;wishlist&#39; in which you simply change their names. <BR> <BR>If you want monsters to make a return, ask for THOSE monsters, don&#39;t make up new ones. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t own a GBA, and never played the MRA games. I own MR3, but quit after my third monster. I never played MR1 or Hop-About, either. <BR> <BR>How about that? I&#39;ve successfully played the following MR titles. <BR> <BR>MR2 <BR>MR3 &#40;if it even counts&#41; <BR>MR4 <BR> <BR>And I still don&#39;t come up with stupid stuff like just renaming monsters. Just because people would like to see actual NEW monsters on a wish list, or a NEW combination of a prime breed and a sub, doesn&#39;t earn a reply telling them to basically shut up. Not playing the games doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t browse here. Its an archive. <BR> <BR>I see no &#39;sarcasm&#39; in Eric&#39;s or Infernus&#39;s quotes. They said flat, &#34;Stop naming monsters that exist.&#34; <BR> <BR>And why? THAT&#39;S POINTLESS. We currently have a monster list. <BR> <BR>Off that... <BR> <BR>I want to see a Kato/Henger. Claws could be plasma blades, three on each hand. WEEEE! &#42;shudders&#42; <BR> <BR>One of the monsters I always wanted to see was a Hydra type, but I was making that suggestion back for MR3. Like a Dragon, with three heads and two tails, then subtract the wings and arms. Change the scales to something more like a snake, add some attacks, and you got yourself a Hydra. <BR> <BR>Someone wanted something like a Werelion once, named the breed Leo, and it sounded pretty sweet. Like a monk with a sword, mixed with a paladin and the king of the cats. <BR> <BR>Someone else wanted, and I quote, &#34;A Killer Chicken&#34;. I regretfully informed him that Duckons existed. They said they wanted a Rambo bird, to include some form of semi-automatic weapon. <BR> <BR>Either way, I&#39;m not trying to be rude, but I have to back who I believe is right. Everyone already knows that if MR5 comes out, most people want all the monsters from all the games, for shear playability reasons. <BR> <BR>So stop naming them.

 My point was, I didn&#39;t know, so why criticize? <BR>Anyway, I saw a post or two saying they liked how Jokers looked in MR1&amp;2, but not how they look in 3&amp;4.

 My most-wanted wish: I just want the story to be longer and BETTER, for Pete&#39;s sake. I mean, I already predicted WAY before the ending that Wit took the damned book. The kind of plot&#39;s been done with in so many cartoons &#40;and games&#41;. I need something I can say &#34;wow, I didn&#39;t realize THAT&#34; at it. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s kinda amusing, a kiddy plot mixed in a raising-game that even challenges a pro-gamer or adult.....which audience are they really going for?

By &#34;depth&#34;, did you mean the plot or the gameplay? &#40;If I sound stupid again, sorry. T_T&#41; <BR> <BR>I need a game wherein &#34;supporting&#34; characters &#40;read: RIO&#41; don&#39;t practically hog the glory and be practically perfect. Also please...no more stereotypes and maniacs willing to wield the ultimate evil &#40;my gosh, Xevion was such a piece of cake&#41; just to beat someone who they lost to--first time of their lives--looong time ago &#40;spoiler removed by mod&#41;. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;m glad nonetheless of the story--the previous MR&#39;s &#40;I dunno about the first one, though&#41; didn&#39;t have a story to begin with anyway.

 Oh 1 more thing...A monster auction where you can bid on monsters that you don&#39;t have or want, also put your own monsters to be bid on. <BR> <BR>Ex: Moo monster is at auction, you don&#39;t have any CD&#39;s with him so you pay the minimum bid then another trainer bids and so on until someone quits. <BR> <BR>Another would be an online tournament via x-port or PS2 online or even PS2-PS connection. Whoever wins can get some ultra-rare uber monster or game extras or even game money for their game as a prize.

 As for online Monster Ranchers.... what would you do, go as a monster and battle everyone you meet? Haha. <BR>But really, if it was an MMORPG, it wouldn&#39;t be a rancher anymore, would it? <BR>Unless it would be something like Sims Online where everyone has their own ranch. -_-;

 I&#39;m still waiting for a MMORPG version of pokemon. Monster rancher, you could make it so that the ranches aren&#39;t actually on a map. When you go to the ranch you pick which ranch you want to go to and the game just takes you there.

 Slow down a little, people. Don&#39;t do what pokemon did and use up all the original ideas up at once. Then later u&#39;ll be left with just a bunch&#39;a crap. Also, try to put a lot of thought into your suggestions and how they would impact the rest of the games elements. I don&#39;t mean to be a jerk or anything, but a lot of the things suggested in the forums would probably just cheapen the gameplay and overcomplicate things, unless you gave the game an intire overhaul and redid everything from monsters to the battle system.
