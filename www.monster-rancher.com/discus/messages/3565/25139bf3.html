 do you have a college student you want to raise? <BR>are you a parent? a teacher, a prof? <BR>or yourself a university bum? <BR> <BR>ive discovered a nice training methodology, <BR>and all the variables apply to most college students, &#40;some weirdo breeds like philosophy and english majors have yet to be tested&#41; <BR> <BR>first, lets consider &#34;loyalty&#34; <BR>in terms of college students, we can rename this as &#34;morale&#34;, with the factors below  <BR> <BR>1.&#41; paranoia <BR>2.&#41; delight <BR>3.&#41; boredom <BR> <BR>all these factors go up to 100 and are calculated as follows. <BR> <BR>MORALE = &#40;ParaNoia &#43; Delight&#41; / Boredom <BR> <BR>...which you can tell, a bored college student has VERY VERY LOW morale. <BR> <BR>and also, paranoia can be a good thing, since it makes these students edged up, while delight contributes a psitive attitude in education.  however, a high paranoia level can often lead most college studetns to suicide and such..... <BR>so be careful with items and classes/drills that make high paranoia <BR> <BR>other college major/breeds that BENEFIT from paranoia are : <BR> <BR>theatre, <BR>speech and debate, <BR>communist society, <BR>libertarian students organiztion, <BR>etc. <BR> <BR> <BR>high morale can lead to better grades, <BR>a decrease in slacking off and a better work ethic. <BR> <BR> <BR>stress and fatigue are also factors, <BR>and work the same way in MR2. <BR>except that lifespan hits occur DAILY, not after each hour., <BR>and lifespan hits count for one day for each point. <BR> <BR>heres a typical day for myself, <BR> <BR>1. Hard Drill : Computer Science - C&#43;&#43; <BR>2. Hard Drill : Calculus, scince engr, brdth <BR>3. Hard Drill : Philosophy, intro to logic <BR>4. Hard Drill : Physics 4a <BR>5. Rest       : Philosophy, intro to ethics. <BR> <BR>some of these drills affect morale, <BR>Ethics : &#43; 50 Boredom, &#43; 5 stress, &#43; -100 fatigue <BR>&#40;i usually sleep in this class&#41; <BR>Logic : &#43;30 delight, &#43;20 paranoia, &#43; 10 fatigue, <BR> &#43; 10 stress <BR>Physics : - 25 Boredom, &#43;10 Paranoia, &#40;no stress, no fatigue, i find this easy.&#41; <BR>C &#43;&#43; :  -25 boredom, &#43; 10 delight &#40;no stress or fatigue&#41; <BR>Calculus : &#43;10 Paranoia, &#43;2 Delight &#43; 50 stress, &#43; 50 fatigue <BR>  &#40;varies for college students with other majors&#41; <BR> <BR>...in between these drills, i use the following items : <BR> <BR>1. Red Bull : -25 fatigue, &#43;1 paranoia, &#43; delight <BR>2. redbull  :  <BR>3. redbull  : <BR>4. redbull  : <BR>5. cigaretee :  -1 form, plus 0.005% emphesyma, plus 0.1% cancer, -100 fatigue, -100 stress.  &#43;50 delight, &#43;50 paranoia, -50 boredom. <BR>     <BR>...now redbulls have a CUMULATIVE effect, for each redbull a college students takes, you get &#42;1.5 on effects for each consecutive red bull. <BR> <BR>cigarettes are often my favorite, the fatigue and stress levels go way way down, not to mention i smoke BEFORE ethics class, so that almost all my fatigue and stress gets wiped out at the end of the day, result : 0 lifespan hits. well, except for the chances for those evil diseases, but thats ok.   <BR> <BR> this training methodology works only for computer scinece majors, prob engineers and math people too,  factors that are very detrimental to these breeds are : <BR> <BR>marijuana : -1 points per drill &#40;varies for other majors&#41;, -1 memory,  <BR> <BR>english courses : -1 lifespan hit, &#43;200 boredom, per drill <BR> <BR>...there are other items out there too : <BR> <BR>coffee : &#43; 60 paranoia, -50 stress, &#43; 10 delight. <BR>twinkies : &#43;10 form, &#43; 10 boredom <BR>monster rancher 2 : &#43; 100 delight, &#43;10 paranoia, - 50 stress. <BR>playboy magazine : &#43; 100 fatigue &#40;varies&#41;, - 20 stress, &#43; 30 delight. <BR> <BR> <BR>tell me your training methods.... <BR>hopefully we can breed and train college students in a better manner,

If this technique fails, morale drops 95% <BR> <BR>GUTS = 45, Probability = S &#40;98%&#41; <BR> <BR>Hope&#39;s Light: Enables Eagle to put a positive spin on almost anything, enabling him to cheer up any that may need help.  This also gives him a delusional goal that the Fierce sets out to make reality.  This technique has three chances to succeed before draining morale, very strenuous &#40;&#43;40 stress&#41; and heavy on GUTS consumption. <BR> <BR>GUTS = 89, Probability = B &#40;78%&#41; <BR> <BR>Earth Lightning:  Eagle uses his aerodynamic body to charge forward, maxing agility shortly. This projects a great deal of force, and is difficult to stop once activated.  It is most commonly used to escape danger situations, warn friends, or act as a messenger...it also gets used frequently when he&#39;s late for class. <BR> <BR>GUTS = 35, Force = A, Hit% D, Withering A, Sharpness S <BR> <BR>Winged Songbird:  A semi-golden voice projected form his heart soothes all pain in the vicinity.  Requires extensive amounts of GUTS and relativley low morale to utilize. <BR> <BR>GUTS = 99, Force = C, Hit% = A, Withering = S, Sharpness = S <BR> <BR>Dove&#39;s Charm:  A constant glaze of his eyes that makes him look docile and trustworthy.  Upgrades to Soul&#39;s Reflection &#40;self-explanatory&#41;. <BR> <BR>GUTS = 15, Probability = S &#40;99%&#41; <BR> <BR>Soul&#39;s Reflection <BR> <BR>GUTS = 20, Probabiltiy = S &#40;100%&#41;, fatigue and stress = -30 <BR> <BR>Concentration:  Increases focus on subject material &#40;nose in book&#41;, but loses equivalent lifespan due to being inept to knowing what is going on around him. <BR> <BR>GUTS = 75, Probablility = C &#40;74%&#41;, Life dedctn. = var. <BR> <BR>Light Shower:  Eagle projects his positive energies throughout a single room.  This totally drains him, and he needs to rest afterwards. <BR> <BR>GUTS = 101, Force = A, hit% = C, Withering = &#43;27 to spirit, sharpness = A <BR> <BR>Mediator&#39;s Rule:  Uses his positive energies to convince reconciliation with a colleague.  Fully drains GUTS, &#43;80 stress. <BR> <BR>GUTS = 99 Probability = D &#40;68%&#41; <BR> <BR>Honorable Rage:  Activated when Eagle has been done wrong, or under intense stress.  Power quadruples from adreniline rush.  Afterwards, Eagle will be 100% stressed and 80% tired. <BR> <BR>GUTS = 80, Force = S, Hit% = B, Withering = E, Sharpness = A <BR> <BR>Deathblow Combo:  Eagle performs a lightning quick combination, consisting of three kicks; speed snap side kick to the body, back pivot to the kidneys, spinning axe kick to the collar bone or head.  This is often a fatal series of techniques, designed for multiple targets if cornered, and is rarely used. <BR> <BR>GUTS = 25, Force = S, Hit% = S, Withering = E, Sharpness = D <BR> <BR>Speeding Dynamo Combo:  Eagle performs three martial arts techniques to quickly dispatch a single foe; ridge hand to the face, spinning elbow to the nose, knee kick to the groin. <BR> <BR>GUTS = 10, Force = D, Hit% = S, Withering = B, Sharpness = S <BR> <BR>&#40;more to come, but I&#39;m to tired to finish the list now.

 Name: Celious &#34;Cel&#34; Khyrsal &#40;Writer/Melodramatic/Opimist&#41; <BR> <BR>Life: 300 <BR>Power: 255 <BR>Intelligence: 590 &#40;&#40;My I.Q. to the best of my knowledge is 121 or so, so I guessed in MR terms it would be around here.&#41;&#41; <BR>Skill: 427 <BR>Speed: 300 &#40;&#40;At max.  Usually runs slower than max, but when I really have to rush it, I&#39;m faster than I look.  Plus playing DDR has helped a tad.&#41;&#41; <BR>Defence: 45 <BR> <BR>Nature: Pacifist &#40;Unless you get him pissed...then watch out...&#41;  <BR> <BR>Form: &#42;Pleads the fifth&#42; <BR> <BR>Style: Spoiled <BR> <BR>Likes: Reading, Playing DDR, Hanging with friends, Online Roleplaying <BR> <BR>Dislikes: Pain, Needles, Sports, Vegetables <BR> <BR>Age: 17 years, 4 months <BR> <BR>Life Stage: Somewhere between 1 and 2 <BR> <BR>Techniques: <BR> <BR>Optimism: Finds the bright side to almost any situation. <BR>Guts = 25  Probability = A <BR> <BR>Cheer Up: Attempts to cheer up a friend. <BR>Guts = 30  Probability = B <BR> <BR>Imaginitive Genesis: Starts to think up new ideas for fictional characters, weapons, spells, etc.  Although not exactly useful, it reduces total stress by half. <BR>Guts = 25  Probability = A <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;m not the best at judging my personality, I know that sounds wierd, but it&#39;s true.  I&#39;m sure Eagle could do better at saying how my personality is and make up &#34;techs&#34; based on it.  If he wants something to do, he can add to it&#41; <BR> <BR>Natural High: Draws energy from body to increase strength, speed also increases somewhat.  Determination increases as well.  If body is in too much pain, it has a greater probability of failure.  Using it too much drains him, and requires about 24 hours of rest to recooperate if used too much. <BR>Guts = 50  Probability = A  <BR> <BR>Holy Cannon Punch: Focuses strength into his fist to deliver a smashing blow. <BR>Heavy Tech, Power Based.  Guts = 10  Force = S  Hit % = D  Withering = D  Sharpness = E <BR> <BR>Rising Kick: A rising kick to the opponent&#39;s jaw. <BR>Power Based.  Guts = 5  Force = B  Hit % = B  Withering = E  Sharpness = D <BR> <BR>Double Rising Kick: Delivers two kicks instead of one. <BR>Power Based.  Guts = 15  Force = A  Hit % = B  Withering = E  Sharpness = C <BR> <BR>Beat Combo: An attack delivering three quick punches to the abdomen. <BR>Power Based.  Guts = 10  Force = C  Hit % = A <BR>Withering = E  Sharpness = E <BR> <BR>Cross Punch: Delivers a backhand blow with the right fist, then an uppercut with the left. <BR>Power Based.  Guts = 20  Force = S  Hit % = B <BR>Withering = C  Sharpness = D <BR> <BR>Lion Spirit Combo: His special attack.  A series of backhand blows and punches, trips the opponent, focuses power into fist, and delivers a smashing palm strike to the center of the chest at the opponent&#39;s heart.   <BR>Special Tech.  Good Tech.  Power Based.  Guts = 60  Force = S  Hit % = A  Whithering = A  Sharpness = B <BR> <BR>Pride Protection: Celious sees his friends as a part of his &#34;pride&#34;.  Used when his friends are in trouble, he starts to fight to protect them, not giving up until he&#39;s either beaten to near death or his opponent goes down...although there is a chance he can go a bit too far, and still maul at the opponent even after he goes down.   <BR>Special Tech.  Good Tech.  Power Based.   <BR>Guts = n/a  Force = S  Hit % = S  Withering = S  Sharpness = A <BR> <BR>Hell Claw: The opposite of &#34;Pride Protection&#34; in terms of driving force in emotion.  He&#39;ll attack with a bloodlust, even after the opponent falls he&#39;ll beat them senseless.  Although it will only be used when he&#39;s really ticked off. <BR>Special Tech.  Evil Tech.  Power Based. <BR>Guts = 99  Force = S  Hit % = S  Withering = S <BR>Sharpness = A <BR> <BR>Self Sacrifice: Attempts to take the hit in place of friend in physical battles so he gets hit instead. <BR>Guts = 20  Probability = B

 Some of you should get into the online RPG I run called RPG Combat.  You could definately make some interesting player characters, and seem to know how to make special abilities pretty well, which is one of the best things about my game &#40;making up your own moves instead of only being able to choose from a list&#41;.

 Alreaqdy one step ahead of you, Nate.  I&#39;m just getting redy to dowload a program I found out about code-named &#34;Wild Tangent.&#34;  It will allow me to program games just as well as the pros, only it&#39;ll use web space, instead of the CDs.  I&#39;m going to use it to get noticed, and make my dreams come true! ^_^

 Back to the drawing board for me.  The Wild Tangent requires the use of medium to high expertise in Javasriptc to be at optimum levels, and I coulnd&#39;t program to save my life.  How do you do the on-line RPG, Nate?

 It&#39;s based on ICQ chat rooms, because they allow you to see what the other person types as they type it, giving you greater responsiveness.  Once I get back on my home computer, I&#39;ll post a link to our main site.

 Javascript? I almost HATE javascript. HTML? Easy! On my website I used some Javascript. It&#39;s those little grey boxes that pop up when you get on some pages. No I did not make one of those annoying pages where you get on it and there are about 100&#40;literally!!!&#41; of those boxes and you can&#39;t do anything except close them. Of course I used HTML since I like it. As a matter of fact the main reason I made my site was to test out my HTML somewhere besides the HTML Playground. The Man don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll still visit. Let&#39;s get it active again. be seein&#39; ya <BR>/0&#62; ^-^ &#60;0&#92;

For those interested in RPG Combat, here&#39;s the main website: <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/afe_prog/noframes.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.geocities.com/afe_prog/noframes.html</A> <BR> <BR>However, we should be updating soon &#40;if not as I type&#41;, so it may be a little weird.  The basic game mechanics are in the rule book &#40;look carefully in the list of stuff&#41;, and sometime our web guy should be adding in some more personal touches like comments from people about what they love about the game, etc.  There&#39;s even a message board!

 To Crim1null: <BR>Yes, I am a girl &#40;23 years old... one of the middle-aged of the board&#41;. No, I&#39;m not officially married yet, but yes, I am pregnant. Due any day now, in fact. Start those stopwatches! And yes, I am ex-Canadian, moving to the States. And no, Kurasu isn&#39;t my real name. Just a well-used nickname. Heck, I even recieve mail as &#39;Kurasu&#39; most of the time. <BR> <BR>To Nate: <BR>I may have to check the place out and see. It could be kinda interesting. Fun, at the very least.

 Hey! I&#39;m 29.  That qualifies me for a wheelchair around here! &#40;yes of course taken as a joke ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on my raising method for the elusive HR administrator monster.  It&#39;s actually a lot more fun than I thought it was going to be.  The passive/aggression battle special is turning out to be very nasty BTW.
