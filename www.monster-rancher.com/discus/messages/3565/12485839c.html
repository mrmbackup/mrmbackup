I was wondering if I held a gathering at a hotel in Phoenix &#40;Paradise Valley, precisely&#41; if people would be interested in showing up for a couple days. I am thinking about possibly August 5-6, 2005. I have in mind an <A HREF="http://embassysuites.hilton.com/en/es/hotels/index.jhtml?moreDesc=true&amp;ctyhocn=PHXPVES" TARGET="_blank">all-suites hotel</A> where rooms run about $90 a night. I&#39;d get a room to use as a hospitality suite &#40;and reserve it for the 3rd - 7th to help out people checking in/out&#41;, and host some tourneys, bring my Japanese PS2 and show off some Japanese Tecmo games, and a few other events. My question right now is, would anyone actually show up - would another date in summer be better?

 I&#39;m always up for social gatherings. But in truth, ranching would be one of the last things I&#39;d want to do.

 Ok, PT, point taken. The hotel is in an area where there is a lot to do. There are all sorts of restaraunts to hang out in, a mall to visit, a big comic store, plus hotel amenities like the pool and jacuzzi. <BR> <BR>I just figured that some people might enjoy a few live tourneys, especially some of the people with &#39;grudges&#39; &#40;and MRA2 players who have never had a chance for a tourney&#41;. And, since I do own a wide assortment of Tecmo&#39;s Japanese games and the Japanese PS2, people might want to see what some of the differences in the MR games are, plus get a look at games that were Japan only, like Angel Eyes. We could even play the MR CCG game. And, there is a chance I could get a special guest to drop by. <BR> <BR>There would still be time for socializing, I just thought that people would be interested in a few MR related activities. You would not have to attend the activities, you could always go over to Atomic Comics and enter a HeroClix tournament. <BR> <BR>Torey, I understand. You may have to sneak out to get here, or may not be able to attend at all. I was simply hoping that an early announcement would help people schedule vacation time.

 I can&#39;t. Sorry. <BR> <BR>Military has AEF brackets for deployments, and that is smack in the middle of mine. <BR> <BR>Not saying I&#39;m going somewhere, but if something happens I&#39;ll be one of the first to go in.

 I only picked this weekend because it is very cheap to stay here, it is generally one of the hottest of the year. BTW, there are 2 AFB&#39;s nearby so dropping in won&#39;t be a problem.

 Well, depending on any situations that develope in the next year, I&#39;d be down with going somewhere considerably warmer than Alaska for a few weeks, then bounce into Texas and spend some time with my family. <BR> <BR>I could work it in, if everything continues smoothly.

 Ok, it&#39;s not a huge deal if not everyone can go, and I am not trying to press you on issues of national security.

 Hmm...sounds like it could be fun.  No way possible for August to work though.  Earlier or later would be better.  I always like to travel.

 Well I can go it is not too far, will anybody from Tecmo be there, if so I have 4 co-workers from Square Enix that live in Glendale that could come, that would be fun to see employees from both companes there.

 Forgot to add, most people would not want to go 100-1000 miles to a &#34;Monster Rancher&#34; convension, and especialy stay for 3 weeks. The only reason I can do that is because I can just drive there, most can&#39;t because they live out of state.

 I have a program planned out. I do not need attendies bringing PR people from outside companies to the event. If non-MR related people want a place on the program they will have to become a paying sponsor for the event.
