 Hi guys. I&#39;m new here, and I&#39;ve played Monster Rancher 1, 2, advance 1 and advance 2. Seeing all the things that could be better in these games makes me cringe, so let&#39;s take a look at what we will make better for our new game: Monster Rancher Platinum &#40;Name taken from previous thread&#41;.  <BR> <BR>First off, we could get a hold of Tecmo and say &#34;Here&#39;s what we want&#34; and show them a paper with all new suggestions on it, signed by everyone here at Monster Rancher Metropolis! They probably won&#39;t listen to us... but who cares! We can try, right? &#40;take it easy with the flaming, i&#39;m a little 13 year old girl.&#41; <BR> <BR>That being said, we should have a 3d landscape with a chibi &#40;minimized version&#41; of ourselves &#40;we choose the gender&#41;. Our monster would tag along behind us in the same minimized 3d state on the large scale 3d map. On the map, we have a house that we can enter with a trophy room, and book of monsters that you have generated so far, and another book saying which monsters you have bred so far, listing the parents likes, dislikes, traits, and stats, and the offsprings aswell. That&#39;s right folks! Along with raising your monster, you can now actually breed them! Near your house, stands your stable, inwhich you can keep up to six monsters at a time &#40;new and improved barn!&#41; Next to the Stable stands a fenced in area, where you put the two monsters you want to mate and produce offspring. Of course, this means we&#39;d actually have to have male and female monsters! Woohoo! Getting back to the map, there will be stratedgic points where you can go, such as the forest, or near-by mountain range, to do certain drills. You can also just walk around with your monster, having it do random things at your command &#40;it will only use a simple &#39;attack&#39; action to do so, usually triggering cinematic events&#41;. No matter what you do though, your monsters abilities go up &#40;for instance, have it attack a boulder, and POWER goes up&#41;, even if you are just walking around all day &#40;LIFE goes up&#41;! Internal clock is a must for the day and night function, as certain wild or stray monsters can come out, and battle you at certain times of day or night. As you proceed to go on your little adventure, the wear and tear of what you do will begin to show on the mini monster. Before your monster dies of exhaustion, you must retire to your home. At the door you will be treated to a small screen with two options: ENTER or RETIRE. Select retire and you may rest. Signs of aging will show on each monster, and they WILL DIE if you let them get old enough. The choice to retire them is YOURS, and YOURS ALONE. :&#41; sorry about all the caps... <BR> <BR>Somewhere in the general vecinity of your home will be a town &#40;with the usual shrine, market, lab, monster commitee where you completely retire it or make it a coach for errantry, and you may also learn of upcoming events.&#41; Also, there will be other little houses and ranches in that area as well. You can even find ruins at certain places on the map.  <BR> <BR>Touching on the idea of making your monster yours. Making it unique. You may alter your monster&#39;s appearance, but only slightly. Doing so can also alter your monster&#39;s likes, dislikes and traits. Give it a sweater and it will begin to like the warmth rather than cold. In turn, it will do better in cold weather and POWER drills. In town, there will be the lab, where there will be an extra option &#40;freeze, revive, delete, combine&#41;. The extra option will be to SPLICE your monster&#39;s DNA with another one&#39;s. &#40;They will have to become friends first&#41; Each monster comes with three parts; UPPER: Head to arms, MID: arms to thigh/leg area, and LOWER: from thigh/leg area to end of body. There will also be another categorie known as SPECIAL: any special characteristics a monster posesses, mainly wings or one giant eyeball, or maybe even a stone body. You won&#39;t be able to choose what gets spliced into the final product, but you will be given a rough idea of it.  <BR> <BR>Tourneys are held as normal. There will be a calender in your home or stable &#40;i couldn&#39;t decide which&#41;, and the mail person will come along every month or so with mail telling you the latest fashions for monsters, warnings for strays or wilds, and the current &#34;hot&#34; trainers &#40;winners of recent, big tournaments&#41;. <BR> <BR>Everything will be held on a totally 3d and regular scale format except the map screen. <BR> <BR>Sorry my post was so long. Anything to add, any ideas, comments, or anything? &#40;be nice, please :&#41; &#41;

<I>&#40;take it easy with the flaming, i&#39;m a little 13 year old girl.&#41;</I> <BR> <BR>Two problems with this: <BR> <BR>1&#41; We don&#39;t allow flaming on the site, for you to assume that we do means that you didn&#39;t read the Office of the Mayor. Go back and read it now, or you will be banned from the site. <BR> <BR>2&#41; We don&#39;t grant special dispensations for age. Research is either worthy of being archived, or it gets deleted. Once again, read the Office of the Mayor. <BR> <BR>You seem to be under the impression that Tecmo hasn&#39;t taken suggestions in the past. They do. That&#39;s how some of use got to design rare monsters in MR3 and MR4, and have other suggestions implemented. You might also want to read the E3 Report from May. <BR> <BR>There is a proceedure for submitting real suggestions. Tecmo asks for suggestions on their own forums. They post a message that has a set time limit to it, and will clearly state that they don&#39;t pay, and outline other details about the ownership of the intellectual property.  <BR> <BR>Just like movie studios, they do not read unsolicited emails or unsolicited snail mail because of legal issues involving copyrights and trademarks. Sending them unsolicited material is a waste of time. <BR> <BR>I suggest that if you ever do submit your ideas that you make it clear that you do not in any way represent MRM.  <BR> <BR>Your use of the &#39;we&#39; is pretentious at best, since it implies you are speaking for us as a group &#40;and you most certainly are not&#41;, or that you are using the stuffy imperial &#39;we&#39; reserved for kings, and queens making offical pronouncements. <BR> <BR>There will not be male and female monsters, nor will there be &#40;as you so badly desire&#41; sex in future MR games. Tecmo will not be turning the game into an ESRB &#34;M&#34; rated series. It&#39;s a waste to even suggest such a change in the series.

 Wow, just wow. There are a few things wrong with this: <BR> <BR>1: You&#39;re basing the things you want off of three of the games. Two of which are very old, and one of which was limited due to being on the GBA. <BR> <BR>2: You&#39;re under the impression that Tecmo doesn&#39;t listen to the fans. This wrong on so many levels! Lisa stated very few of the reasons. Not only do they let us have opinions on the rare monsters, but we can give our opinion on which discs these come from &#40;and it DOES happen&#41;. Not only that, but we can raise five monsters at once for a reason. That is just barely dipping into the fan pool suggestion of MR. <BR> <BR>3: Everything you said there...it&#39;s missing something. No, not missing something. It ISN&#39;T something. It isn&#39;t Monster Rancher. Monster Rancher is a raising sim with some RPG elements. What you said would end up turning it into more of an RPG than raising sim. MR is somewhat of a cult game. It has a niche. It has the fans that follow that niche. If you switch the genre, SURE you may have better sales, but Tecmo has given us the gold that is MR style raising sim in six games, and I don&#39;t see them backing out of it now. Sure they may make games in other genres using the MR characters, they&#39;ve done it before, but it&#39;s roots will always be in the raising sim genre.

 I remember throwing around conversations about tag-teaming right before MR3 came out. <BR> <BR>Not in time for MR3, but MR4 had it...

 Jeez guys, give the kid a break, she said she was new! not all of her ideas were bad, breeding does not imply Mature content, nor did she insist on it overmuch. Breeding as opposed to combining is a bit more logical. You might get mad and ban me for saying this, but not everyone is likely to read office of the mayor, or to remember what they read.  However, Friend of Coltia, perhaps you SHOULD check out the rest of the site before posting anything else.

 No breaks. Everyone&#39;s equal here, regardless of age or time spent on the site. Don&#39;t revive dead arguments, this is about two and a half weeks old. <BR> <BR>Perhaps YOU should check the dates of something before you post anything. You don&#39;t have the greatest posting record, so you shouldn&#39;t talk. Don&#39;t act like a moderator and tell people what they should do when <BR>a&#41; Your posts are worse <BR>b&#41; You break a rule when doing so <BR> <BR>This was done. The situation was handled, leave it alone. Thinking before posting, not a new concept.
