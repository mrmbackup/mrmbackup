 I for one have likes and dislikes on the topic of changes. I for one, didn&#39;t personally jump for joy when I saw the &#34;New design&#34; for Hengers in MR3, but I do like the fact that you can change where you ranch. What is your opinion on this topic, what changes did you like? What do you think TECMO could change for your personal liking for future games?

 Also, what would be your new image for changed monsters?

 I liked the cute chibi pictures during training in MR1. In MR2, I liked that you could transfer mosters from MR1 that were already trained to get mosters with higher stats than normal. MR3 wasn&#39;t my favorite, but I liked going to different training spots. <BR> <BR>MR4 was fun because you could go out on adventures, so it was a bit more like the show. &#40;I watched the show and then found out about the games&#41;. You could also interact with your monster&#40;s!&#41; and there were tag-team battles. <BR> <BR>What annoyed me &#40;minorly&#41; about all the games was when a monster that was obviously feminine &#40;Pixies&#41; but were refered to as &#34;him.&#34; I&#39;d actually LIKE to have male and female monsters.

 Trust me, they aren&#39;t getting rid of combining as a man-made laboratory invention and presenting sex to kiddies. <BR> <BR>1&#41; It would limit which monsters could breed with others. People already complain about the limited combination possibilites, restricting it further won&#39;t make anyone happy. <BR> <BR>2&#41; SCEA is very tough about what gets presented in the US in terms of content for E games. Adding sexual mating, even if it happens off camera would cause it to lose the E rating. <BR> <BR>3&#41; The gender thing is one main pillar of Pokemon. Tecmo already suffers a lot because reviewers and the public call the MR games Pokemon knockoffs. Making it more and more like Pokemon won&#39;t help anyone. -Except perhaps Nintendo who could sue for theft of intellectual property. <BR> <BR>I realise that you probably love Pokemon and want tons more Pokemon all the time, but not every game can be Pokemon.

 I HATE Pokemon... <BR> <BR>There happens to be ANOTHER monster game I like, called Dragon Warrior Monsters, which just so happened to be out loooong before Pokemon &#40;or at least long before they used the gender idea&#41; and they used the idea first. It was still rated E, too, if I remember clearly. <BR> <BR>If anything, Pokemon are the knock offs and should be sued. However, this is actually a rather &#34;common&#34; concept now, so I don&#39;t think anyone could sue anyone. <BR> <BR>And if gender is such a &#34;pillar of Pokemon,&#34; then why didn&#39;t they have it in the original games seven years ago when I was a kid and still WAS into that junk? &#40;to put that extremely nicely....&#41; <BR> <BR>And really, please, I may not have been posting for quite a while, but I&#39;m not some kid who just heard about all this. For all I care, the gender of your monster could have a small or indirect effect on it, and they still combine them using the lab or whatnot. I just think it&#39;s a little silly to call pixies &#34;HIM&#34; or &#34;HE.&#34;
