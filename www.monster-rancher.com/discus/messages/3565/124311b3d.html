<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
This project takes preparation, confidence, and will cost $3-$5 per location visited. <BR> <BR>During the time when a new Ranching game is in pre-release, you have a great opportunity to spread the word about it to game retailers, particularly the smaller boutique type shops such as GameStop, Game Crazy, etc. This isn&#39;t as effective in larger big-box places like Best Buy, but feel free to try it there if you are brave.  <BR> <BR>Bigger game companies have sales reps who travel to stores and talk to employees about games that are coming out. They show magazine articles about the games, talk about the features and target audience, and often give small incentives to employees. Tecmo as a company isn&#39;t big enough to hire such reps, but you can act as one if you follow the accepted guidelines. <BR> <BR>Dress presentably, and make sure you are well groomed. You do not want to be famous as &#39;that stinky guy&#39; or &#39;that girl with the stained shirt&#39;. You don&#39;t have to wear a suit, but please remember that you are trying to make a favorable impression on people -and you want them to remember the game, not your odd appearance.  <BR> <BR>Before you go in, arm yourself with: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Any magazine articles, particularly ones with screenshots, about the game. <BR>  <BR>2&#41; Candy: usually Jolly Ranchers and Pixie Stix. The candy is crucial. Every day store employees see several reps pushing games and giving them gifts. They also have to wait on dozens of fanboys talking up their current obsession. To separate yourself from the raving fanboys, and to establish yourself as a wanted presence, always bring candy. Store employees are always hungry, and most reps bring gifts like keychains, which are highly forgettable. They rarely get food gifts, and so, by giving them candy you will be remembered fondly for years to come. I chose Jolly Ranchers in particular because every time anyone mentions them, or your gift, they say the word &#39;Rancher&#39; over and over; it&#39;s subliminal advertising. Pixie Stix, well, point out the ever-popular Pixies in the game. &#40;more on how to distribute the candy later&#41; <BR> <BR>3&#41; The latest info from the web. This includes tentative release dates, game features, when display boxes will arrive in stores, etc. Check MRM for specific topics to cover. As a game release approaches we will provide you with a complete guide with everything you need to know to talk about the game. <BR> <BR><CENTER><B>The Presentation</B> <BR><FONT SIZE="-2">or how to get it done quickly and professionally</FONT></CENTER> <BR> <BR>Walk into and take a look around. If employees are waiting on customers, politely wait until they are done. You do NOT want to interfere with sales. On a few rare occasions, a store may be so busy that you should just leave and return later.  <BR> <BR>Once you have an employee&#39;s attention, smile and introduce yourself. &#34;Hi, I&#39;m -----, and I&#39;m here to let you know about the next Monster Rancher Game: &#40;name of game&#41;&#34; <BR> <BR>Then immediately give them the candy. Tell them this is for them and everyone working today. Don&#39;t make a huge deal about it, move directly into your point for the day.  <BR> <BR>We will be posting talking points here to help you with this, as each new game approaches. Sometimes the point is simply &#34;Did you know a new MR game is coming for the XYZ console?&#34; Other times the point might be &#34;Next week, when you get your display boxes for the MR game, can you make sure to place them prominently?&#34; <BR> <BR>Keep all conversation positive, and about Tecmo and ranching. This is not the time vent about other issues. If you want to complain about how your PS2 broke, or how release dates are wrong, do it on another visit! <BR> <BR>At this point, you probably have a pretty good idea how things are going. If they ask more about the game, talk about it. If they seem distracted or annoyed, don&#39;t press the issue. <BR> <BR>Note: Gamestop stores allow individual store managers very little leeway in displaying unpaid items. Most of their displays have been sent from their home office, where they underwent and approval process that included the company paying a fee. &#40;the fee starts at $200 for an 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; sign&#41; Some managers, particularly those with larger stores and more wall space will take items and display the. Others won&#39;t. Do not press the issue if they say no. Also, allow them to determine where they should place the item. They have rules they need to follow, and we need to respect that part of their job. <BR> <BR>Keep smiling, be direct, and when you are done, thank them and leave. Short and sweet is better than getting into long discussions on topics that may veer off course. Usually a visit takes less than ten minutes. <BR> <BR>When you are done, you&#39;ll get a great sense of satisfaction from representing Ranching, and the next time you visit the store, even if it&#39;s just to shop, you&#39;ll find the employees remember you &#40;candy! this person gave me candy!&#41; and treat you like an insider.
