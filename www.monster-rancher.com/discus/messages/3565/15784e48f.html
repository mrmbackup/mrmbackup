 Ok, as you can plainly see, out MMR section is woefully lacking in information. The goal of this contest is to correct that situation.  <BR> <BR>To enter: post something useful in our MMR section. Generally, you&#39;ll have to post in the Misc. Q&amp;A section and a moderator will move your post to the appropriate area. If you are wondering what to post or how, take a look at the MR2 FAQ section for ideas. &#40;some of the MR2 subsections, like techs and items are also useful&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;Each post will be considered an entry in the contest. That said, we expect posts to be complete as possible. Don&#39;t post something that should be one chart line by line just to up your post count.  <BR> <BR>&#42;Extra entry points will be awarded to longer, more thorough posts -these extra points will go above and beyond just adding lines up. For example, posting info on one tech would get you 1 point. But, if you do an entire chart, completely formatted, for a breed that has, say, 8 techs, you could get 20 points. <BR> <BR>&#42;Don&#39;t post drivel. If I have to, I will create a special trash-heap section &#40;Hall of Shame&#41; for moderators to move entries to if they feel a post is not really informative, redundant, obvious, etc. If the situation gets really bad, I will issue offenders negative points. <BR> <BR>&#42;Use the Formatting Playground in the Cafe section as much as you want to practice making charts, using colors, etc. Do not upload excel files, they are impossible for moderators to edit. Feel free to start lots of new &#39;conversations&#39; in the Playground, we&#39;ll delete anything anyone asks to be deleted. <BR> <BR>&#42;Remember that current resources like the MMR wiki may not always be available. Lots of places that existed when we started out are gone now, along with their resources. We urgently need to build up our MMR section to preserve data for posterity. <BR> <BR>&#42;Contest runs from now until August 1, 2013 midnight Pacific time. <BR> <BR>&#42;Prizes will be awarded to entrants based on an unscientific, secret point system that may be random, biased, quirky and unfair. Arguing with Lisa and the Moderation Team about this will immediately disqualify entrants. <BR> <BR>&#42;Prizes will only be issued to those willing to email or snail mail Lisa Shock their address, AND, who reside in countries where the items are legal. <BR> <BR>&#42;Prizes have no cash value and cannot be exchanged for anything. <BR> <BR>&#42;MRM, Lisa Shock, and the Moderation Team are not responsible for items lost, stolen, damaged, confiscated, impounded, etc. by postal services, delivery carriers, governments, parents, landlords, etc. <BR> <BR>&#42;By entering, contestants agree that MRM, Lisa Shock, and the Moderation Team are not responsible for any emotional distress related to this event. <BR> <BR>&#42;More rules may be added as I think of them.

 Would like to enter but I don&#39;t know anything at all about the game. I haven&#39;t had a chance to play it or even purchase it &#40;no devices that can run it&#41;. <BR>Would be nice to see the section expand though, I&#39;d like to read up on it should I ever get to play it.
