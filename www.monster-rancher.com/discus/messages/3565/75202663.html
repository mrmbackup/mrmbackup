 Wouldn&#39;t that be a nice feature? I read someone&#39;s post about having a Zuum/Dragonwings/Gali mask. And I just though, &#34;Why not design a monster all together?&#34; Granted it would take a lot of memory, and alot of money, but I&#39;d be willing to pay the extra money to watch a tie-dyed dragon with butterfly wings, duke it out with a striped banana mocchi. <BR>You know, different combinations=different moves/stats, much like the randomity of the code reading of the discs. <BR>Hey, if they can put your picture in the game, why not let you design the monster you&#39;re going to train? Heck, why not let us design a likeness of ourselves as the trainer, so it seems like we&#39;re actually doing something instead of an assistant taking up the payroll.. <BR>I&#39;m a greedy person ^^;;

 I love your idea, but i&#39;m worried that it might take the fun out of finding monsters on saucer stones if you could simply make your own. Maybe they could make it so that you could unlock certain features from saucer stones, like the butterfly wings or different kinds of butterfly wings, etc...

 Yeah, that would be interesting. Have every CD give you a monster with 3 &#39;pieces&#39; and a paint job on it. Then, after you&#39;ve completely sorted through your CD library, you can take groups of monsters sorted by main type and switch the &#39;pieces&#39; and paint jobs between them. Have a system that only allows you one piece per area &#40;Nobody can have 3 sets of wings or 4 tails coming out of their behinds etc&#41;. That would make an interesting creation system. Maybe for a large sum you can purchase a new pieces for your monsters. <BR> <BR>Plenty of ideas for this thread.

 Well, I don&#39;t know how you can make an addition to a game, but they could have different sets of the games. The ones that don&#39;t have as many features cost less, but the ones that have more cost more. Also if you buy a cheaper one and then save, then if you brought a more expensive game, you could transfer the data from lesser games so you wouldn&#39;t have to start all over. <BR> <BR> Hmmmm, maybe we could make Zans with dragon wings or something..... Or tigers with wings, too. We could also have.....uh.....

 i think you should unlock monsters like normal and go to the lab and mix those monsters together the way you want them. For instance, you combile a dragon with a suezo, take the dragons head and give it one eyeball add a mew amd give it cat claws and so on. You get the point.

 I think they should just do it like they did in MR2.  The evolution system didnt give enough types of the creatures &#40;2 different jokers just does not work&#41;.

 Design a monster = No <BR> <BR>Mainly because that takes away from the game, in my opinion. It makes it something entirely different, like &#34;Mad Scientist Rancher&#34; <BR> <BR>With such a feature, who would honestly use the regular monsters, and after you got tired of combining them, you&#39;d just toss the game to the side for sure. Where as I still play MR2 today, because I haven&#39;t raised everything yet, much less made great champs out of them. Still got some butt to kick online anyway...

 Oh, sorry. Didn&#39;t know that. I&#39;ll have to check it out sometime and compare it with Monster Rancher. It might take a couple weeks though, as Graffiti Kingdom gets checked out at Blockbuster a lot.

 having the &#34;a custom lab thingy&#34; as an unlockable after you beat the game or if you find something in an adventure would be kind of cool then it would be optional you can play the gam normally shrining and combing but being able to do a custom monster a custom breeder would also be cool

 How about you choose it&#39;s skills, nature, traits, starting stats, excetera for a certain amount of game money! Also what if you could create your own ??? types? That sounds fun to me.

 Speaking of designing a monster there is a game out for GC called Amazing Island in which you draw your monster. You also give it accessories and such to customize. If you want to design your own monster get that game.  <BR> <BR>Jade Cocoon also had a similar thing that combined looks of monsters when combining &#40;#1 not 2&#41;.  <BR> <BR>But as far as monster rancher goes... I think they should have a Mew with a ??? sub type that you can doodle it&#39;s face on kinda like Blanca in AC...
