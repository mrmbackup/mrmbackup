Well, it looks like people ignored those warnings on cup jelly packages, and were giving them to kids, and not chewing them before swallowing. So, apparently they were the subject of a massive recall this summer. Too bad, really, I like them so much! <A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/topics/konjac.html" TARGET="_blank">More Info</A> <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Disclaimer: This site does not endorse the consumption of this horrifically dangerous product.

 Shouldn&#39;t the US law makers have other priorities other than the dangers of ungodly lethal cup jellies. I suppose the cup jellies were actually sent here as a plot to kill american children by Saddam... well, i&#39;m just venting because i&#39;m in a bad mood. But still, this ban of cup jellies is incredibly stupid. I hear they are planning to make lollypops illegal next... I would love to see just who are the proud supporters of the US war on sweets...

 I live up here in the &#34;great north&#34;, and while I&#39;ve never looked for them, I have never actually seen any of those jellies before. But from what I hear it is a good thing they are banning them;I have seen stories on the news several times of people choking to death on those things.

 Well they always had big warnings on them, both to not feed to children under age 5, and to chew them thoroughly....

 Well, Canada&#39;s health associations will gladly ban whatever USA&#39;s assosiations ban since Canada is stricter than USA. <BR> <BR>I mean, Viagra took half a year to enter the Canadian market!

It looks as though Australia had banned these horrid things back in August.  But it dose have some interesting information, such as Geletan based jellies are not part of the ban, in Austalia that is.

 Um, 15 deaths world-wide is a very, very small number. About 10 deaths occur each year in the US alone from children choking on balloons. Yet, every Toys R Us, party shop, discount store, etc. carry them, and people continue to buy them. Most incidences of children choking are cause by food. However, remember that we are talking about a product that is clearly labelled as dangerous to children, but those parents fed them to kids anyway. <BR> <BR>The fact is, the people making cup jellies don&#39;t have powerful lobbyists to help themselves get the sorts of exemptions that other manufacturers routinely get. The number #1 toy that kids choke on, and has been for over a decade, is Micro Machines. But, they are allowed to simply point at their warning label and walk away, because they lobby the legislatures. <BR> <BR>Also, geletain is not an acceptable substitute. It is manufactured with beef and pork, and in many cases is not kosher, and may have a danger of spreading mad cow disease. Not, to mention that simply by not being vegetarian, it is undesirable by a large segment of the world&#39;s population.

 Next thing you know, they&#39;ll be outlawing Strong Glue. Then how will the children put their dolls together?  <BR> <BR>At least I can still buy a pile of meat...
