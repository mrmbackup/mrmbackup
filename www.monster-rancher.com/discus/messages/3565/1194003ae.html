Yesterday, I was suckered into visiting an EZBoard, and the ads there changed my browser&#39;s homepage setting, and loaded over 100 spyware programs onto my computer. It was so bad that the computer spent over 10 minutes booting up with all of these things running. And, even when I was able to re-set my homepage, hundreds of popups appeared when I tried opening my browser, thus making my system effectively useless except as a tool for spyware companies. I spent over 6 hours working on my system to get it back to normal. <BR> <BR>Now I realize that EZBoard is a for-profit company that has employees to pay and a board of directors interested in making sure that shareholders get dividends. I also realize that as an online business, ad revenue is one of the only possible sources of income for them. &#40;They do make some money from subscriptions, more on that later.&#41; However, there is big difference between an advertizement and a delivery system for software intended to hijack a customer&#39;s computer.  <BR> <BR>I know that EZBoard has sites without ads, where the users pay to be a &#39;gold&#39; community. This wouldn&#39;t be so bad except for the fact that their subscription money goes to support the people who decided to allow the agressively invasive ads on the non-&#39;gold&#39; boards. <BR> <BR>I also know that I could view all EZBoard without ads by being a &#39;gold&#39; member. However, I am a very lucky person. I saw this information before they added the advertizing. Now, a new vistor has to be subjected to the onslaught of spyware before they have the privledge of finding their way to the tiny link to information about the &#39;gold&#39; subscription program. If they find the information page, nowhere in that page is there any warning regarding the nature of the &#39;advertizing&#39; on the site. I refuse to become a &#39;gold&#39; member because I do not want to reward the company for deciding to treat new visitors in this manner. <BR> <BR>I find the entire EZBoard business model unconscionable. EZBoard knowingly subjects their new visitors and low-income users to an invasion of their privacy, and alters their computers. -And they are profiting from it! <BR> <BR>I will never visit another EZBoard site again. I am recommending that my friends and family do the same. I know that some of you run EZBoards, and I hope you realize that my refusal to visit your board is not a personal slight. I would, however, encourage you to consider moving your community elsewhere, to a company that treats visitors decently. <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="-2"><I>Feel free to re-post this message online. <BR> I only ask that it be copied in its entirety, so that portions not be viewed out of context.</I></FONT>

 I&#39;ve had a similiar experiance with them, and was also not very impressed. Of course, I wasn&#39;t as good with computers then as I am now. <BR> <BR>Either way, I agree, and personally veiw it as a direct violantion of my privacy. Of course, I would rather just not go the those boards, since I am too busy to look up which law allows them to do this.

 Thanks for the warning. Never heard of EZboards before but have heard lots of sites use that method of mayhem. Makes me certain the world is becoming a mix of 1984 and The Running Man&#40;the book not the movie&#41;. Fellas the only way to keep trash like this from happening more is education and boycotting...&#42;picks up sign&#42; HECK NO WE WON&#39;T POST!

 WOW I have been useing EZboards for years and have never once had a problem like that.  I have virtually no spyware and I run AdAware often enough to notice if I did and where I was getting it from.  Also I never had it change my brouser before &#40;but that may be cause I am on aol and dont use internet explorer or netscape&#41;.  I know the one I am an admin on is add free.  So, I cant say I ever had a problem with them before.  And I esily visit around 10-15 ezboard boards.

 Thanks, mp! <BR> <BR>To fiffa, you are really lucky. I use some spyware eliminating software that gives some protection, but I don&#39;t use a popup blocker because I need to see certain popup situations. &#40;I had also run adaware and virusscan about 20 minutes prior to the visit, so I know my sytem was clean.&#41; I use both Netscape and IE, so I can view how well MRM looks and acts in comparison to other sites. &#40;We also have a Linux machine in the house.&#41; Yes, I got nailed in IE, however, if the site had responsible people running it, it wouldn&#39;t matter what browser I used. You don&#39;t have anything like that happen at oh, say, Monster-Rancher-Metropolis.com, or CNN.com. My real point here is the overall ethics of the people running the EZBoard business as a whole. They should not be subjecting groups of their users to this sort of treatment. I just wanted everyone to know what is happening to their friends, peers, and colleagues at EZBoards.

 Hmm i know a lot of EZboards that are untouched. <BR>Ad-Aware by the way does NOT block pop ups. It just cleans trackers, data miners, and spam cookies and the such. <BR> <BR>Most of the crap you must have gotten from EZboards comes from the people using and editting them. You really cant blame the board, but the people using it.

 Something I found that might be related: <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;m noticing that some malicious spyware and worse has been slipping through our third party ad code lately. Some of this code may even change your default homepage. It never seems to impact any of the PCs I use, so it is hard for me to track it down. I&#39;m not sure what the difference is between the computers I use and the computers that fall victim to malicious ad code. <BR> <BR>I just want everyone to know that we don&#39;t intentionally run these ads, nor do we profit from them. The way our ads work is this: We run third party ad code so that outside ad companies can sell the space on Newgrounds. If an ad company has the chance to sell 1 million impressions per day, but they can only fill half of that with ads, they will basically &#34;subcontract&#34; the other 500,000 spaces to another third party advertiser who has inventory to fill the space. <BR> <BR>What ends up happening is, one of those third party of a third party advertisers decides to slip in some extra &#34;fun&#34; code, and hopes no one will trace it to them. It is hard to catch them, because no legitiment ad company wants to think malicious code is coming from their ad server. <BR> <BR>It is also becoming very difficult because I can&#39;t seem to keep certain advertisers OFF the site. For example, one advertiser owes us for payments dating back to September 2003. They pay on a three month delay &#40;like most ad companies&#41;, so it isn&#39;t until January that we realize we aren&#39;t getting checks anymore, and from there they are already four months behind. I removed their ad early this week, to negotiate getting caught up with payment. Within days later, the ad re-appeared on the site via a third party. The third party ad guys may be waiting three months to find out they won&#39;t get paid either. <BR> <BR>Other times, unscrupulous advertisers will offer a lot of money to run ads that I consider too over-the-top or malicious. I&#39;ll turn them down, only to see the ad running on the site days later - only instead of getting the 100% payment, I&#39;m just getting 50% from a third party... Or worse... The third party is getting 50% from another third party, and I&#39;m getting 50% of that. You can see why we have to run so many ads just to cover hosting expenses, because it trickles down through so many companies in-between. Everyone takes a piece on the way to our bank account.&#34; <BR> <BR>This is a mod from newgrounds.com <BR> <BR>Like he said, third party memebers have a quota. So, if they are running behind, it would make sense to flood some places. I&#39;m not positive that the EZ board is the same way, but it sounds like it to me.

 Thanks, CHB! <BR> <BR>That makes a lot of sense. I just wish these people would find a way to stop it all -somehow to only deal with advertizers directly or something. If sites become unusable, well, people will stop using them. &#40;ad revenue is ultimately about numbers of eyeballs....if the eyeballs aren&#39;t there, neither is the ad revenue&#41;

 In two years of using it, I&#39;ve never really had a problem with Ezboard. Granted some of their ads have been rather bad. But the truly awful ones don&#39;t stick around for long. <BR> <BR>Now the real question here is what the Ezboard you went to was for. If it was a link from somebody you don&#39;t know then it was most likely not EZboard that was responsible for what happened to your computer.

 oh yeah I know adaware does not block popups, I have aol set to do that.  And lisa, WOW you got a lot of stuff runnin over there.  heehee <BR>Its wonderful that you have the ethics to keep MRM clean and free of popups and whatnot.  I wasnt saying that NO ezboard forum was like that, just as you had said, I am lucky in the fact that I never ran into that problem.   <BR>Honestly, I hate all the banner adds and popups and all that nonsence all over the internet.  But unfortunatly this is the sociaty we live in, where you cant even go to an arena without it being named after some company with adds all over the place.

 Ads pay for things. Without advertising, tons and tons of things wouldnt exist.  <BR>Honestly, i wouldnt mind having a banner atop of a page or so on this site if it meant it helped pay for things.
