 Okay before you dismiss this as just another lame game pitch, think about it. <BR>What does Super Smash Bros Melee got going for it? <BR>Characters <BR>Levels <BR>unlockables <BR>Multiplayer <BR> <BR>This is how it would work. Scince im pretty sure you can copyright only characters, not a battle style it would be alright to use the % of being knocked out. Now this may sound lame, but face it SSBM pretty much figured out the best arena battle system. <BR> <BR>For characters you have the base monsters <BR>Golem, mocchi, suezo, durahan ect. <BR>Youd start with 10. the more tournaments you play the more characters you unlock. Up to tigers, psi-rollers even. <BR>For alternate costumes you use sub breeds. Tiger/Dragon, Durahan/Golem. <BR>At least 6 sub breeds of each monster, this is no problem considering the MR2 combining. Secret costumes can be the ??? breeds, like Gold Suezo or Blue Pheonix. <BR> <BR>Unlockables would be the Cards, or Encyclopedia pages you get by either the Tournaments or the Lottery thing like in SSBM. think about it over 400 cards could be found. <BR> <BR>Levels wouldnt be a problem. Kawrea, The farm, Torbles, the Tournament arenas themselves. <BR>It all works out perfect.

 I forgot to talk about the tourneys themselves. <BR>youd have E through S class difficulty. Beating one tourney with a character would unlock its secret sub breed. <BR> <BR>As for the battles themselves, Dragons and Golems would be the heavy weight hitters, pixies would be the light fighters, mocci and tiger the medium weight well balanced ones. <BR>Moves arent a problem, theres enough variety in the MR series to easily carry over the ideas. <BR>Mochis roll would be Forward &#43; Square. <BR> <BR>And think how much better it would be using the PS/Ps2 controller, the best controller ever designed.

 I haven&#39;t played hop-a-bout. But this kinda takes away from what monster rancher is, doesn&#39;t it? <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t get me wrong, if there are two things I hope they have in MR4, its Battle Royals and Tag Team matches &#40;I think this one is possible with some of the shots I&#39;ve seen.&#41; <BR> <BR>and don&#39;t be nervious about posting ideas, just don&#39;t expect them to be likely, or even liked. People just have different tastes.

 Well hop-a-bout was pretty popular &#40;by MR standards&#41; and Battle cards is a succesful &#40;relativly&#41;&#34;spin off&#34; i guess you would call it. it would be just another leap into a different Genre <BR> <BR> and i wasnt nervous, its just a lot of times when people post ideas it isnt thought out very well and basically consists of <BR>&#34;OMG they shuld mak a game were dey FIGHT OMG!!1&#34; <BR> <BR>Not that that happens here a whole lot, it just has to be thought out.

 Yeah after seeing pokemon in SSB and SSBM, you&#39;d think it&#39;d be a great platform for mr2, but it was a nintendo idea, so THEY surely wouldn&#39;t make something like it. <BR> <BR>But then you lose the concept of it being a ranching simulation &#40;Which made MR what it is today&#41; and becomes a fighter.  I&#39;d rather have it as a ranching simulation.

 It could have both. Normal ranching with the fighting thing as a mini game or something&#40;a very large one&#41;.

 I think adding a SSBM like mini-game would be a bit  <BR>complicated. You would have to chose powers, monsters,  <BR>sub-breeds, make unlockables and their costumes, and you  <BR>would have to find new comtrols for things like jumping  <BR>and ducking. I don&#39;t think monster rancher would do that.  <BR>They might have gone a bit more towards the action genre,  <BR>but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll go towards SSMB.

 Well the problem is they need to expand the MR universe, and get it out of its niche its in.  <BR>Hop a Bout was arguably a breakout game, that was pretty decent for what it was. <BR> <BR>So maybe the next step is expanding it into a fighter. Not a real Soul Calibur fighter i guess, but the more stategy/moves/character kind of Super Smash Brothers. The formula works so well.

 IMO, I think that if they made it into something like The Unholy War &#40;great love it or hate it type game!&#41;, then it would be cool!

 Err... expand the MR universe and get it out of the niche it&#39;s in?  Why do they need to do that?

 It is the only game in its niche, after all.

 You may have a point, about the niche and stuff, _but_, it was originally a PSX game, expanded into a whole new series on a whole new system, originally a raising game with fighting on the side, spun off into a fighting game with raising on the side to fight better, and a bunch of other variants on other games. It doesn&#39;t need to expand. It can just &#42;&#42;BANG&#42;&#42; and &#42;&#42;WHOOSH&#42;&#42; and here&#39;s a new game, like with both MRA titles, HAB, and Battlecard.
