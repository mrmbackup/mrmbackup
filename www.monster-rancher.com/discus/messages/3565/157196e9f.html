 What would be your concept for the next generation of Monster Rancher Game? Here is my concept: <BR> <BR>The game should: <BR> <BR>1. Revive the training system of MR1 and MR2. This is the game system that captured me to play the whole monster rancher series. MR3 and MR4 were good but what I really missed was watching my monsters grow and how they react with how I raise them &#91;it always makes me giggle when Suezo laughs in MR2&#93;. The multiple monster training in MR4 is also good but they should revamp it. It just feels so cramped when you are raising 5 monsters, advance scheduling them to train with limited gadgets on a limited space on your farm. I personally would just like to have the one-monster on farm style. Three is manageable. But five? too much. <BR> <BR>2. Revive the combining system of MR2 which in my opinion was a great addition to the MR1. Although complex, it really did make raising/training challenging and combining more worthwhile &#91;especially if you&#39;re gonna combine two of your best monsters&#93; <BR> <BR>3. The Monster Encyclopedia. Saves time from shrining specific discs for specific monsters. It would be safer to your console too. <BR> <BR>4. Have all the Monsters of MR1, MR2, MR3, MR4, MRDS, and MR online. Yes! I mean all the monsters that were phazed out &#91;Hopper, Worm, Gali, Abyss,Falco, Piroro, Xenon, Garu, Ape, Ghost, Metalner, Undine, Niton, Mock, Wracky, Dino, Bajarl, Gaboo and GALI!!&#93; I was disappointed to find out that there was no Worm in MR4. I mean i do realize that they might have all evolved into Beaclon. But come on! I WANT THEM ALL BACk.With a few upgrades in their skill list of course. <BR> <BR>5. Stat/Overdrive system of Monster Rancher DS. this was surprisingly a great addition. Exceeding the 999 limit to 1500 with a cap stat of 5994 to any monster is AWESOME! Because now you can have a variety of strengths and weaknesses for each monster. The only problem with a 999 all max stats monster is in PVP battle. No such strengths or weaknesses which means a really dull battle. Stat Overdrive solves this problem, greatly. <BR> <BR>6. Adventure and Battle system of MR4. The addition of counter was great and especially beneficial for more defense inclined monsters. Learning a technique is also good because it uses a level up system which is in my opinion was greater than the errantry system. Adventures were also more fun to play because of the &#34;free-to-explore&#34; concept and wild battles. <BR> <BR>7. Greater graphics. Though not much important to gameplay, additional details to the appearances of monsters, especially the sub-breeds is nice to see. <BR> <BR>8. More challenging tourneys. Yes! Because seriously, from all the Monster Rancher series, the hardest monster I have ever battled was Oakleyman &#91;Gaboo/Gaboo&#93; Class E fom Monster Rancher 2!! I beat MR3, MR4 and MRDS easily because MR2 has trained me into a veteran. They should really put more challenge to the rivals. Or a really extreme version of &#34;Legend Cup&#34;. <BR> <BR>Well that&#39;s all for now. What do you think?

 Keep in mind if they had all the monster types that&#39;s a huge amount of monsters they&#39;d have to plan out for, and we&#39;d probably get few subtypes. <BR> <BR>The reason is all pixie types have the same animation, so subtypes are relatively easy to make. <BR> <BR>However, each different monster main breed has different animations so that&#39;d be a problem. <BR> <BR>Mind you I&#39;d like to see Undine and Mock make a return but unless they had a huge budget it might not be doable. <BR> <BR>I also didn&#39;t like raising multiple monsters at once in 4 and 5. Made progress feel so slow. MR 4 is the only one I never one the final tournament on, and 5 didn&#39;t even have a tournament. <BR> <BR>Of course, I&#39;d definitely agree with the places you sited MR2. That was the pinicale of the series in my opinion. <BR> <BR>I also think monsters growing up again would be great, so be very young and then be adults. <BR> <BR>Aim a little less at little kids too. I imagine more adults play this then kids in the US at least. Dunno about Japan.

 Well, as for the issue of large numbers of mains and not having many subs that&#39;s easier to fix then you might think. <BR> <BR>MR6 &#40;or whatever they call it&#41; launches on ps3.  A couple months later offer a downloadable pack of 4 additional monsters.  A couple months after that put out another one.  This way they can charge a small fee for what shouldn&#39;t be too much work &#40;as the subs for those breads would have the same animations&#41; and make some money.  Also keep the game going with the additions spread out. <BR> <BR>And I would LOVE to see Undine back &#40;not the pixy sub bread, the actual monster&#41;.  Mock was cool as well.  GHOST!  So many good monsters left behind.  Zilla, Jill, gaboo..... so many... <BR> <BR>I agree with the limiting the number of monsters to raise.  It gets to be way to much and I wasn&#39;t overly fond of it.  2.. ok not so bad.  5 was just crazy...

 Budget wouldn&#39;t be a problem for them because DOA, FAtal Frame and Ninja Gaiden is doing epically on their respective consoles. <BR> <BR>And I believe that a really great upgraded game of Monster Rancher on the new PS3 would really boost their sales on the series.

 They can limit the sub-breeds of course, but just enough to have a variety of stat gains and orders on their baseline stats.

 Although I&#39;m a great fan of the series, and somehow  <BR>a postive person, I don&#39;t think KOEI-Tecmo will  <BR>invest in a new MR console game &#40;not at the near  <BR>future&#41;. <BR> <BR>Their main focus, now, seems to be on the Warrior  <BR>series, and all the spin-offs &#40;like that One Piece  <BR>Warrior thing&#41;

 I think if the game &#34;Wrath of the White Witch&#34; &#91;a new monster-sprite type raising game for ps3&#93; would be a hit, I think Tecmo-Koei would reconsider.  <BR> <BR>Pokemon is doing great. <BR>Digimon is planning for a comeback with an upgrade of Digimon World one on PSvita. <BR> <BR>I wish MOnster Rancher would have the opportunity to shine with these games again.

 You know, it seems very possible to have a Poke&#39;mon and MOnster Rancher Spin-off. Since they&#39;ve been connected somewhat with their producer Tecmo-Koei and their game Nobunaga&#39;s Ambition. <BR> <BR>They do have similar patterns and style for their character and monster design.

 Digimon World upgrade was already released in Japan  <BR>for the PSP. Don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to hit the  <BR>States, as Digimon handhelds don&#39;t do too well here  <BR>either

 Well I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a rumor or not but I read that the new Digimon game will be released internationally on a more later date, but it will be on the Ps Vita. <BR> <BR>Sure enough, a new Monster Rancher game could only be released on the PS handhelds if ever they think of a new way for shrining monsters. MRDS did have a great shrining system but way too inconsistent.

 It seems the new digimon game will be based off the first  <BR>anime series digimon adventure and the first movie Children&#39;s  <BR>war game. And it looks like an international release to  <BR>celebrate 15th anniversary of the original series :&#41; <BR> <BR>But there hasn&#39;t been a console game for digimon or MR in so  <BR>long :&#40; <BR>I really wish there was more fan base to these games because  <BR>Pokemon is similar over and over. We need variety :P <BR> <BR>MR for the ps3 and 360 excites me greatly. The idea.

 &#42;waves to Subster&#42; LTNS!  <BR> <BR>Yes, I think a new shrining system needs to be worked out. It can&#39;t be too easy, though. I think one of the big draws of the console games was seeing what monsters your CDs made, and how you couldn&#39;t just access every type.

 Yes. The shrine system is completely unique to MR and definitely one if its reatest weapons against its rivals. <BR> <BR>The problem is that the newest consoles don&#39;t actually need cds.

 The Digimon world english release is news to me.  <BR>Also, I think our first goal should be getting MR  <BR>onto the PSN classics on the PS3. It&#39;s kind of sad  <BR>that stupid Disney games are getting onto there and  <BR>not Monster Rancher. Surprisingly Digimon World  <BR>1/2/3 isn&#39;t available either

 Well, playing through all the Monster Rancher Games. I would like to add a few points and suggestions. <BR> <BR>9. A great storyline. MR4 did have the beginnings of a great storyline, but I wish it was longer. Or at least have side missionS of some sort to unlock a monster. Unlocking training Gadgets was Fun though. <BR> <BR>10. MORE Unlockable and Secret Monsters. I love unlocking monsters on the MR1 and MR2 series, especially the Beaclon and Scribble. I was saddened to experience that there are only 4 unlockables on the MR4 &#91;including mocchi?&#93;. <BR> <BR>I was thinking what if the 5 main monsters &#91;mocchi, suezo, tiger, hare, golem&#93; were locked in the beginning and you have to compete in an IMA cup for them, and then FIMBA cup would unlock &#91;henger, WORM!!!, mew, and gali&#93;, you get my drift?  <BR> <BR>11. Speaking of IMA/FIMBA cups, how about a Tourney where you can fight all the champions/breeders of MR1-MR4 series right? And a special feature cup that when you insert/transfer &#91;if possible&#93; your save file from MR1/MR2 to the newest game and you fight the Monsters you have in the &#34;Hall of Fame&#34;. &#62;_&#60;

 @Zercker <BR> <BR>Well,because Disney does have an insane amount of money,and more money to come because of the Kingdom Hearts Franchise. <BR> <BR>I kinda wish that there was a partnership that was formed between Tecmo-Koei and Gamefreak, so that there is a possibility of funding the MR series.

 Hey Lisa yes it&#39;s been a while!! :&#41; <BR>Can never let such a great place go. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s nice thinking about a new game, kinda like thinking what would  <BR>you do if you wont the lottery heh. <BR> <BR>But ya MR on the PSN would spark great nostalgia for many no  <BR>doubt.

 Although I&#39;d love a complete monster roster &#40;even if it meant losing out on subs&#41;, it&#39;d be too crazy daunting at the same time.  I&#39;d rather see most of the significant breeds return, along with a few popular ditched ones &#40;Worm especially&#41;, then have ALL of the ??? types. <BR> <BR>Plus it&#39;d be awesomely convenient if the new shrine option used stored files on your ps3 &#40;music, video, game saves, etc&#41; to generate monsters. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also a fan of the total skill cap. In many ways, MRDS was one of the best versions to date although I hate, hate, hated their anti-save scumming method. <BR> <BR>Challenge/difficulty is a mixed bag. I completed most, if not all of MR2, but had trouble with some of MRDS&#39;s later opponents.  Given that at least a portion of the game is devoted entirely to luck, they&#39;d need to overhaul certain elements before they could legitimately claim difficulty.
