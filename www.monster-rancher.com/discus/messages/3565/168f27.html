 And what about on the adventures, when the monster actually searches the structure, turning it into a randomly generated 1st person dungeon, so that it shows the monster actually walking through the halls, or whatever the structure is,....   and/or allowing you to actually control whether the monster goes left/right, forward/backward

 A slightly more serious suggestion. How about if every two hundred years or so, you are forced to retire to the Old Ranchers Home and your son takes over as trainer back at rank 0. Your assistant would also be forced to retire and her daughter would be forced to run the ranch. <BR> <BR>OR... Your assistant could leave every 50 years and you would have to get used to a new way of training over and over and OVER again. };&#93;

 1.How about this idea,...   Instead of combining the monsters, why not breed them instead, so you could use the same parents over and over again or in different matches?? that way, you wouldnt lose it entirely,  but once they have stared breeding, they are not in shape to battle anymore,. and go to a new area on the ranch: the breeding pen. <BR>2.and how about actually telling us when they have reached different stages in develpment ie. &#34;It is getting bigger&#34;

 A couple of practical suggestions: <BR> <BR>1&#41;  Bring back the ability to &#34;buy in bulk&#34; like in MR1.  Having to buy one item at a time is for the birds, and it&#39;s escpecially annoying if you use a lot of items, like me. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Use external means to store monster data for the freezer and Hall of Fame &#40;i.e.  Store on memory card instead of RAM&#41;.  This should allow for virtually unlimited freezer and hall of fame space.  Hey, you can always buy more memory cards.  The same cannot be said for Playstation RAM.

 You should get DNA capsules in the english version and mix monsters with more than one monster. Like a Tiger mixed with a durahan to have armor, and mixed with a pheonix so it would have a bird head and wings. Then it&#39;d look sort of like an armored griffin. Or at least hav a griffinish monster.

 I say more items and monsters. I would personally enjoy the creatures NOT having the same body structure. Make their sizes differant according to the sub-breed. I would love to see a new monster resembling Bahumat or a Hydra. <BR> <BR> <BR>CHB <BR> <BR>P.S. According to legends and myths...arn&#39;t dragons supposed to live a long time?

 Yes that has been a huge peeve of mine dragons being so short lived. in myths they are said to be either imortal or over a thousand years old. and what happened to proto the henger/gali!? he kicked ass, the henger should get his MR1 long life span back&#40;I.E. average of 7 years&#41; and wile the are at it make a demon monster. a sub could be the durahan to make a demonknight demon/durahan or durahan/demon either way would work for me.hehe make a monster that is huge and smart instead of huge and dumb. call it a demon yea make the demon huge and intl based. all kinds of fire moves like Demon Fire, fire breath, fire beam yada yada.. I&#39;m done now.

 Well, there was no colt in Monster Rancher 1.... <BR> <BR>I&#39;d agree though that it&#39;d be kinda neat to either be able to choose a helper based on learning a bit about them,and choosing them, or even getting assigned one of a few different helpers based on your answers to the beginning questions, instead of having one helper changed around to fit every personality?

 WOW... its been a while since l have been to this thread,.  but I have to say that I love all of the ideas for pheonix breeds and sub-breeds, cause l mean,. c&#39;mon, there is really no point in raising the birds when all they combine with is a durahan.  But what a durahan it is........  ok back to the topic,..  here are a few suggestions I have kinda formulated <BR> <BR>&#60;&#60;Why not have certain stat gains&#40;like additional &#43;1&#39;s on trainings/erranties/expeditions&#41; that are given to certain elements attributed to teh monster,... like zillas. undines, and nitons,. possibly even jells,. should recieve an additional &#43;1 on the swimming drill, since they are water types,..  <BR> <BR>&#60;&#60; And on erranties,..  make a sort of tree effect when being succesful and goign to different areas,..   for example,  the first week of an erranty should always be the same trial,.  but then the next week, have two different possibilities of of trials,.  and the following week, two more options for each of those previous trials.  So that by the fourth week, there are 8 different settings and trials that the monster might have to complete,....  mind you, it is still one trial per week,..  but it would just be nice to see some variety&#40;after 92 years of training&#41; <BR> <BR>&#60;&#60; going back to the elemental bonus,...  should there also be a seasonal bonus??  like jills reciving higher stats in winter???   and hares getting a plus 10 on easter???   or just in spring?? <BR> <BR> <BR>all of this is to try and make the next version of this game a little more complex, since I think that all of us seem to enjoy things that are difficult

I had one idea while dreaming that I thought would be a ton of fun: Have the &#39;opening through CD&#39; method for szome monsters, but not too many of them. The rest, you have to find and capture on an expedition, to add to your stable. You know: go out, beat up the bunny that you found in , and stick it in your freezer to train later.  <BR> <BR>Maybe make it the only way yuo can get some critters. Or make &#39;rares&#39; like the enemy monsters.

But... how bout main type griffon, and a main type unicon. And deffinately a lot more ColorPandora types, so it&#39;d be like they discovered more, because when u get it, they say it is a new type.

 I agreee about Color Pandora species needing more combinations to combine with, but as for the Green Twig...Can you imagine that?!?  How long do oyu think it&#39;d live? &#42;ROTFL&#42;  My personal guess is around 20 years easy.  It&#39;s a good idea, but due to the unfair life advantage, it either would be reduced to incredibly low stat gains all its&#39; life, or it would be removed form the game.  Seriously though, I like the ideas, keep&#39;em coming! Who knows, the idea of today, may be the monster of tomorrow...well, it&#39;d take a little longer than tomorrow, technically, but still...-_^

 I want Dino back! Dinos were so much cooler than Zuums. magic was cool too.If they need to take away some monsters, they should get rid of Mocchi and Gaboo. Some poeple think that Monol should go but it makes pretty cool monsters like Evil Hare, Clay, Black Dino, etc.

 How about being able to have your trainer being able to have a sepatrate item list,  that will help the trainer to ........ train better.    <BR>mind you, this list will not be able to have items sold out of it,.. but say that you could send a monster on an erranty or expedition, and brought back a special item... well this lets you train easier,.. like it lets your monster recognize who is the boss!!! <BR>sort of like the hero/heel badge idea <BR> <BR> <BR>And hey,...  has anyone given any thought to how they are gonna facilitize the slate function???? <BR>Cause it would be soooo nice if they would go ahead and expand the slating function to give you at least half of the original&#39;s stats,... or if not the stats,... then some kind of benefit to slating them over,...  cause as is,.. it only unlocks a few ???  monsters,  and for me, it filled in a few holes on my own cd list,...

 And also,...  I just thought of this,. has anyone given thought to story??  <BR>I mean, MR1 was on one continent, adn MR2 is on a separate one,   but still on the same world,.. do you think they will have more to do with metalner in the next game??   like have an invasion or something, and a way to redeem the planet with a battle,..or some other kind of contest. <BR> <BR>Either that,  or possibly make a moon type monster,..  named...  i dunno,....  Lunar??? <BR> <BR>&#60;&#60;And as I was writing these, I came up with the idea,...    they should instead of looking like the main monster type of Lunar,.  they should be the Lunar alien&#39;s interpretation of this world&#39;s monsters,..  but have the traits of Lunar.. <BR>And I picture the Lunar monster to look like the typical, grey skinned alien,. as seen on Fox&#39;s &#34;The X Files&#34;.    and so all of the sub-types should have that same eye structure,..  the kind of teardrop eyes,...   but they should all look alien in nature anyway. <BR>I know it sounds like a sub type, but hey, there should always be one outcast type of idea, right?? But anyways,.. with the Lunar idea,.. if there is some kind of an invasion using the metalner species,.. then maybe the reward of the battle is that the Lunars come to earth and visit, and allow you to breed their versions of our monsters. <BR> <BR>1. Lunar/Pixie.......Moon Sprite <BR> <BR>2. Lunar/Tiger.......Werewolf <BR> <BR>3. Lunar/Monol.......Ith <BR> <BR>4. Lunar/Hengar......Droid <BR> <BR>5. Lunar/Durahan.....Moon Knight <BR> <BR>6.

 I like Zuum more than Dino, personally.  It&#39;s a contest between a velociraptor and Barney...I mean, come on!  But I do agree that all the MR1 monsters should return in the sequel &#40;Magic, Disc, and ESPECIALLY Doodle&#41;.  Also, if you&#39;ve noticed, Slated monsters do carry over their source&#39;s stats to about the same degree that a second-gen monster born from them would have.  In other words, max-out a monster in MR1, and you&#39;ll have a friggin&#39; GOD in the second one.  I just wish there could be some technique carry-over.

 Know what I&#39;d really like to see in the next game? Really? <BR> <BR>A&#41; An &#34;evaluation shop.&#34; A place that, for money &#40;and maybe given time for research, etc.,&#41; can give you various levels of hints about any item in the game. I mean really... why bother putting in all these various and useful items, if no one is ever going to use them, because no one has &#42;any&#42; hint about what they actually do? And how many of the things found out about the items and displayed on this board &#42;would&#42; have been found out without some major ingenuity, and a gameshark? <BR> <BR>B&#41; A tavern &#40;or maybe soda joint if Tecmo understandably wants things geared a bit more toward younger gamers, or even a cafe&#41;. Basically, this would be a place where, possible for a small cost &#40;like buying someone a drink&#41;, or with some other variables, you could find out rumors, and thus get &#42;some&#42; hint of where/how/when to get some of the monsters, or even what is there to find in the first place. I mean honestly, hands up, how many people would get, say, a beaclon, or mock, in the game as it stands now without coming on here and actually finding things out? <BR> <BR>And for another small thing, it&#39;d be nice if we could choose a character sprite for &#34;yourself&#34; and actually see it used once in a while, or a character portrait even , or what have you. I mean, Colt is a trainer&#39;s assistant, supposedly, and a kid, and just basically learning from you... but she does everything! When the monster goes on an errantry, she goes with it, while you the trainer sit at home and just twiddle your thumbs or whatever. When the monster needs rested, Colt tells you. When the monster gets fed, it&#39;s Colt that tells Joy to go feed it. When the monster has a birthday, Colt sings to it and feeds it a cake &#40;that she probably bakes herself or something.&#41; Colt prompts you to praise the monster. Colt prompts you to scold the monster. Sheesh.

 I just had another thought, and I may get shot down or abused for it, but its something that is just an idea.  How about some of the monsters being able to evolve if you do the tight things in the game. Now I know it is sounding like digimon or pokemon, but one of the rare monsters in Mr2 that I found the most fun to unlock was the Beaclon. So I dunno, maybe make worms able to become a few different monsters.  Like the spider creature alluded to earlier in this post. it has already displayed having thin arachnid-like legs.

 or maybe the Durahan can evolve to a durahan II.  With completely separate sub-types, that you cannot achieve with regular durahans, ie a Durahan/Wracky, &#40;a Disturbed Knight&#41; or a Durahan/Zuum &#40;a Chainmail &#40;you know green chainmail.....never mind&#41;&#41;  <BR> <BR>Or even stranger types, such as a Durahan/Centaur, or possibly even harder to imagine, a Durahan/Ape,..  lol, with a banana shaped sword

 Ok, again, i had another idea.  What about having more cool sub-breeds for basic type of monsters???  I mean golem, zuum/dino, and pixie have such subs as wracky, and mock, and durahan.

 Personaly I think so far the people at tecmo have done well in making monster rancher. I look forward to seeing new monsters and better graphics to back it up. since this is suggestions how ever I think you should make a few different Moo type monsters. Then throw in a few hundred more monsters and you&#39;ll be set for a year or to. Best of luck Tecmo.

 The background music is not bad if you listen to it for 30 minutes; after that, it becomes torture. Option to choose background music from a selection would be nice &#40;if this will take up too much disc space, just the option to turn it off&#41;.  <BR> <BR>How about a quick save/quick load feature, where the memory slot is predetermined at the start of the game and it will take only one click to reset.

 I think that too many new monsters seems more confusing. Maybe just a couple legendary ones, or say one that was bred lots and has now been considered a pure breed. But I do think that every monster should have all sub-types. Instead of certain monsters like Phoenix having 2 &#40;3 if ya count that Blue one&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think that instead of creating more and bigger things, they should take what they have and create a more diverse and complex raising moethod, so you can become closer to your monsters.

 What&#39;s wrong with more monsters? I&#39;ll make the game more complex and when you&#39;ve finished getting <BR>all the breeds,it will take about, I dunno, 1000 years? that experience would make the player feel, <BR> I dunno, good? besides,the experience he/she got would make him/her a better player. Anyway,here are some more sub breeds: <BR> <BR>walnut&#40;bomb/kato&#41; <BR> <BR>skull&#40;bomb/joker&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry i couldn&#39;t think of more sub breeds because now,i am having a mental block.Damn i&#39;m stupid!!!!!

 There nothing wrong with more monsters, as long as it&#39;s not the only change. All by itself, it&#39;s not really an improvement. For me, the game is not about the number of monsters there are, it&#39;s what you do with them. That game is called Pokemon.

 That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying PT... I don&#39;t think that more monsters would improve it... but it wouldn&#39;t really bring it down either. <BR> <BR>As I said, I just want a more diverse raising thing.

 How about more expiditions.Instead of three people that ask you if you wanna go with them to the same place every 3 months. <BR>ex. <BR>Space:You travel with Jhon Young to Space and youre base is a satilite the monster travels in a space ship and you can explore planets&#40;this sort of makes up for the buildings&#41; and you can discover metlaners of secret breeds and every secret breed you discover the contenent representitaves or whatever they are called will give you a whomping 10,000G Items you will find will be things like Meteorites,metlaner disk chips,moon rocks,space dust&#40;sells for like 500G&#41;,space scrap&#40;use when combining to get a 15% chance of one of youre already discoverd&#34;secret metlaners&#34; and other things <BR>Under ground:You go with &#40;or shall i say colt goes with&#41;a random explorer&#40;sometimes rovest,sometimes Karavo,exc.&#41;You go in search of the legendary&#34;giant hopper&#34; youre base will be above ground and youre monster will travel with a construction cap on &#40;o&#124;:&#41; it of course will have a light on therer will be many rocks and boulders to explore that have openings and many of them are still inhabited with hoppers some will  flee fron the sight of you&#39;re monster others will surender and give you an item others will get in a fight&#40;they K.O easily and give you meat witch refreshes yer monsters energy by 25&#41; but you will only find the hopers if youre monsters goes into the center of the boulder&#40;the center leads to a dead end in witch a monster will be found at the end and youre monster will bring it out of the cave to show you&#41; the hoper king is located in the verry bottom level&#40;it has 10 floors to explore&#41; where there will be a golden hopper statue but when you try to explore it kicks you&#39;re monster to the wall taking off some of its lif&#40;in battleing lif that is&#41; this is the king hopper or aka&#34;giant hopper&#34; if you defeat it it will send you one bar of gold every month for a year this map has no items in it except for fish bones and boots and sticks witch is why the prize in the end is so good. <BR>ok last one &#42;yawn&#42; <BR>Catacombs:must be  rankk S or higers mucs have lif over 700 this map it the hardest it&#40;as some of you may know about it&#41; has many dead ends it is like under ground but it is build up with walls over a million years ago you need to find out how this happend &#40;you go with rovest by the way&#41; becuase if you loose youre flash light then you are hopeless no way out is is a giant giant maze that goes hunderds of feet under ground&#40;some even say it is the gate way to hell!&#41;it is full of bones piles of them millions of em!well you have to get to the verry bottom of it where you discover a giant red door alas!!!! the rumors are true!!! you can then discover the bomes you are standing on you can keep them they will each have a name&#40;like hopper bone&#41;you can use to combing to get a hopper with every stat at 300 but it will never obey and always cheat becuase the bone is cursed! so after you discover 5 bones you discover that rovest!!!!ROVEST HAS DISSAPEARED!!! and who was it standing next to you?well who else???you figure it out so... rovest was really...really...really...HIM!!! You hear a voice from behind not rovest it is karavo!!! he comes in youre site and... ig to to go:&#40; ill tell later bye!!!

 I think to help make battles work in 3D you could design not a &#34;move bar&#34; but a &#42;&#42;Move SPHERE&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>This would actually be a shpere with little empty &#40;or full&#41; slots where the moves would be. If you move closer or further away the sphere simply rotates horizontally &#40;for short &amp; long range moves&#41;, but should you move your monster Up or Down &#40;left &amp; right in relation to your monster&#41; the sphere rotates vertically. THIS would change the types of moves in that particuar move range. <BR> <BR>So, if you are getting my drift you would move closer or further away to change your long range/short range moves, and move side to side to change the moves within that range. The sphere really just acts as a GUI to show you your moves, and rotates in place to reflect your position and moves selectable in that move range &#40;just like the slider that moves back &amp; forth over the Move Bar in MR1 &amp; 2&#41; <BR> <BR>This would add a lot more 3D feel to the whole game instead of just moving closer or farther. Strafing side to side would now have a significant effect in battle! <BR> <BR>Fenrick
