 After being here for only 1 year I have came to know and enjoy a site known as THE Legendcup.com. It was a place for trainers to submit a monster and fight against one another. Coming here as a noob I acted retardedly and even got close to being banned, but Fenrick pointed me in the right direction so I wouldn&#39;t be banned, and he got me to enter.  <BR> <BR>I entered and got the Market Battles to start and they took off. Fights were every week and seemed to show no signs of stopping. <BR> <BR>Then MR4 came out, a hiatus was taken so that people would have time to build up their Monster Rancher 4 skills. Then entering dropped because all the serious contenders stuck with MR4 trying to figure out new aspects. Then battles became far and few with very little battles. Now, the action has stopped compared to when it was going strong back in the days of PT, MP, Torey, HR, HR83, Strunks and MANY others.  <BR> <BR>Then others came along to start their own era of competition, me, Infernus, CHB, Slappy, and a few others.  And even some &#39;old- timers&#39; came back. Ever since I was here I wanted to know the history of competition online from DP&#39;s battles to the MMBA to the LC. Now I can say I played a part in that history, along with others to compete against me and help me out.  <BR> <BR>Okay, the minor reflection is done, but now the news. The LC will be closed. The pictures and results will remain up. The battles maybe done, but we cannot forget what made the LC the LC. The dedication, the battles and the competetion. I loved to come in and listen to Strunks, Lisa and HR83 talk trash for hours. We cannot let this spirit die and end this site. I must give out ALOT of credit to Petit Trot for keeping it going. His idea is keeping the battling alive, but he can&#39;t do it alone, YOU need to pitch in.  <BR> <BR>Fenrick, thank you for holding the tournaments, the chat room and many other memories which won&#39;t die. Where ever you go I just want you to know all the respect I hold with you and all you&#39;ve done. Thank you for all the years of hard work, The LC will be missed.  <BR> <BR>-The One the Only Gogators.

 Farewell thee honorable legendcup! <BR> <BR>I will miss thee, even if I didnt participate, I read about everything while it went on before I decided to sign up for these things... <BR> <BR> <BR>I am wondering, why it shut down though?

 My time of MR is gone.  I even went out and got a TV to play the <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;</FONT> game this summer, and the TV has still yet to see use &#40;I don&#39;t even watch TV&#41;. <BR> <BR>Maybe they&#39;ll make a PC MR game someday, but I doubt it.  If they do, get in touch with me.

 I wouldn&#39;t count on me or PT dissappearing any time soon. With summer holidays coming to a near end &#40;or already ended for some&#41; we are seeing a few people more often &#40;Slappy&#41;. You&#39;re right about PT not being able to do this on his own, anyone who&#39;s able to contend, should be contending. It&#39;s fun, it pushes your skills to the limits, and ultimately, makes you a more respected, better player. <BR> <BR>LC established many people as greats, or even just as good sports &#40;which was just as good&#41;, and nothing will take that away from us/them. The LC forums may go away, and eventually the fights there may too, but with MRM, and people like PT, and newcomers such as MRfury, the fights will live on. <BR> <BR>On a side note: Bring it on GG, we need to see some more entries from you! In the immortal words of Strunks: &#34;Bring it j0oblets!&#34; <BR> <BR>I can fight anyone any time, it&#39;s YOU I want a piece of.

 Thanks guys. <BR>I am still going to be around, however LC needs a rest.  I don&#39;t know if you have noticed but the pages are slightly updated and less.... &#34;Glitchy&#34;.  I&#39;ve been converting to some better coding that makes it load quicker and more compatable with more browsers during the conversion to &#34;View Only&#34; status.   Maybe one day the LC will be Reborn like the phoenix, but at the moment time &amp; family do not permit.  After seeing several other greats sites slowly fade from existence I fear that will eventually be LC&#39;s fate as well, but it could not have been what it was without the support of it&#39;s ranchers and MRM too. <BR> <BR>Oh, BTW, the MAX DRIVE kicks arse.  10 times easier to use than the XPORT, and probably cause your PS2 a lot less harm if you had to carry it from 1 floor to another &#40;or 1 room to another&#41; in the past.

 It&#39;s so sad, to see it going, just when I found both it and this site. I wanted to enter more monsters, but with Avalon being the current winner of the tourney that was on, I couldn&#39;t enter anymore in to that one. Well I hope it does come back someday, and if it does, I&#39;ll be there with my monsters, and we&#39;ll be ready to rumble.

 I did not remove LC, simply making it &#34;Read Only&#34; and labelling it Closed for the time being.  I no longer have the time to give to the public what I used to, so instead of being unfair and making many people wait for me, I am closing the site for the time being.  Remaining open brackets will be given to Lisa to complete the unfinished tournaments and I will updte the LC accordingly. <BR> <BR>LC should now be fully remodelled, forums should be locked, and chatroom deleted.
