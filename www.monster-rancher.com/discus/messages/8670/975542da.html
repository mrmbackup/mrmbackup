 ...It&#39;s a cool method, but how is the stress level of the monster when I load, and save my game constantly?  I know if you reload the game a couple of times it wil feel rejuvenated, but I want to be sure if this method also helps reduce your monsters stress.

I thought I had a post in that thread about how it seems to work, but it got deleted when it was moved??? <FONT SIZE="+2"><FONT FACE="WINGDINGS">&#76;</FONT></FONT> <BR> <BR>The Save/Reload essentially reapplies your item bonuses each time you complete a cycle. So if you have a stress reducing item, it will work again and again. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the breakdown: <BR>1. week begins-&#62; <BR>2. Items applied-&#62; <BR>3. status message displayed <BR>4. SAVE <BR>5. LOAD <BR> <BR>The process begins again at step1 but with the stress/tiredness values from step 4. It modifies those and improves them again.

 The only time I have had stress problems with it has been when I was lazy, and only re-loaded until I saw &#34;pretty lively&#34; for the first time. Then, after doing a week of drilling, the monster usually gets a stress warning on top of the tiredness level. &#40;Ok, with a light drill it won&#39;t say the word tired if you have all the durables. I am just calling them tiredness levels because I have managed to get stress warnings on top of all of them, including &#34;really energetic&#34;.&#41; My best stretches without stress have been when I re-loaded until I saw the &#34;really energetic&#34; notice a second time. If you stick with that, everything is fine. <BR> <BR>I strongly suspect that the stress is relieved by items differently than fatigue, and there are clues to it all &#40;stress and fatigue values of drills and the effects of durables&#41; in re-loading, if anyone has time to reserahc it more. I may do a little work on it, in between doing lifespans, just to keep from going nuts!

 Stress is less noticeable mainly because there is a masking effect from fatigue. When your monster is less fatigued, it can be stressed and you&#39;ll never know.

 Ok, I have been playing around with this method for a couple of days now and I have seen something that needs to be mentioned. <BR> <BR>  I have noticed that when using this method, my monster gets FAT and GLUTTON.  I start the cycle Normal and without glutton.  By the time I get just shy of Energetic, my monster becomes FAT and acquires the Glutton trait. <BR> <BR>  The worst thing about this is that my monster ends up training poorly once I have him at energetic stage. <BR> <BR>  Can anyone else check this out and confirm what&#39;s happening?? <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 the only thing I can think of is this: <BR> <BR>Possibly if you feed them an snack, it may get applied multiple times too. <BR> <BR>I have noticed my monsters going to Indulgent and pampered at times. And it may have been on cycles where I tossed in a minst candy or something. <BR> <BR>Its hard to say, I have never had Glutton come back like that myself. Only the other form of spoiling. <BR> <BR>There is no known item that modifies food value so this is my only guess.

 It&#39;s definitely happening from the method.  Since the last snack I fed my monster is a Dietweed, I wouldn&#39;t think he would get Fat.  When the month turns and I feed him Nuts, Glutton goes away.  When I use the method to remove his fatigue, it comes back half way through the Lively section. <BR> <BR>  Of course, the worst part is that it happens when the Load part occurs, which means that I can&#39;t avoid it. <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 If you don&#39;t have the best durable items then the effect is nonexistent.  <BR>It works because it repeatedly applies the effects of these items, like Holy Cup, Bright Gem, etc. If you don&#39;t have the stuff, nothing will happen.

 each item you get will adds its effect when you use the method &#40;not multiples of the same&#41;. <BR> <BR> <BR>read about Charm if you need to buy stuff and are low on cash. &#40;characteristics section&#41;

 Another note on the Overload method: Do it too much and your data corrupts. I had almost everything, but I Overloaded too much and the file corrupted.  In other words, it wouldn&#39;t load, so I had to start all over again.

 Wow, don&#39;t let your monster get to being &#39;tired&#39; or &#39;worn out&#39; especially. I know it&#39;s hard after sparring or a venture, but make sure that you are very well before going. Once you see the tired or worn out warning, you have enough stress/fatigue to lose lifespan. With both expensive durables, it takes about three re-loads to raise one level.
