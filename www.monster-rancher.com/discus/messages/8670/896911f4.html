 The Coaching system in mra2 is different from mra1.  Coaches are only used for tougher drills, and you can hire descent coaches.  Sometimes in the even years &#40;2,22,etc.&#41;, there are super coaches that are VERY strong, and they can help your monster train.  The cool thing about some of these super coaches is that they look different from other monsters.  They are very expensice &#40;30,000K and the extra payments are a little more&#41;, but they are definitely worth the money. <BR> <BR>I just made a contract with one of the MR3 pixies, and my second Suzurin just received 26 Int. in one of the drills that focuses on Int.

 Just a few extra comments/corrections regarding the super coaches: <BR> <BR>1&#41; The highest you can gain from a coach in a hard drill is 30 for the first stat, and 22 in the second stat &#40;whether or not the drill was a &#34;success&#34;, or a &#34;great&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>2&#41; The extra payments you have to make are still the same for super coaches &#40;the payment you have to make every two years&#41;.  You have to renew your coaches&#39; &#40;right grammar?&#41; contract every two years, but the prices are the same.  So a coach Like Aegis &#40;A Monol&#41; will cost you $800 when you have to renew the contract. <BR> <BR>Anway, here are some of the better coaches I recommend when you have over $100K &#40;All are $30K each&#41;: <BR> <BR>Morgan &#40;MR3 Pixie I talked about&#41;: <BR>Pow. 500 <BR>Int. 850 <BR>Acc. 700 <BR>Spd. 600 <BR>Def. 500 <BR>Lif. 700 <BR> <BR>Char.: <BR>SwtSmell <BR>TufArmor&#40;TutArmor?&#41; <BR>Charisma <BR>Satori <BR> <BR>Arther &#40;yes, it&#39;s spelled like that&#41; <BR>Pow 800 <BR>Acc 600 <BR>Int 700 <BR>Spd 400 <BR>Def 650 <BR>Lif 700 <BR> <BR>Char: <BR>Tuf Armor <BR>UP Mind <BR>FullArmor <BR>UP Sword <BR> <BR>Aegis &#40;Pure Monol&#41; <BR>Pow 500 <BR>Acc 500 <BR>Int 500 <BR>Spd 200 <BR>Def 900 <BR>Lif 900 <BR> <BR>Char: <BR>Rocksin <BR>UPCountr <BR>UP Beams <BR> <BR>Arther and Aegis might not be supers such as Morgan &#40;I think she&#39;s a super coach sine she looks different&#41;, but their stats are worth the money.

 Yeah but regular coaches and super coaches are  <BR>two entirely different things. Supers are good to  <BR>pick up when you are focusing on beating the game  <BR>instead of raising other coaches. Also they have  <BR>nice traits in big bunches and this makes it  <BR>easier to pass them on to the trainees.

 The rank of the monster seems to have a direct effect on the max gain per drill. <BR> <BR>I made a Class B Rainbow into my INT coach. He had 999 INT, was well suited for the drill, and when training a Tiger in his adult stage, would only give 25/drill. <BR> <BR>Also coaching points are effected too. He only had 4

 Also as an update, I&#39;ve managed to pull down a 24  <BR>on the second stat in a hard drill but the  <BR>monster was in full prime and it was his nest  <BR>gainer and the coach&#39;s too. It may have only  <BR>happened on a Great, I can&#39;t remember for sure

 It also depends on the monster as to what it gains. I was raising Golizards &#40;Zuum/SP&#41; and I was using the coach Strong &#40;Gavin&#39;s monster&#41;. I was gaining 29 or 30 for the first stat everytime I trained with Strong on the harder drills &#40;not sparring&#41;.

 It seems as if coaches can unfortunately be retired after being used for a long time.  My coach Morgan &#40;the rare Pixie&#41; just called it quits after 18&#43; years of service, and she can&#39;t be used anymore.  It&#39;s one of the drawbacks for the super coaches, and I think Normal coaches can also be retired &#40;I haven&#39;t seen Gavin&#39;s monster in a while either&#41;.  If you have a super coach, use them wisely.  I am annoyed that Morgan retired b/c my Joker was close to maxxing out his Int. level.

 Yeah last night the monster Holly gave me, Gavin&#39;s golem and a tiger I raised in Skill all retired permanantly.  They can not be seen or used ever again which brings me to my only real complaint about MRA2.   <BR> <BR>Why no hall of fame.  One of the most lovely moments in MR2 was when you beat the great four and final one on one tournament against one of the white monsters &#40;either a white suezo or white mocchi&#41; and your monster was placed in a hall of fame listed under the town locations.  It gave your monsters names, age of completing each grade, forte&#39; &#40;an attack your monster has, which people have various theories about&#41;, and a picrure of youre monster striking a historic pose.  This hall meant that up to three monsters could be remembered forever when they one the game.  Once you had three you were given the option to replace any of them with any winning monster.  Just something I miss.

 Super Coaches will reappear once they leave you.  You just have to pay the deposit again when you see them available.  I just rebought Morgan, and this time I&#39;ll try to make a coach similar to her when she has to leave again.

 it really stinks that you can never get coaches that you trained back &#40;or can you?&#41;. my reason for this is i made like 2 or 3 of my very best and hardest trained monsters and made them coaches...&#40;sigh...&#41;... <BR> <BR>Psyphon

 Well, that&#39;s why you wait until they&#39;re done  <BR>battle wise before making them coaches. Also in  <BR>the 16 years that they are a coach, you can raise  <BR>several monsters to that level and beyond. <BR> <BR>Also, this is a good chance for me to eat some  <BR>crow. It was posted that there is a way to keep a  <BR>coach forever by missing the warnings. This was  <BR>tested and proven inaccurate but it is possible  <BR>for a coach to stay forever. I have had it happen  <BR>to me now. I owe an apology to the original  <BR>poster for doubting him. <BR> <BR>You get all normal retirement warnings but still  <BR>somehow the coach is there. You can no longer  <BR>reassign the coach, but he will continue to train  <BR>in all drills he was in before. <BR> <BR>My new theory about why is this: Charisma. I  <BR>think this is the knack for teaching. They stay  <BR>and teach forever. I think when I had Morgan she  <BR>may have been ready to stay, but I slotted in a  <BR>new coach immediately.

 Im not sure this has anything to do with how coaches can stay forever BUT I thought I might as well post what happened to me. <BR> <BR>When I read this thread about coaches staying for ever I tried to get my dragon/antlan coach &#40;raised myself&#41; to stay by taking him off of all drills untill after I recieved the retirement message and then put him on the next month. That didnt work and my coach left forever :&#40;  <BR> <BR>Then it was time for my other self-trained dragon coach &#40;a diabros&#41; to retire, I trained with him in the month I got the warning and after, without taking him off of his coaching. He ended up staying with three of his duties out of 5. so thats not bad! :&#41;  <BR> <BR>Dont know if that helps any, but its what happened to me. I think I&#39;ll try testing it when my other self-trained coaches are going to retire.

 I had a similar happening to Diamond. My self-trained dragon coach was retiring that month. I used him to train in Pow/Ski, and he got locked into that position &#40;and only that position, unfortunately&#41;. He does have Charisma, FYI, Goldenboy. It does seem, also, that training with the monster before they leave does have something to do with it.

 It&#39;s not a deciding factor though. I just lost my Power coach and I had trained with him in the last month.

 Agreed. Aegis did training up until the day he left &#40;and my poor monster was exhausted!&#41;, and he didn&#39;t stay around to help any more. I&#39;ll see if my JeetKoonDo &#40;who also has Charisma&#41; might hang around after doing some training. He&#39;s the next one to leave, though he&#39;s still got quite a few years left on him.

 I agree with Zaketa, it is much cheaper to just max out a monster in a certain stat &#40;or stats :p..&#41; and use it as a coach, I gain 30 int every time my 999 int pixi coaches an int drill &#40;with a Suezo&#41; 30 power every time my 999 power Golem coaches a Strength drill &#40;with my Naga and Arrow Head&#41;, etc.,
