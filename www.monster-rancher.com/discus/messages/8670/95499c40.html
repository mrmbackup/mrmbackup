 Everyone has had a baby that is difficult in the  <BR>early part of his life. Well one way to avoid  <BR>trouble and get to bigger statgains sooner is to  <BR>raise Reliance&#40;Loyalty&#41; With 2nd gen monsters  <BR>this isn&#39;t hard they can be born with up to 40  <BR>Reliance already. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;ve found one good way to get a baby going  <BR>on the right track is lots of gifts. <BR>There are two categories of items, Snacks and  <BR>Presents. Snacks are limited to one a week as the  <BR>monster gets &#34;full&#34; but you can give several  <BR>presents in the same week. <BR> <BR>So when you bring a baby home, try this: find a  <BR>gift item that Holly says he likes &#40;monster toys  <BR>or flowers are availabe in the shop, I haven&#39;t  <BR>checked the others yet to see what categories  <BR>they are&#41; I tested a baby Manirin and got his  <BR>reliance up to 7 in week 1 with 2 Flowers and a  <BR>MonToy. His raising style was still at normal  <BR>too, I will be checking to see how much it takes  <BR>to head toward spoiled. <BR> <BR>More research is to follow, I just wanted to give  <BR>you guys a heads up.

 Here&#39;s my &#34;Baby Monster Blues&#34;, the GLUTTON char! So far, ALL the monsters I&#39;ve raised o far eventually get this char. Can anyone tell me how to avoid this? I usually feed my monster a &#34;balanced&#34; diet of meat, fish and fruits &#40;orange or banana&#41;. Also, what exactly does Glutton do to your monster? <BR> <BR>In line with this, does milk still work? I mean, it&#39;s really just a force of habit that I carry with me from the older games. But is it still adviseable to feed your monster milk for the first few months of its life even if it doesn&#39;t make it happy? Just curious :P

 Most baby monsters get Glutton and then will lose  <BR>it when they reach adulthood. Its one of the ways  <BR>the game governs you from working the baby  <BR>monster too hard. Don&#39;t worry about it too much.   <BR> <BR>I get rid of it whenever I get the adult warning,  <BR>by feeding vitamins for a month or two. I may use  <BR>diet weed if the monster has gone to fat instead  <BR>of just obese. Surgery is pointless &#40;ask Lisa&#41;  <BR>the trait will more than likely come back the  <BR>next week.

 This has been pretty constant through all MR  <BR>games, the more strict you are the bigger  <BR>statgains you get, but the shorter the monster&#39;s  <BR>life due to stress. There are some stages where  <BR>being a little strict is actually good. I try to  <BR>be strict early on then ease off as the monster  <BR>gets older.

 Check your monster&#39;s stat every week. When it becomes &#34;spoilt&#34;, just give it something it doesn&#39;t like. Most monsters don&#39;t like wine and charred newt. Alternatively, if you don&#39;t want to spend money &#40;cheapskate!&#41;, just enter a battle, win it, and don&#39;t praise your monster. These two methods are guaranteed to bring back the status to &#34;pampered&#34;.

 You think thats bad? I am obviously not the best at this game, but I completely mucked up when I removed Glutton 5 times in a row from my monster then just gave up...I can&#39;t believe I did that now...I feel stupid...but, from what I can see, it does nothing, you can still only give it one food item a week and it gets the same nutrients from each item, so I have no idea about it...oh well.

 all glutton is for is to moderate how much work  <BR>you can do to a young or spoiled monster. it  <BR>seems to increase the amount of tiredness a  <BR>monster gets when doing a drill. The only upside  <BR>to it is it may also buffer stress. I have a hard  <BR>time stressing out baby monsters, although that  <BR>might be because of items.

 It may actually increase lifespan, but like Holly  <BR>says, the monster won&#39;t take his training  <BR>seriously. Which means lower gains, more  <BR>failures, and willful behavior.

 not bragging but all my monsters end up spoiled and they still act good as long as you do scold them when they fail.  And ALL baby monsters get glutton, even if you don&#39;t feed them the first month so just give them their favorite food for the reliance boost instead of making them mad.

 Interesting phenomena with my current baby. He&#39;s kind of acting like he has Glutton, even though he already has 6 traits. He&#39;s obese, and he gets tired more quickly. Something tells me that some of the effects we were linking with Glutton aren&#39;t all its fault. <BR> <BR>Unless there is a mystical 7th slot, with an invisible Glutton.

 Strange.  I was wondering if you could train a baby better if it already had six traits.  Is it turning out a little better? <BR> <BR>I believe you can shed Glutton &#40;and keep it off&#41; before Holly&#39;s Adult Warning &#40;although you can gain glutton at anypoint in a moster&#39;s life also&#41;.  I was doing some lifespan research with a golem like Lisa Shock did and found that I could switch from Vitamins to Bananas without regaining glutton a good ways before the adult warning. <BR> <BR>Unfortuanatly changing variables like that ruined the lifespan aspect of the test.

 So far its impossible to tell if its better or worse. It seems better, just like it did the first time I had a 6trait baby, but I will have to play out his life to know for sure. <BR> <BR>My theory is, best lifespans come from being able to keep Glutton until its almost ready to go on its own. My two best lived monsters both had glutton until right around the adult warning &#40;a little longer&#41; and it seemed to help. Again its speculation, I have nothing to back it up, ymmv.

 Whenever I get a new monster, I either get Glutton or not depending on what&#39;s the first food I feed them... <BR> <BR>If I give them food that makes it so that their figure is Obese, or Fat, like Meat or Fish, I get Glutton. <BR> <BR>If I give them food that makes it so that their figure is Thin, or Normal, like Vitamins or Nuts, I either don&#39;t get glutton or lose glutton. <BR> <BR>From my experiences I would think that Glutton is actually a predictable trait, maybe in a ways like Popular.

 Glutton just kind of happens to some monsters, popular is in no way predictable except that winning matches and raising certain monsters like mocchi increases your chances of getting it, it too just kind of happens.

 Balance out the lifespan lost by forcibly removing Glutton &#40;I truly believe it is bad for a monster to do it&#41; with the extra drills gained early on when they don&#39;t gain very well anyway. I doubt it pays off other than you have quick and dirty monsters. This may be fine if you don&#39;t need a full life span, but otherwise...

 Whoah, I&#39;m wasn&#39;t recommending anything.  It hasn&#39;t been proven yet but I tend to agree with GoldenBoy about the &#34;glutton buffer&#34;.  I&#39;d like to tackle more lifespan research but my game is still new enough that there are lots of other things that need tackling. <BR>In anycase raising those dang newbie monsters is a pain as I almost always need to get rid of Glutton around the same time I&#39;m trying adjust form, style, reliance, and everything else that hasn&#39;t stablized yet.  Maybe they made the game that way on purpose :&#41; <BR>&#34;Look he&#39;s having trouble lets end the baby blues and through adolescents at him.&#34;

 I&#39;ve found that trying to force glutton off my monsters too quickly with lots of oranges and vitamins and dietweed can be fast, but it also tends to leave my monsters with anemia. The worst thing about anemia for me is that it can linger for quite some time before I notice... usually during a fight, when their stats go down. I say, endure the glutton.

 from my experiance glutton is controllable. <BR>truths as far as me &#40;i dont no about u, though&#41;: <BR>1&#41;Removing glutton with surgery while monster is fat or obese is useless. <BR>2&#41;The more a monster likes a food, the more they&#39;ll eat it, thus increasing possibility of weight gain. <BR>3&#41; foods that are more filling, like meat and fish, contribute more to weight gain, while emptier foods, like vitamins and desert, contirbute less, and can possible slim the monster. <BR>4&#41; &#34;Nothing&#34; is a good way to slim your monster fast if you dont mind the stress and losing 2-3 points of reliance. <BR>5&#41; i&#39;v had times when the monster was fat, but no glutton since i fed it nothing that month, gave it one dietweed, and POW! it had glutton. <BR>6&#41; after the first time, which i have a pain trying to avoid, glutton is easily prevented by feeding foods moderatly liked and moderatly filling or, if this isn&#39;t possible, like with my Chaos head that likes fish and meat and hates everything else, switching between the semi extremes, i.e. meat, 3 points satisfied, not happy/worry holly, one month, then potatoes, 1 point filled but not harsh, the next or meat, 1 point, then dessert, 4 points. these are not exact plans but just the general concept of my monster normal diet.after that first 3 month or so period of obesity, &#40;yes i get rid of it that soon, i hate glutton!&#41; my monster stays normal with my diet, except towards the end when they get all anorexic and turn thin, but i&#39;m afraid to spoil them. <BR>7&#41; When fed cheese, some monsters get fat exactly the way a rock wouldn&#39;t.

 Training and Resting increase a monsters weight, obviously &#34;food&#34; does the same. <BR> <BR>Sparring and Battles decrease weight. You&#39;ll find that by the time your monster reaches &#34;adulthood&#34; you&#39;ll be entering more tournaments. <BR> <BR>In essence, the more you battle the more weight your monster loses. So what seems like the Glutton trait not appearing is actually you battling more. <BR> <BR>The worst affect of Glutton is it maintains the Obese figure. This greatly affects training because you will need more rest or stress/fatigue supplements so you can do more training. And as resting and training only increase your weight you&#39;re back to where you started. :p <BR> <BR>My unfounded theory for getting Glutton is because your monster is at the farm training and resting, most likely why it &#34;finds&#34; items, its got a food stash somehere we don&#39;t know about.... <BR> <BR>LoL
