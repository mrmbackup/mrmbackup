 I use a Wolfkin &#91;Garu/Tiger&#93; <BR>It was 2nd gen, but only combined from two monsters straight from the shrine, only item used in combining was a pow stone! <BR>It got to rank s easily! I combined it with a Grendel &#40;and got another Wolfkin&#41; and used a lif stone, this one should do very well. <BR>It started with high pow and other stats! I think it will be good. That&#39;s a great combo, you should try it. &#40;if you want to&#41;

 That is interesting, since according to the chart  <BR>a Sprite &#40;Wolfkin&#41; and a Fanciful &#40;Naga&#41;  <BR>shouldn&#39;t make a very good combo. <BR> <BR>Would you list the starting stats of your 2nd  <BR>generation Wolfkin, as well as recreate the  <BR>Wolfikin you had originally so we can see their  <BR>starting stats side by side?

 Oh, I&#39;ve already raised that Wolfkin... &#40;the &#91;Wolfkin/Grendel&#93; one, so the starting stats are gone&#41; <BR>But I definitely can recreate the starting stats of my original Wolfkin for you! <BR>Here: <BR>Pow: 150 <BR>Int: 80 <BR>Acc: 120 <BR>Spd: 110 <BR>Def: 110 <BR>Lif: 90 <BR>This is without the effects of the pow stone, as I don&#39;t have it anymore. If you know what it does, and add it&#39;s effect, those were my original Wolfkin&#39;s stats. <BR>You probably don&#39;t need this extra information, but I want to explain it to you, so: <BR>This is the way I trained it. <BR>I&#39;d use two light drills, then a hard drill.  <BR>I used the Mocchi coach you started with, Masimaro &#40;sp?&#41; and the Golem coach you get, Strong. <BR>I used SmashUp with the mocchi <BR>and Tow with the Golem. <BR>The pattern looked like this: <BR>Shove <BR>Shoot <BR>SmashUp <BR>Tackle <BR>Rock <BR>Tow <BR>Sidestep <BR>Shove <BR>SmashUp <BR>and it continued. <BR>I did not raise int at all. <BR>It ended up with about lvl 12 pow, and all other stats at lvl 6-8. &#40;except lif was 9&#41; <BR>After it could no longer battle, I stopped, frozse it, and raised a Grendel. Knowing nothing about what made a good combo, I just raised Grendel because it was good at pow. &#40;the strategy was to raise pow so high that the other stats didn&#39;t have to be very good. It works VERY well for me, because I would just KO my opponents quickly.&#41; <BR>I combined the two monsters. The Grendel had lvl 15 pow &#40;trained the same way as the Wolfkin&#41; <BR>and about the same lvls as the Wolfkin for the other stats. <BR>The combination produced my current Wolfkin, who has just reached the end of its battling life. <BR>It&#39;s stats as they are now are: <BR>Pow: 708 <BR>Int: 85 <BR>Acc: 339 <BR>Spd: 355 <BR>Def: 366 <BR>Lif: 424 <BR>It is at S rank and has these traits: <BR>Up Fangs <BR>Up Claws <BR>Up Earth &#40;from the Golem coach&#39;s training&#41; <BR>Up Mind &#40;from the mocchi coach&#39;s training&#41; <BR>Popular <BR>Hi Aim &#40;from the Agima coach&#41; <BR>It&#39;s record is 31W 0L <BR>100 fame <BR>38800 winnings. <BR>It is Slim, but I&#39;ll fix that. <BR>This Wolfkin has unlocked Dragon for me, and has been the best monster I&#39;ve ever raised, in any MR game. <BR>Thanks for the interest.

 Sounds like you&#39;re doing a solid job, that&#39;s a decent early monster. I&#39;d recommend making him into a coach when he retires. <BR> <BR>However you&#39;re right training and final stats aren&#39;t really thtopic for this thread. What I hope to hammer out are the sorts of mixes that make great baby monsters. Since we don&#39;t have someone like Dadge to evaluate the combos, and we as a breeder have to choose the outcome, then we need to come up with some research to guide people in picking breeds and making the best babies from compatible parents.

 I toyed around with the Studio by trying some combos with my pure 3rd gen. Joker.  To see what kind of Joker I would get from the combos, I decided to mix up it with a Pure Garu that had 999 Pow and Speed, my current Mocchi/Gali with 999 Spd, Int, Acc, and Lif, and a Fresh Phoenix I made weeks ago.  Here are the results of my combos when I wanted to make a new Joker from them, and some more info on each monster&#42;: <BR> <BR>Stat. Legend: Pow/Int/Acc/Spd/Def/Lif <BR>&#40;#&#41; -&#62; Gen <BR> <BR>Experiment 1 <BR>&#40;3&#41; Joker/Joker 522/999/999/999/317/735 <BR>&#40;2&#41; Phoenix/Phoenix&#42;&#42; -&#62; 195/246/181/207/142/155 <BR>Results&#42;&#42;&#42; 150/203/180/155/107/125 <BR> <BR>Experiment 2 <BR>&#40;3&#41; Joker/Joker -&#62; 522/999/999/999/317/735 <BR>&#40;1&#41; Mocchi/Gali -&#62; 554/999/999/999/292/999 <BR>Results -&#62; 162/220/145/168/116/136 <BR> <BR>Experiment 3 <BR>&#40;3&#41; Joker/Joker -&#62; 522/999/999/999/317/735 <BR>&#40;1&#41; Garu/Garu -&#62; 175/237/210/181/125/146 <BR>Results -&#62; 175/237/210/181/125/146 <BR> <BR>&#42;All combos were done without any Items such as the DefStone. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;In case anyone thought I used a&#91;n illegal&#93;SP Phoenix <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;Remember, I&#39;m only mixing for Jokers.  No other monster. <BR> <BR>I had a thesis/theory that subs somewhat determine the results of your combos, and there&#39;s more to combining rather than just mixing up any beasts/sprites/fancifuls/artificials with any Spirits.  In other words, any Durahan, or artifical can be mixed with any Joker, but that doesn&#39;t mean it can make a great monster. <BR> <BR>  The first experiment didn&#39;t surprise me that much b/c Joker and Phoenix are spirits.  They are not supposed to get along, but maybe the Phoenix could have been an exception if I bothered to raise it at all &#40;Keep in mind that my Phoenix is VERY fresh, and it hasn&#39;t been trained yet&#41;.  Experiments 2 &#43; 3, however, did surprise me b/c of the results even if my Phoenix was a second gen monster. <BR> <BR>  I thought I would get more from the Mocchi/Gali due to the stats that it had, but the Garu/Garu results beat it by a couple of points.  My Garu&#39;s stats had nothing similar to my Joker&#39;s stats, but it surprisingly worked out.  I think the Mocchi/Gali combo did not work b/c of the Gali sub my Mocchi has.  Since Gali&#39;s a Spirit, and Joker&#39;s a Spirit, it did not work properly &#40;Remember, spirits cannot get along with each other...for now&#41;.  However, since my Garu had Garu as a sub, it made a much better Joker since Spirits can be mixed with non-spirits. <BR> <BR>Another neat thing I noticed is that depending on the monster you pick as the first one, it seems to determine the personality trait &#40;e.g. Kind, Coward, etc.&#41;.  My Joker had the Kind personality, and when I made a new Joker from each combo, I managed to keep the trait.  The cool thing about is that You can switch the personality to the offspring that is different from the monsters you are mixing up. <BR> <BR>e.g. I want to mix Devil Man the Joker with Satan the Archreaper.  Devil Man&#39;s kind, but Satan&#39;s Brave.  If Devil Man&#39;s the first monster I picked for the combo, and then I choose Satan, I can make my future Joker/Archreaper a kind monster since Devil Man was the first one to be combined.  If want my next Joker to be brave, I would make Satan the first Joker to be mixed instead of Devil Man.  It doesn&#39;t matter which result you picked.  It will always take the personality from the first monster you selected for the combo. <BR> <BR>Sorry for the length, and if everyone else knew about this, but I thought I could share my experiences with mra2&#39;s combining system.  If it&#39;s old info, feel free to delete it.

 I need to make a correction.  The stats my Garu had were the following: <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41; Garu/Garu 999/165/699/999/169/585 <BR> <BR>Sorry about that.

 I experimented with the personality traits you get, and results are kinda interesting.  I think generation, and possibly what type of monsters you are choosing for the combo somewhat play an important role in the personality.  This is what I came up with when I mixed my 4.3 yr. Joker with my 4.0 yr. Garu, a fresh Phoenix, and a fresh Anathema &#40;Joker/SP&#41;&#42;: <BR> <BR>Legend: &#40;#&#41; -&#62; Generation of Monster <BR> <BR>Experiment 1 <BR>&#40;3&#41;Joker/Joker -&#62; Kind <BR>&#40;1&#41;Joker/SP&#42;&#42; -&#62; Calm <BR>Joker Results -&#62; Kind <BR>Anathema Results -&#62; Kind <BR> <BR>Experiment 2 <BR>&#40;1&#41;Joker/SP -&#62; Calm <BR>&#40;3&#41;Joker/Joker - Kind <BR>Anathema Results -&#62; Calm <BR>Joker Results -&#62; Calm <BR> <BR>Experiment 3 <BR>&#40;3&#41;Joker/Joker -&#62; Kind <BR>&#40;1&#41;Phoenix/Phoenix&#42;&#42;&#42; -&#62; Normal <BR>Joker Result -&#62; Kind <BR>Phoenix Result -&#62; <BR> <BR>Experiment 4 <BR>&#40;1&#41;Phoenix/Phoenix -&#62; Normal <BR>&#40;3&#41;Joker/Joker -&#62; Kind <BR>Phoenix Results -&#62; Normal <BR>Joker Results -&#62; Normal <BR> <BR>Experiment 5 <BR>&#40;3&#41;Joker/Joker -&#62; Kind <BR>&#40;1&#41;Garu/Garu -&#62; Normal <BR>Joker Results -&#62; Kind <BR>Garu Results -&#62; Kind <BR>Garu/Joker Results -&#62; Kind <BR> <BR>Experiment 6 <BR>&#40;1&#41;Garu/Garu -&#62; Normal <BR>&#40;3&#41;Joker/Joker -&#62; Kind <BR>Garu Results -&#62; Kind <BR>Joker Results -&#62; Kind <BR>Garu/Joker Results -&#62; Kind <BR> <BR>&#42;No items were invovled when I made these combos. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;I am using a fresh Anathema for this experiment. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;Still using the Phoenix from my stat experiment. <BR> <BR>I think if the monsters are in the same groups, the personality of the monster you created with the combo is determined by the first monster in the combo &#40;e.g. you pick a Cowardly Dragon and then a Brave Gali for the combo&#41;.  However, I think there might be more to the personality when mixing different groups together.  I personally think it has something to do with the generation since my Joker was a 3rd gen monster and my Garu was a 1st gen, but I can be wrong. <BR> <BR>Even though everyone probably knows about this, another neat thing I noticed with combos is that the stats can very depending on the order of your combo.  I mean, if you decide to mix a Garu with a Joker, you might get some different stats depending on whether or not you picked your Garu as the first monster to be combined.  This is what I came up with after I raised my Garu for a few more months, and toyed around with the combo order &#40;once again, no items were used&#41;: <BR> <BR>Stat Legend -&#62; Pow/Int/Acc/Spd/Def/Lif <BR>&#40;#&#41; -&#62; Generation of Monster. <BR> <BR>Experiment 7 <BR>&#40;1&#41;Garu/Garu -&#62; 999/228/999/999/285/757 <BR>&#40;3&#41;Joker/Joker -&#62; 522/999/999/999/336/745 <BR>Garu Results -&#62; 190/90/130/155/155/116 <BR>Joker Results -&#62; 162/220/195/168/116/136 <BR>Garu/Joker Results -&#62; 181/116/168/130/175/142 <BR> <BR>Experiment 8 <BR>&#40;3&#41;Joker/Joker -&#62; 522/999/999/999/336/745 <BR>&#40;1&#41;Garu/Garu -&#62; 999/228/999/999/285/757 <BR>Joker Results -&#62; 175/237/210/181/125/146 <BR>Garu Results -&#62; 210/97/140/167/167/125 <BR>Garu/Joker Results -&#62; 195/125/181/140/188/153 <BR> <BR>Note: I somewhat toyed with my Jokers stats to gain all of its attacks.  That&#39;s why I have a few more life and defense points for my Joker/Joker. <BR> <BR>This might be old news, but my point with the last two experiments is that the order of the results can really determine good or bad stats  for certain monsters &#40;e.g. the Mew/Gali you would get for mixing a Mew with a Gali&#41;.  So you gotta be careful with what monster you are going to mix up especially if the have a third result. <BR> <BR>I hope this post will help some people, but I apologize if it didn&#39;t.  It was last minute research mostly based on the personalities.

 Compatibility is like what Dadge used to do for us in MR2. People interested in combining for ideal stats and traits will need a way to judge which breeds go together.

 also, if beats and artificials aren&#39;t compatable, why did my abyssinian and the wild zuum headroom become best friends and spark &#40;my abyssinian&#41; learn the soulmate tech headroom block?

 Compatability has nothing to do with Soulmates... I think.

 You are correct. It deals with combining, as GB said.

 I thought I&#39;d put in this question about a very important typo-- you said that &#34;Sprits&#34; are not compatible with others of their group.  Did you mean &#34;Spirits&#34; or &#34;Sprites&#34;?  The distinction will make a lot of difference in my long-term raising plan.
