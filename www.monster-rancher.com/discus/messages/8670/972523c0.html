 Just got through raising a 1st gen Joker... Here are his stats: <BR> <BR>POW: 999 <BR>INT: 999 <BR>ACC: 999 <BR>SPD: 999 <BR>DEF: 999 <BR>LIF: 999 <BR>Reliance: 100 <BR>Normal Body Type and Raising Method. <BR>81 Wins, 0 Losses. <BR>244400 in Winnings. <BR>Fame 100. <BR>All Techs. <BR>Traits: Up Mind <BR>Charisma <BR>UpCountr <BR> <BR>S&#39;Truth. I used the Save/Load method that I posted previously, and the best coaches in the game.

Not trying to harsh your mellow, but lets turn this into some real research instead of a brag post ok? <BR> <BR>By best coaches do you mean AGIMA supercoaches or your own? <BR>How old is your Joker? <BR>Has he gotten his warning yet? <BR>Does he have any useful lifespan left after maxing out? <BR>By 1st gen do you mean straight from a password at the shrine? <BR>If so, what were the pass and starting stats? <BR>If not then you should know that Joker made with a mask and two trained monsters doesn&#39;t qualify as 1st gen. <BR> <BR>He has 81 wins, but where &#40;rank&#41; were most of your fights? The statgains from battle are just as important as training, so clue us in on whether you rushed up to A and S and gained more there, or fought in the lower ranks. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not the fact that you maxed him, its HOW you maxed him.

 My apologies. Was just too eager to post, I suppose. Yes, a majority of his fights were in S class. I didn&#39;t even raise him to d, until he was nearly a year old. He is currently 3 yrs, 11 months, and has not received the retirement warning. And yes, by 1st gen, I do mean straight from the shrine, to raising. No pass, so, suppose that means not 1st gen, but I am confident that it can work with any monster with consistent enough training methods. Additionally, it seems that the net stat gain from even S class battles does not equal what the coaches can produce. And by best coaches, meaning Morgan, Aegis, and a Lesi that seems comparable to Arther. Starting stats as follows: <BR> <BR>POW: 125 <BR>INT: 170 <BR>ACC: 150 <BR>SPD: 130 <BR>DEF: 90 <BR>LIF: 105 <BR> <BR>It seems that he is just on the dowside of his lifespan, irregardless of not receiving the warning yet, as stat gains tapered off around the 950&#39;s.

 Excellent thanks for the post. <BR> <BR>The gains tapered because you exceeded your coaches. When you have some coaches with 999 in the relevant stats, and are suited for their drills, then you get max gain all the way up to to top. <BR> <BR>Regarding tourney statgain, I asked merely so i could judge what those gains were. I know they don&#39;t exceed drill gains until the very end of life, but you have to admit, 20 and 9 from class S  is a lot different than say 9 and 4 in D. <BR> <BR>Since he is shrined, he counts as first gen, since the book values revert to default stats &#43; whatever traits you combined for. <BR> <BR>I have a Campanella I was planning on maxing, since he was born with Elite and I grafted on Ironhart. When I get around to doing it, I will compare my results to yours. I don&#39;t know if I have the patience to Overload &#40;the term I use for your trick&#41; instead of rest, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll use it sometimes. <BR> <BR>Good Job Nyght.

 Yeah, he&#39;s right, I maxed my Diva at 3 years, 10 months last night.. just proves how badly the reload thing imbalances this.
