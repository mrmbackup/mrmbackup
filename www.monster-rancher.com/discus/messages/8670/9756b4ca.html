 I had already started this with my Hare and then halfway through 100 &#40;the # of times I&#39;m trying with each breed&#41; with my frozen Angel before I realized it&#39;d be better if the monster started w/o traits.   Seeing as how my c-ranked Hare &amp; master-ranked Angel didn&#39;t have any rank related differences in the traits given or any generation related differences &#40;a Gali I also tried a bit was 2nd gen&#41;, a fresh-from-pass, no-trait, e-rank monster would work perfectly.  Unfortunately, I only have such a pass for the suzurin-breed.  So, what I&#39;m gonna have to do now is try hundreds of letter/etc combinations to find these rare, non-trait monsters. Soooo...  if anyone has any monster-passes of any other breeds, the help would be kind. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post the Kuririn&#39;s list once I do it.  Oh, and I&#39;ll check any Mews I come across for int-moves. <BR> <BR>Also, an extra bit of info concerning the good doctor.  It seems that for a short while after surgery, stat increases during drills, drop 5-10 points.  The happened on my Hare&#39;s hard power drills, and it had hi-power from an earlier surgery.  It does return to normal tho.  Suppose it&#39;s part of the price.

 This is a good area to research, it needs doing. I&#39;ll contrribute what I find as I proceed as well. That said, I have  couple points to make: <BR> <BR>1&#41; In my opinion a traitless monster won&#39;t make much difference. If you are just working on a list of what the good doctor can give to a breed, then having one slot free or 6 slots free shouldn&#39;t matter. Don&#39;t make your work harder that way. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Using a traitless monster may scew your results. Each breed  has certain common traits, and using a breed that doesnt have any of them may increase the chaces that the doctor give them to you. Thus, you may see Up Fire 20 times if you use a dragon without it, and you could miss that chance to see Up Claw&#43; or something rarer. <BR> <BR>3&#41; There is a strong possibility that the list of traits from the Doc grows and changes as the monster gets older. Some Up&#43; traits or other thing may only appear after a given rank, or really rare traits like dignity may become available later. <BR> <BR>4&#41; try to plan out a solid method and as I said, I&#39;ll contribute anything I run into.

 Actually, my hare was 1 yr, 11 mths and got up hand&#43; 6 times out of 100, while my too old Angel didn&#39;t get a single plus in the 52 I did &#40;oddly, she didn&#39;t get up hands or claws either while she did get feet, breath, beams, and dance&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The reason I want to use traitless monsters is that once a monster has a trait, it&#39;ll never come up.   Angels start with SureHeal, but my Hare could get through the doc.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s probably generic like ironhart, eagleeye, and the hi&#39;s. <BR> <BR>If a monster starts with a trait its species can get from the doc, it screws up the data.  My Angel had up magic, but prehaps it could of got it from the doc.

 Of course I may load up monsters with the generic uniques &#91;ironhart, etc&#93; and others with the basic ups they get for their breed to see what comes up.

 my point is this, if its common for the breed to get it then it does no good to take it away from a base monster, since you&#39;ll be decreasing your chances of seeing any rarer trait. <BR> <BR>It pretty much a given that if the breed commonly displays a trait then the doc will give it. Also, if its a common trait for that breed, then I&#39;m simply gonna look for a password that has it, and not waste 20,000G to get it from the Doc. <BR> <BR>I think we can all agree that mainly we want to know the rare and interesting traits available more than we want to know about the common ones. <BR> <BR>Please don&#39;t say your trying to analyze how often the traits appear, since 100 trials isn&#39;t even close to an adequate statistical analyisis. <BR> <BR>Please remember this, I am not trying to shoot down your idea, I really want you to do this research, but I think it would be best for the MRA2 players to focus on the useful information. I really want to know what Up&#43; each breed can get, or that Dignity may appear one time in a 1000.

 I understand what you mean, and I figured 100 probably wasn&#39;t enough.  It&#39;s just that moves that a breed may have common, certain monsters may not be able to get it via pass.  Prehaps the doc can give a hare foresee, or a pixie swtsmell.  Some rares don&#39;t start with these, and it&#39;d be useful knowledge to some people.  <BR> <BR>Probably the best way to research this would be to go to the doc at least 500 times with a no-trait monster, a monster with 5 hi-traits, a monster with 5 up-traits, and a monster with most of the doctor-obtainable common unique traits.  Age and rank don&#39;t seem to effect results, but I do wonder if up hands&#43; showed up because of traits my hare already had. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll go ahead and post my hare&#39;s results incase it proves useful.

 Hare &#91;pass=dirt&#93; {Usagi}: C-rank, 1 yr. 11 mths. <BR>Starting traits: Foresee, UpLtning <BR>Coach-gained traits: Up Mind, Up Feet <BR>Doc-gained &#40;from my first visit&#41;: Hi-Power <BR> <BR>Traits out of 100 tries: <BR> <BR>Hi Power - 1 &#40;from earlier&#41; <BR>Hi Stamina - 6 <BR>Hi Aim - 8 <BR>Hi IQ - 6 <BR>Hi Speed - 11 <BR>Up Hands - 9 <BR>Up Hands&#43; - 6 <BR>Up Fists - 9 <BR>Up Head - 11 <BR>Up Dance - 6 <BR>IronHart - 9 <BR>EagleEye - 10 <BR>Sure Heal - 8 <BR> <BR>My guess is that it could probably gotten up feet as well, but the results were tainted.

 All the Hi traits help in getting Elite <BR> <BR>I&#39;m fairly sure the Doc only has one Up&#43; per breed in his lists. <BR> <BR>Alright one final argument. Think of it this way, if a player is diligent enough to visit the Doctor repeatedly, do you really think they are going to go seeking a fairly useless trait like SwtSmell or Foresee? No. This is for people trying to make optimal monsters, and they want to know what Up&#43;&#39;s might be available, or that the Ironhart they got can&#39;t be improved upon.

 &#39;K, I give.  ^_^ <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;ll go 200-times per breed with a monster that has the most common trait for their breed &#40;pixie=swtsmell, tiger=upltning, golem=rockskin, etc&#41;. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re no doubt right on how people wouldn&#39;t go to the doc for such traits.  Besides, since the traits are so common, they can just combine if they want them. <BR> <BR>Later, I&#39;ll try monsters with lots of moves when I get lots of money.  Well, unless someone has a shark to save me trouble.  Oh, and I don&#39;t have the time to do more than 200-tries.  It takes forever with that unskipable waiting room...  wait.

 Just out of curiousity. Didn&#39;t you got full armor? Because it seems strange to me. I got full armor randomly almost after 5-7 times trials. And after 200 years ranching, I never met Dr. Kohak in 1st week anymore. Often I met him in 2nd week. Is this related ?

 Fullarmr doesnt sound like a trait a Suzurin can earn. The list varies based on breed. <BR> <BR>Whether you get Dr. Kohak is random. There is a post in the Characteristics section that describes how to get the doc.

 Has anyone figured out if you can get glasshrt on a gali? Can a monster have glasshrt and ironhart? Do you have to win the dignity cup to get dignity? Is dignity a key to getting statking? Has anyone else noticed that if you hit R and L in the battle selection menu you scroll through the months? Does my breath smell? What color underwear am I wearing? Am I wearing any? I hope so.

 A monster can have both Glasshrt and Ironhart. I don&#39;t really know how a monster gets dignity. I don&#39;t know how to get statking. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s supposed to scroll through the months. that way you can look ahead and plan accordingly.
