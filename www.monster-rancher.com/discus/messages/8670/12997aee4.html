 Well, I&#39;ve been experimenting with Dragons. I&#39;m a HUGE Dragon Breed fan, so I&#39;ve raised about up to... 4-5 Dragons, maybe? So far, I have Ragnaroks &#40;combined Monol and Dragon,l but cannot use him yet, since I froze him, Diaboros, which is my MASTER ranked Dragon, whose 4 of his skills are over 700 now. Sovereign, which is my XtalDragon. And Slythe, which is the name of my Diva Dragon. <BR> <BR>Erm, now I&#39;ll skip all the boring junk. <BR> <BR>I was carefully looking into some of the topics on MR2. I believe GoldenBoy or someone else stated that a monster with over 500 LIF, and has about 999INT would become a &#34;suitable&#34; monster for Expeditions, yes? <BR> <BR>So, I raised my Dragon STRAIGHT TO Rank A. When it was a baby Dragon, I always made it it Hard Drills repeatedly. &#40;I&#39;m going to go straight tio the point&#41; <BR> <BR>After 3 yrs of doing NOTHING but Hard Drills that boosted up Int and Lif, and battling in Official Ranked Tournaments, E, D, C, and B. I finally got it to A Rank. <BR> <BR>So, now it&#39;s Lif and Int is at exactly at 999. &#62;.&#60;; <BR> <BR>So, I saved the game. I went to Promiase to do an Expedition, I&#39;m not sure if you guys already know this. But if your life is 700, that&#39;s ALL you need for an Expedition as I have just found out recently. &#40;That&#39;s how many steps you can walk during an Expedition, so there&#39;s no point in raising it any higher, but I didn&#39;t know that until I raised my Dragon&#39;s LIF and INT to max&#41; <BR> <BR>Since it max Lif and Int, I began searching in buildings, and guess what? Even monsters with 999INT can get lost &#34;easily&#34;. <BR> <BR>And, most of the time, which is about 70%, it seems to be able to find items and encounter enemies. <BR> <BR>The other 30%, it gets lost. So I guess you could say this is the &#34;best&#34; that an Expedition Monster can do, right? &#42;nods and shrugs&#42; I guess so. <BR> <BR>Other than that, when my XtalDragon &#40;who I call Sovereign&#41; reached Yr 4, it also received a warning, saying that it needs to be retired, etc. <BR> <BR>If you have any other questions, fell free to post them here. As my for Expedition Monster, the other stats were under 300. Except Def, which is over 700.  <BR> <BR>So, it was a Tank-monster. XD That&#39;s all I have found out, during my experiment.

 I had a 500 INT, 999 LIF Lesione and probably posted the recommendation, for 500 LIF and 999 INT instead, that you remembered, for just that reason. <BR> <BR>This is just a theory but: <BR>I went exploring with a maxed golem and had great success with items and not getting lost. <BR>I explored every building &#40;clockwise, starting near the start&#41; on the map.  I would continue searching a building until he returned empty handed once and then would move on to the next bulding.  Goldenboy had recommended moving on more frequently to prevent getting lost &#40;not trying to put words in his mouth&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m NOT saying if a monster returns empty handed they will get lost or there isn&#39;t anything left to find.  That is not true. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t tried the Observer trait yet but thats supposed to help.  I helped contribute where to find items on the maps and that should help also.

 Observer trait doesn&#39;t keep you from getting lost, or finding things more often.  It lets you find rarer things.  For example, there&#39;s a temple in Malkt that gives mint candy for the most part, I believe.  With my Arrowhead with observer, though, I got mint candies, luck stars, def charms, and some various stones.  It really stinks when your monster gets lost after getting all those items, though. <BR> <BR>And the perfect expedition monster would be maxed out in every stat, have some good combat traits, and the obsever trait.  =P
