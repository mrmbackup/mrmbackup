 I&#39;m currently raising an Antlan/Gitan, and I was shooting for the Crescent move to add to his list.  The move table here says that the requirement is 600 Speed, but when I checked in with it, she said it was highly unlikely that I&#39;d get it &#40;I tried a few times anyway, to no avail&#41;.  I&#39;ve tried again at 700 Speed, and still no response.  Is there a mistake in the table, or is there something I&#39;m doing wrong?

 There may be another factor that we don&#39;t have yet. It&#39;s hard to nail it down to just one certain thing when you can&#39;t peek at the code. Now that your Spd is high enough try raising a stat that would be complementary to the move. Since it is a Cut tech, you might try raising Acc. <BR> <BR>No promises as I am having trouble with my current Pixie getting any moves at all.

 This may just be a wild guess, but it seems to me that your own coaches make the likeliness of a new tech to go up. If I use my super-coaches, at least one of the areas of sparring says it&#39;ll be hard. Maybe that&#39;s the unknown factor; the super-coaches. The game tell you get get them, right?

 Monster Rank is still a bigger factor in tech acquisition than  <BR>stats. You never said what rank he was Nate, but if it was C  <BR>or better, then meeting the Stat requirement should mean  <BR>you could get the tech. Just for reference here is my priority  <BR>list for things that help you get a tech: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Rank <BR>2&#41; Coach &#40;homemade with 999 in the stat is best&#41; <BR>3&#41; Stat &#40;this is almost a tie with Coach&#41; <BR>4&#41; Winning the fight &#40;hard to do vs an uber coach, but even  <BR>lasting longer than one punch is helpful&#41; <BR> <BR>Pattongeneral- the ingame supercoaches are simply there  <BR>to give you an early leg up when you don&#39;t have time/ <BR>money to make better ones. When you get into the area of  <BR>Hi level stats and techs, those coaches more than likely  <BR>won&#39;t even be eligible to teach you any more, since you&#39;ll  <BR>have passed them by then.

 Yoink is at Rank C, though perhaps I&#39;ll try again at B or A.  In the meantime, maybe I&#39;ll try this Scissors thing...

 I&#39;m trying to get PetalWhirl for my Mocchi.  It&#39;s a Rank C monster and has 600&#43; in ACC.   <BR>Everytime I take Mocchi with me, the girl at the Sparring center says &#34;you will most likely&#34; to learn a new move.  My mocchi doesn&#39;t learn anything after the sparring.  I&#39;ve reloaded several times and still doesn&#39;t get the tech.   <BR> <BR>Does anybody have any idea why this is happening?

 Argh!  OMG!  Finally, after more than 5 times of trying, my mocchi learned Head Butt, in a Tech Sparring.   <BR> <BR>If memory serves me correctly, Head Butt is one of the basic moves.  Doesn&#39;t that mean you need to get all the basic moves first?

 To answer as simply as I can: &#34;Yes.&#34; <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know why you had such difficulty learning the move though, basic moves, as a general rule, seemed go_once_and_get to me. <BR> <BR>To help you avoid this &#40;so you can save money and lifespan&#41;, I can reccomend this to you: <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher Advance 2 Archive &#40;GameBoy Advance&#41;: The Studio &#40;Combining/Breeding&#41;: Combining for more techs
