 I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on how the trainers work. I&#39;ve noticed &#40;as I&#39;m sure you all have&#41; that you can put a trainer in a specific training and get the message &#39;he seems to be well-suited for this training&#39; or &#39;He doesn&#39;t seem suited for this training&#39;. While I haven&#39;t done any sort of examination on numbers to see what bonuses and penalties these make, I can assume that you get better numbers if they&#39;re well-suited, and worse if they aren&#39;t &#40;well d&#39;uh, Kurasu!&#41;. However, what I&#39;m looking for proof on is what trainers are and aren&#39;t good in. <BR> <BR>For instance, I have a hengar at the moment that I was trying to raise for a defense trainer. His stats are 621/717/593/152/951/989. His gains are B/A/B/C/D/D. And when I try him on trainings, he seems &#39;really suited&#39; to Skill &#40;A&#41; and Intelligence &#40;B&#41;, and doesn&#39;t seem suited to Defense and Life &#40;both D&#41;, which are quite obviously his highest stats. That would suggest that at B-A, they&#39;d be &#39;suited&#39;. However, the score is neutral at Power, which he&#39;s also at a &#39;B&#39; in.  <BR> <BR>If people could give me a hand with this and post up trainer breeds &#40;main breed and sub-breed... wouldn&#39;t mind knowing if it has any effect&#41;, present stats, and what trainings they&#39;re paticularly good in, it&#39;d be most appreciated. I want to see if the pattern is in the numbers, in the stat gain, in both, or what. It&#39;d be nice to have a good, solid list of what monsters are good for what trainings, after all.

 &#42;bump&#42; <BR> <BR>Ok, guys? I had some advantages with the MR2 baseline stats, thanks to the CD list and some advance studies. I kinda don&#39;t have as much basis here. Which means I&#39;ll have 512 monsters to go through on my own. As opposed to 408 with some help. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got 6 purebreeds checked &#40;Arrowhead, Durahan, Garu, Hengar, Raiden, Zan&#41;, three crosses &#40;Nagi/Mocchi, Suzarin/Golem, Tiger/Hare&#41;, and two special breeds &#40;Torridon Ducken, Valkyrie Pixie&#41;. Can anyone add to this with some trainers of theirs? It only takes a minute or so to check.

 Sure, Kurasu.  I am not sure if this is the info you want &#40;if it isn&#39;t, the mods can go ahead and delete this post&#41;, but here goes nothing: <BR> <BR>Archreaper &#40;Joker/Sp-L&#41; <BR>Pow Int Acc Spd Def Lif <BR>727 999 999 999 521 999 <BR> <BR>Great with&#42;:  <BR>All except for Body Blow <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>Fair Moch &#40;Mocchi/Gali&#41; <BR>Pow Int Acc Spd Def Lif <BR>585 999 999 999 344 999 <BR> <BR>Great with: <BR>All of them for some odd reason <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>White Mew &#40;Mew/Sp&#41; <BR>Pow Int Acc Spd Def Lif <BR>574 792 639 609 494 506 <BR> <BR>Great with: <BR>All of them like Fair Moch &#40;I kid you not&#41;. <BR> <BR>--- <BR> <BR>&#42;According to Fran in AGIMA. <BR> <BR>Yeah, I am wondering how could my Fair Moch and White Mew be sitable for each drill where as my Archreaper is great with everyone, but body blow. <BR>My guess are either certain subs determine the coaches effectiveness &#40;Remember how you started out with a Mocchi/Gali in the beginning of mra2?&#41;, or the breeds stat might be partly responsible for their usefulness. <BR> <BR>  However, the problem with my stat gain argument is that Mew and Mocchi are lousy with gaining points in Def.  Sorry if this doesn&#39;t help you with anything.

 It&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m looking for, Gizmo. I hadn&#39;t considered that a monster might not be &#39;good&#39; in all the different trainings. I&#39;d been assuming if it was good in one Defense-first training, it was good in both of them &#40;for instance&#41;. I&#39;ll have to look back and see.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also inclined to agree: the subs do seem to have some definite effect on things. I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s because of stat gains or breed-specific advantages, though.

 I tend to agree with that estimate too, but I distinctly remember that the first coach &#40;that mocchi&#41; was not good or bad at any drill. I only remember because I was new to assigning a coach and I tried him in everything.
