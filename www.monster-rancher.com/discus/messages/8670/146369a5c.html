 My monsters weight went to &#34;slim&#34; from &#34;normal&#34; after loading the game. I suspect this has something to do with the &#34;Nevertired Method&#34; in which stats like fatigue and stress are altered every time you save and load the game; maybe it affects other stats like weight. <BR> <BR>It was straight off the shrine, rarely fought and its stats are as follows <BR> <BR>Monster: Lesione &#40;named &#34;Plesio&#34;&#41; <BR>Age: 2yr, 2mo. Reliance : 100 &#40;Spoilt&#41; <BR>Stats: POW = 255 INT = 209 ACC = 217 SPD = 114 DEF = 107 LIF = 104 <BR>Traits: Up water, Up earth and popular. <BR> <BR>Another thing that shoud be noted: its weight was &#34;slim&#34; for several previous weeks, which i had been trying to get back up to normal by feeding dodorin every week. it only just got to normal on the week in question, as well as it already being full upon loading &#40; i thought maybe i just made a mistake and forgot this weeks dodorin, but apparently i hadn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>I will try and reproduce this when i get the chance, but if anyone has similar experiences i would love to hear it.

 I just have one final question about this: does it only happen if you fed the monster a weight affecting item recently or does it change its weight a little bit every time you load the game regardless of what items it gets?

 Every time you reload, points are added to form and subtracted from fatigue and stress. This is separate from the effects of items or foods.

 That&#39;s not quite what i mean. I&#39;ll give a scenario. <BR> <BR>Lets say you just got a monster straight from the shrine, its had no items, no monthly feeding, no training, rest or anything that could affect its weight. Now, we take said monster to the ranch and start the save, load, save etc process. This monster has had no alteration to its weight ever in its life, will it still lose/gain weight by repeating this process? <BR> <BR>The reason i ask is because the stress/fatigue change requires an alteration to that variable &#40;cups/gems&#41; so do other affected stats require a similar process to start.

 It is exactly as I stated. <BR> <BR>The load itself decreases stress numbers and fatigue numbers , and adds to form numbers. These attributes are all expressed in the software as numbers which have minimum and maximum values. <BR> <BR>A new baby has no stress or fatigue, that is, it has reached the lowest possible number the game has available, so loading again and again cannot change the stress/fatigue numbers of the newborn. <BR> <BR>But, a newborn won&#39;t be born as fat as possible, the form number will be someplace in the middle of the values scale allowed. Since loading will add form numbers to a baby, it will get fat eventually. Once a newborn gets to a maximum fatness, more loading is pointless as no other numbers will be affected.

 Ok thanks. But it&#39;s not always adding to form when you load; sometimes it subtracts like in my case. Any known reason behind this or was it an isolated case?

You stated that in your first post that your monster went from <B>&#34;slim&#34; from &#34;normal&#34;</B>. Normal is in the middle of the scale between fat and skinny, thus form was added to it, as you saw when it went from slim to normal. <BR> <BR>skinny_____slim_____normal_____chubby_____fat <BR>every move up this chart is &#43;1 form -----&#62; <BR> <BR>If a monster stays the &#39;same&#39; for a few weeks, it&#39;s because there are several &#40;more like 5-6&#41; increments between each stage.

 You misread my message. It says TO slim FROM normal. Perhaps i should have phrased it more clearly. <BR> <BR>I will look into this again when i can, but since i&#39;m juggling two jobs, multimedia study at tafe, and redoing year eleven it will not be realistic to expect results in anything less than several months.

 Each monster has its own natural weight migration.  Some get skinnier on a normal day and some get fatter. <BR> <BR>  Regardless, the idea is the same; all stats that are affected on a week to week basis can be affected by reloading.  When you reload, the week&#39;s number effects are added in again, most particularly from items.  Weight can be affected in either direction depending on the monster and the phase of his life.

 Hmm... that makes sense, but since a weight GAIN on loading is rare, and i&#39;m the only case of weight loss &#40;to my knowledge&#41; it would still seem like certain conditions must be present before these changes occur. <BR> <BR>At any rate it would seem that it is either a tiny change that few notice &#40;1 or 2 points&#41; or simply not as common a change as other stats like fatigue and stress. <BR> <BR>I will work mostly with Lesione/Tigers since that breed is the one that it occured with.

&#42;Edit. <BR> <BR>Just realised what i said. It was a normal lesione that was <I>named</I> Plesio &#40;name of the subbreed which i didn&#39;t know at the time of naming&#41;. Sorry, this sometimes confuses me as well.

 Aha! I knew i was missing something. The stress/fatigue change requires a permanent altering item &#40;cup/gem&#41; to take effect right? Well then what is the trigger for weight? If what Thorr says is correct, then i could just save/load repeat and eventually get a change &#40;will test this asap&#41;. But if this is the case then why are there so few reports? Surely with a method as well known as this there would be more people noticing. <BR> <BR>I feel this needs more investigation to get a definitive answer, but it&#39;s certainly very close to solved.{thoughts to self} &#40;perhaps the lazy man method of disassembling the game?&#41;
