 Never done this kind of thing before, but here it goes... <BR> <BR>First of all, this thing works best with artificials, namely Mew, Golem, Henger, and Durahan. I&#39;ve never tried it with Zan. <BR> <BR>Note: As with most methods this works best with 2nd gen, all those starting techs, higher stats, better traits, and a possible 40 loyalty. <BR> <BR>Stuff you need/need to know: <BR> <BR>Traits: The traits you&#39;ll want for best stats are Hi Power, Hi speed, Hi IQ, Hi Stamna, Hi Aim <BR>If possible get Elite. Raise a dummy or two while waiting for doctor Kohak, or raise those dummies, get the traits, and combine, hopefully they&#39;ll carry over. <BR> <BR>Items: The best durables, enough flowers to max out loyalty in 1 week&#40;only works if your monster is neutral or higher with flowers, this step is not required&#41;, alot of Mint candy, Mint leaf and nitro berry. <BR> <BR>Coaches: Morgan, Aegis, Arthur, 2 of those 3, plus one of your best self trained ones, or just the 3 supercoaches if possible. <BR> <BR>Basic tips/rules: Enter as few battles as possible in the beginning of it&#39;s life span&#40;try to only battle at officials, later on you can massacre the big 4&#41;, don&#39;t spar until your monster is around 6 months or in desperate need of a new tech. Don&#39;t let your monster fail. Don&#39;t go on expeditions! Don&#39;t let your monster run away&#40;this shouldn&#39;t happen anyway&#41;, if it does, restart you GBA, and keep going. <BR> <BR>Now, on to the actual training part. <BR> <BR>Week 1: &#40;not a requirement but highly recommended&#41; Flowers! Enough to max out your monsters loyalty. You can give flowers as much as you want in a week so I took advantage of this. If you have the loyalty, good enough stats, and a good tech enter an Official tourney asap. This won&#39;t work if you monster is anything below nuetral with flowers&#40;i.e., they don&#39;t like &#39;em!&#41; <BR> <BR>Training order: I always do hard drills, It seems to maximize results, if someone wants they can test light drills. Raise stats in this order: Best, Second best, Second worst, Third best, ignore the third worst and the worst for a bit, those should get pretty high with the secondary gains. Follow the statgains from Tecmo thing. Once your monsters first 3 stats get to 950, start focusing more on the others, stats when you start this should be something like this: 950,950,950,700,500,350 &#40;the composite is already 4,450, yay!&#41;. Eventually when your stats are something like 999,999,999,500,999,800, focus on the lowest one, let one of your 999&#39;s drop to 984, then train that stat to 999 again. <BR> <BR>Sparring: If your monster has it&#39;s 3 best techs, you don&#39;t need to spar. Only spar when your monster is over 6 months, or really needs a stronger tech. <BR> <BR>Resting: Rest when your monster seems well or seems tired&#40;obvious&#41;. <BR> <BR>Stress: Feed stress releiving items&#40;duh&#41;, then rest/battle, depending on what your monster likes or can handle, if it &#34;seems well&#34; or lower, don&#39;t battle. Feed stress releiving items for one week&#40;rest only for the first one though&#41; <BR> <BR>Battling: Only battle when your monster is really energetic, or if it likes to fight, you can battle when it is pretty lively. <BR> <BR>Food: If your monster has a 2 or higher liking for bananas, feed those throughout it&#39;s life, if it has less, just rotate to keep it at a normal figure, and try to keep your monster happy and unstressed.  <BR> <BR>Spoiled: Spoil your monsters, they tend to live longer that way. <BR> <BR>Using this method I find that about 4 of 5 monsters hit their &#34;crucial period&#34; over 1y3m <BR> <BR>My best with this: <BR>White Mew, Normal size,1st gen, spoilt, 87 wins, 0 losses&#40;he beat all the E class tourneys,and the big 4, the rest were officials&#41;, master class, 100 loyalty, 4y7m&#40;at first warning&#41;, techs:all, traits:Hi IQ, Hi Aim, Hi Speed, Hi power, Charisma, Satori, stats: P:979 I:999 A:999 S:999 D:653 L:999 Composite:5,628 I have tried battling like that with other Mews and it doesn&#39;t work, they all lived to about 4y1m, this one fluked with the so many battles. The password for it was Nig_Cat starting stats: P:123 I:174 A:180 S:191 D:118 L:120, traits: BigVoice, Up Head <BR> <BR>Okay GB, hand out some mallets and squash those bugs! <BR> <BR>P.S: Is this thing understandable? Is this how it should look? Is all the information there? If not, tell me whats&#39;s wrong or what&#39;s missing.

 I&#39;m glad to see a posted a method!  It looks pretty good. <BR>Its strange but I haven&#39;t tried just letting a monster become spoiled before &#40;too much MR2 I guess&#41;.  The order you trained the stats was interesting.  I&#39;ve been training the mediocre stats until the &#34;important stage warning&#34; before working on the monster&#39;s best &#40;again, due to MR2 influence&#41;. <BR>I&#39;d like to see a sample schedual of exactly what your Mew did and ate each week for the first months or two &#40;those are tricky&#41;.  How you dealt with Glutton would also be interesting to know. <BR> <BR>Thanks for sharing the info.

 Yah, I should mention though, if you can&#39;t get elite you should get IronHeart for a trait, also don&#39;t forget to use oily oils. These 2 things together will expand training time greatly. I used to train the mediocre ones first too but it was just not working so I tried this and have been doing great with it so far.

 Hmmmm...I forgot to mention that that was the Mew I unlocked the Mew legends with...so add those battles in&#40;still the same record, just those shouldn&#39;t add up to 87&#41;. As for what I did for the first 2 months...what exactly do you mean for a schedule? week 1:... week2:... week3:...etc? As for what he ate, that&#39;s easy, bannanas throughout his entire life&#40;I mean ENTIRE&#41;. As for glutton...he never had the chance to get glutton. I got him all those Hi traits and within his first 3 or 4 training sessions he got the other 2. Hopefully I can remember what he did for the first month or 2, I&#39;ve already trained one monster after him and my memory isn&#39;t too great with those kinds of things.

 It doesn&#39;t have to be that Mew in particular.  You said you used hard-drills almost exclusively, right? What I was asking was: <BR>How many drills did you get in before needing to rest? <BR>What did you feed to get this? <BR> <BR>If I&#39;m reading this correct you never saw Glutton because you already had 6 traits &#40;correct?&#41;.  I believe Golden Boy was looking into this once.

 I usually got about 3 drills before needing rest throughout his life, I didn&#39;t really feed anything to him to help him along, just an oily oil every once in awhile. As for the hard drills...that&#39;s all I used...except for one drill, I was clicking through too fast and did an easy one. And yes he had 6 traits early on so I never saw glutton.
