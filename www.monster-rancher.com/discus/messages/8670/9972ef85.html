 Thank my monster trainin&#39; SO for this test.  <BR> <BR>We got curious about whether mint candy might help both stress and fatigue on monsters, since I&#39;ve seen times that it seemed to. He decided to give it a test. All three of these are the same arrowhead, fed on potatoes &#40;two squares of liking&#41; during the entire test. They did nothing but light drills &#40;basic power&#41; the entire time. No failures, no greats. He is normal weight, and hasn&#39;t hit the &#39;most important stage&#39; yet. <BR> <BR>Control: One full months before the first &#39;a little tired&#39;. No stress warnings at all in that time. Stressed the next week. <BR> <BR>Mint Leaf: One full month before the first &#39;a little tired&#39;. No stress warnings at all in that time.  <BR> <BR>Mint candy: One month and two weeks before the first &#39;a little tired&#39;. No stress warnings at all. <BR> <BR>I did the same test, using a Hare Hound. He has hit the &#39;most important stage&#39; warning. His liking for potatoes is one square &#40;&#39;might have been a little harsh&#39;&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Control: One month before the first &#39;a little tired&#39;. Also showed stress on the fourth day &#40;because of the potatoes&#41;. Please note: mine &#39;likes very much&#39; the mint candy, so this mey be skewing the results slightly.  <BR> <BR>Mint Leaf: One month before the first &#39;a little tired&#39;. No stress warnings in that month. After another full month of training &#40;worn out&#41;, still no stress warnings. However, I couldn&#39;t get him to succeed after that point no matter how hard I tried &#40;four tries went to failure&#41; <BR> <BR>Mint Candy: Two months and one week before the first &#39;a little tired&#39;. No stress warnings at all in that time. After another full month of &#39;seems tired&#39; &#40;never dipping into tired, where the mint leaf&#39;ed hare hound went almost immediately in&#41;, no stress either. <BR> <BR>&#39;Nuff said.

 Good test. Can you clarify how the Arrowhead liked mint candy or not? And possibly note any effects on form? I know eventually they will fatten up a monster. as well as spoil it. Iim prepared to counter both with vitamins and newts, but I think those effect should be noted here too.

 Also, did the arrowhead have Glutton? <BR>And did you both mix up the light drills or do the same one for the whole test? <BR> <BR>I ask the second because I have noticed some varying effects between different drills. <BR>I love your results, I just want to note all factors. Glutton would explain why the arrowhead didn&#39;t go as long.

 No particular liking for either the mint leaf or mint candy. The arrowhead was completely indifferent to both, the tiger was indifferent to the mint leaf and liked the candy &#40;as reported&#41;. I&#39;m sure they would have fattened him up, though. In the short time we tested, there was no change in the arrowhead &#40;though that&#39;s only a week and a couple days&#41;, and I didn&#39;t check it on my tiger &#40;I got too excited once it passed the first month at &#39;lively&#39;&#41;. Definite spoilage on the tiger &#40;because if the liking&#41;. The arrowhead, no. Definitely get the newts ready, though... especially if the monster likes mint candy. <BR> <BR>As for the arrowhead, no. He didn&#39;t have glutton on him. Neither did the tiger. They were both &#39;normal&#39; weight, no glutton.  <BR> <BR>The drills were done as &#39;power&#39; &#40;shove&#41; on both. No mixing. The exact same drill on the monsters. That could have made a difference, since the tiger&#39;s hare side could make it more tuned to power training than the arrowhead. I figured it was the age that did it.

 With more good information like this and a bit more work on the lifespan research, the raising methods will start developing.  I can&#39;t wait.  Sorry I&#39;ve been away for so long, I hope to start posting more info myself soon. <BR>Good job, Karasu.
