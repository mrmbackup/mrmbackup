 how do i make it so when i go sparring they dont say &#34;it is highly unlikely your monster will learn a new move&#34;?

 From my experience, coaches like Morgan and Arther seem to help your monster give you better techs than the defaults AGIMA offer you.  So far, I&#39;ve seen my Suzurins, Gitan, and XtalDragon gain at LEAST one tech from them.  I think the Mocchi Holly gives you, and Gavin&#39;s Golem Strong might also help you gain some attacks, but I&#39;ll have to check on it.

 The percentage chance of acquiring new skills is directly related to your Stats.  For instance, If I do Sparring in Strength at STR 200, I will probably get a &#34;It will be hard..&#34; message. If you go back with STR 450, you will get a &#34;It is Likely..&#34; message. <BR>  Acquiring skills is like trying to hit your enemy in a battle.  You can still hit him, even with a chance of only 15%, it will just take a lot of luck.  New skills are the same way.  A &#34;Highly Unlikely...&#34; means that you have about 10-20% chance of getting a new move.  It can happen, but chances are slim.  What gets me going is that the reverse is also true.  Your chances may be 85% or better and you can still come out with nothing.  it&#39;s like trying to hit a confused monster.  When you miss him, it really ticks you off!!! <BR>  Gizmo is right as well - Better coaches will give better chances, too. <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 About sparring, you also have to be about the same level or weaker than your coach. If you are too strong, it wil be unlikely that you can learn a new move.

 That&#39;s not true at all.  I spar with my best coaches all the time.  I take my Class E monsters and put them up against my Master Rank Durahan for training.  I get better chances than I do against the assigned coaches.  I usually see different messages after I select them.  Sure, my young monsters get wasted in one shot, but for every time I hit them, they get better stats and a better chance of getting a move. <BR> <BR>  The essesnce of MRA2 is the coaching system.  The best thing you could do for your ranch is get the best possibe coaches.  It&#39;s the best way to get top stats and a full compliment of Skills. <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 To get this back on topic, I&#39;ll post something I  <BR>noticed about sparring. <BR> <BR>A big part about learning techs in MRA2 is not  <BR>just stats, but monster class. I think certain I  <BR>checked the difficulty of getting a new move  <BR>immediately before and after Class A Official.  <BR>and I had gone fre very hard on all but one to  <BR>havin a Good chance in INT. I don&#39;t know if it  <BR>makes tachs available or what, but it boils down  <BR>to this. TRAIN EARLY LEARN LATER. Don&#39;t sweat it  <BR>if you dont have the moves right away get them  <BR>later on and save money and wear and tear.

 I found, that when I sparred, instead of a skill, I got a trait, for my Guardian &#40;Antlan/Garu, I think&#41; <BR>I got Hi Aim.  <BR>Next time though, I got a skill, X Blade. <BR>Why? Are you supposed to get traits from sparring? I thought just skills.

 Sure u can get Traits and also i -Think-  that if you are going to get a trait you must get that trait first BEFORE the skill.  I base this on that Wehn i sent my PrePee to Tough Training it sed its hard to get an attack. so then i thought i got one..but it said Trait.  So i figured why not reset and try again.  I Tried 7 Times. I got the Trait each time. Then i saved the trait and went again. Then and only then did i get the attack... &#42;sigh&#42; im no the one to ask about training... it confuses me so. <BR> <BR>-SuZu <BR> <BR>P.S u can also get Traits from Hard Drills

 Traits are acquired from the coaches or teachers  <BR>that do the drill or spar. They are entirely  <BR>independent of the tech tree. <BR> <BR>The reason you got the trait so often is the  <BR>chance for that teacher to pass to your monster  <BR>was very high. Also, completing that first  <BR>sparring probably raised that stat enough to  <BR>increase your chance of getting the move. <BR> <BR>In MRA2 as I have said getting moves is based  <BR>more on your class than on your stats. <BR>the formula is probably similar to this <BR> <BR>chance to get move= &#40;stat lvl&#41;&#43; &#40;monster class&#41;&#43;  <BR>&#40;Ranch coach bonus&#41;

But, then, I have had two monsters so far hear the unlikely warning and get KO&#39;d without even touching the teacher, and <I>still</I> get techs. I think it&#39;s like MRA, there&#39;s simply a random factor to it.

 ok some of my coaches don&#39;t want to spar in the places i need them to...like my garu. &#40;garu is the coach my monster trying to train is a durahan&#41;the garu coach which has high attack &#92; high skill &#92; high defense and even high speed will only spar at int. which it only had like 50 points in int. when signed up. how do I change them to a diffarent sparring area

 You have no control over sparring. The better you  <BR>coach is the more areas he will appear and the  <BR>longer he will be able to fight your monster.  <BR>once. Charisma MAY have an effect on this but it  <BR>is unverified. The game decides when you are  <BR>better than your coach and can no longer spar  <BR>against him.

 I don&#39;t know if anyone has noticed this or even cares, but while selecting your coach, if there is 2 &#40;I dont&#39; know if this is necessary&#41;coaches in a section, the sparring facilities coaches stats will change if you flip through them. This doesn&#39;t work with your monsters or hired coaches that I&#39;ve noticed. The biggest stat difference I have seen is 60 points.

 The number of coaches available varies based on how many you have under contract that can teach in that stat. <BR> <BR>If you look at the HELP for the Sparring choice on your ranch Holly will mention that coaches can teach until you pass them in ability. <BR> <BR>The stats vary for the AGIMA teachers because it applies a formula with a random element to you monster. It bases the stats of the teacher on your monster.

 I read that if you lose badly, you have a worse chance of getting a trait. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s entirely true, becuase I was training my Wolfkin against my XtalDragon coach, who had 712 POW and the Wolfkin was at almost base &#40;barely any training, training &#60; 1 year&#41; stats, and well, one Trample did close to 999 damage.  <BR>It got a skill from it. And I did it again, a few months later, and it got another skill. <BR>&#40;Sild Combo, and the fire kick&#41; <BR>Was that simply luck, and if I did it a few more times, it would prove me wrong, or maybe, does getting beaten badly help you get skills?

To Mewger: there&#39;s a difference between what you wrote and the way it works. You don&#39;t make your chances worse by losing, your chances improve the better you do. <BR> <BR>You have a base chance, based on you stats and rank. This can be improved by winning in the the sparring match. <BR> <BR>No matter what you will always have that base chance, as long as you are eligible for a new move.

 That&#39;s supposition, unless you can run a conclusive test I don&#39;t buy it. <BR> <BR>Winning in the sparring match improves your chances, your monsters rank improves your chances, you monster&#39;s score in that stat improves your chances, and  using a coach instead of a teacher improves your chances.  <BR> <BR>The techs you use in the match have nothing to do with it IMO.

 Can it be stated with certainty that many techniques have rank requirements?  If so can these be included in tech lists? <BR> <BR>I suppose that would require maxing &#40;or almost maxing&#41; a monster&#39;s stats, keeping it E-Rank, and then attempting to gain as many moves as possible.  But I believe after just afew techs all sparring catagories would become &#34;highly unlikely&#34; until another rank is achieved. <BR> <BR>Oh, and I suppose this only makes sense for monsters created at the shrine from passwords.

 Yup kinda pointless since techs can be passed on, given early because of a password, or earned early if your stats are sufficiently high. I&#39;m not sure about the last but it would be easy to test.

 all i have to say is that how well you do does affect stat gains. If i let arther whoop the stuffings out of my Chaos head, he gets &#43;18-24 pow stat gain, but once i managed do do like 100 damage to Arther and keep Chaos above 300 hp out of 570 or something and Chaos got &#43;43 to pow! So i would try my best on all sparring since i think it also affects techs in a good way. <BR>Aren&#39;t you all happy when you get a trait and a move on the same sparring? <BR>speaking of which, i was raising a mew to get an eared mew&#40;you know, doing all those int. only tournaments?&#41;, and it had Zap, my only way of winning, and all six stats, satori was one, but no up beams. I wanted up beams reeeeaaaalll bad, so i removed up counter, since i never used it with my mew, and sparred against Ageas hoping like mad  that he would pass on Up Beams, and voila! i got up beams! it was so cool, and just in time for a tournament, too! I don&#39;t really expect anyone to take this seriously, but does sometimes it seem that hoping madly can make things better, but sometimes the game just has it all against you when you kind of want something? in any game.

 I have seen what I think is a weird situation to do with Sparring.  <BR> <BR>I took my dragon to Spar &#40;saving the game beforehand&#41;. Well because I hadn&#39;t taken him to Spar for a while almost every coach said I was &#34;good chance&#34; or &#34;likely&#34; to gain a tech. So I thought I&#39;d pick and choose which tech I wanted.  <BR> <BR>I tried Power -- got the Wing Cut tech. Since it was INT-based I didn&#39;t really want it at the time so I tried again with Sense -- got the Wing Cut tech. Argh. So I tried AGAIN under Speed. You guessed it ... Wing Cut. That was the ONLY tech that it would teach me, regardless of coach.

 I have a small bit of info that I thought I&#39;d add to this thread. Sometimes when I send a monster to spar, it comes back only &#34;a little tired&#34; instead of being fully tired. I&#39;ve seen this with quite a few monsters of mine, most recently, a Monol/Gitan &#40;don&#39;t have my GBA with me&#41;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know whether or not this can be reproduced on demand; if so, it might help reduce the lifespan lost from the sparring. What&#39;s weird about it is that I&#39;ve seen this even if my monster gets K.O.ed. And, after getting the K.O., but not the tech, I would go to reload, &#40;for the tech&#41; complete sparring and get the tech, and my monster would come out of the sparring tired.
