 Ok, so maybe the title doesn&#39;t really deserve the exclamation, and this might be posted somewhere else &#40;I checked the Q&amp;A though!&#41; but I wanted to share some passwords I found that give certain traits. <BR>When I was doing the little Octopee expiriment, I used the password Promiass. <BR>Well- Out of curiosity, I just decided to change the first letter to something else. &#40;A different capital letter&#41;  <BR>The Octopee that I got with the Promiass password had the Expert trait.  <BR>Well, so did the monster I got with the new password. And all the other capital letters. <BR>And I also know that all the passwords that have -romiass with the - being a capital letter, give either Antlan subs or pures. &#40;Not all Antlan subs or pures were there, I think some might be in the lowercase and symbols&#41; <BR>I don&#39;t know why Antlan, but they do. I&#39;ve only unlocked Dragon- and several of the capital letter passwords were locked for me, but I&#39;m pretty sure the Antlan pattern will continue. <BR>I have yet to try out the lowercase letters or the symbols. <BR>Also, I found a Hariluro with the password ShiShi. I think that any capital letter in fron of the -hiShi will give you a monster with Success. So far I&#39;ve done a few of the letters, not all because it takes a lot of time. But enough to be pretty sure.  <BR>Well, that&#39;s all I have, but if anyone else has some passwords that give certain traits, it&#39;d be great to post them here, because it&#39;ll really help me out, along with anyone who wants a monster with a certain trait, but can&#39;t get it. Ok, that&#39;s it.

 For some reason, mutating a password usually gets a monster with a common stat or trait. <BR>For instance, Northwes gets you a creature with Up Wind. other -orthwes creatures also have Up Wind.

 Mutating doesn&#39;t give the trait, its just part of the way MR determines the monster and its abilities. This phenomenon happens because the first characters are used to determine the breed and the latter characters determine its stats and traits. <BR> <BR>That said, I am well aware that changing middle characters will effect the breed. This is because the password coding is an additive process, and changing any character effects how the others are interpreted, except in the case of the first character &#40;which only seems to effect main breed&#41;. <BR> <BR>Note that this effect works not just for Traits, but for higher than normal stats too. There are some passwords out there &#40;Ramses comes to mind&#41; where the stats are abnormally high, and this carries to all mutations of &#42;amses. The reason commone traits appear is because the password system is only set up to generate those traits. The only way to get advanced traits on new monsters is by combining or from a book monster. <BR> <BR>The only way a book monster will have the advanced traits is if you combine for them and the child has them. This is mentioned in the FAQ when Lisa warns against entering a lot of passwords ASAP. It pays off to leave a few choice breeds open to get good traits on the book version. <BR> <BR>The Legend breeds are a perfect opportunity to make great book monsters. Once you complete the task to open the breed, it is unlocked even if you haven&#39;t put the special password in the shrine. I recommend using the Legendary combinations to make better than average book versions of your Legends, instead of entering passes for them.
