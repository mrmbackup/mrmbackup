 Well, not ALL food, I guess. I am raising a Suzurin. All foods only get 1 box, except for Oranges, Nuts, Dessert, Bananas, and Milk, which all get 3 boxes. However, when I feed one of these to the Suzurin, Holly always gives the dialogue &#34;are you sure you&#39;re doing the right thing?&#34; What am I supposed to feed the little beggar?! Note that she is not a Glutton. Once she was anemic.  <BR> <BR>I have had other monsters whose &#34;best&#34; food was only 3 boxes, and they didn&#39;t always give the negative Holly dialogue. Should I be trying to feed the Suzurin dietary supplements to make up for this? Or what?

 Usually when Holly says something like, &#34;It likes it, but was it the right decision?&#34; after you give it food, It means your monster is getting fat, or skinny depending on the meal.  If your Suzu gets 3 bars with Milk, go for Milk since it doesn&#39;t seem to affect weight that much &#40;Well, it doesn&#39;t seem to really affect the monster&#39;s weight that much from my experiences imho&#41; from giving it to a couple of monsters. <BR> <BR>What kind of Suzu do you have?  A pure Suzu, a Suzu with a different sub breed &#40;e.g. Suzu/Raiden&#41;, or a rare/legend?  Sometimes, the subs affect the diet. <BR> <BR>Just juggle with your Suzu&#39;s diet.  I raised two of them when I was trying to get a Gitan and a higher rank, and I never encountred that problem.  In case it gets slim or thin during the training month, give it food like cake or wine to gain weight, but if it gets obese, don&#39;t give it diet weed unless it doesn&#39;t care about it.  Give it monthly food items like Nuts to trim it as long as the monster likes that item. <BR> <BR>My Priest &#40;Golem/Sp&#41; was obesese when I started raising him, but as I gave it vitamins each month &#40;My Priest had 3 bars when it came to vitamins&#41;, it started to trim its weight so I decided to give it milk, another monthly food it seemed to like. <BR> <BR>Sorry if this doesn&#39;t help you.  MRA2&#39;s diet system can be onboxious until you get used to it.

 well she is a Shaorin, a Suzurin/?? so a rare I guess. What I&#39;ve been doing is switching off between the five foods she likes, and her weight seems to stay the same so I guess her weight has been going down as much as it&#39;s been going up -- sort of a see-saw dieter ;&#41;
