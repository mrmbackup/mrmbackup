 Hi, I&#39;m new here, well, not really. I used top be here about 2-3 years ago, but erm.. lol. It&#39;s been a while, so I apoligize IF this might be considered as SPAM. <BR> <BR>But, I was wondering what&#39;s everyone&#39;s training method? I&#39;ve been playing MRA2 for quite &#34;some&#34; time now, about half a year or so to be exact. <BR> <BR>And, for some reason, I can&#39;t seem to get my monster&#39;s stats, all of them to over 600. I seem to have trouble doing that, because as it reaches near 600 on all stats, the monster is considered as &#34;retired&#34;. So, so far. I&#39;ve been raising certain monster&#39;s different ways.. for example, my Golem has 999ATK and about 450 Accuracy, 500 Def and 250 Lif. All of the other stats are lower than 200. But that&#39;s just me. I was just wondering how you guys train your monsters, I apologize if this post/thread offends you if my training method is considered as &#34;n00bish&#34; or novice.  <BR> <BR>Thanks to everyone who posts.

 I think I remember &#34;Magnus.&#34; <BR> <BR>1&#41;Do you have good coaches?  Coaches are important. <BR>If you don&#39;t, train monsters with light drills in areas they are good at to create speciallty coaches.  A golem with 999 Pow for example to choach power. <BR>With good coaches it is easier to get great gains &#40;20-30&#41; in areas that monsters aren&#39;t great at. <BR>2&#41;Create better coaches.  Coaches eventually expire.  As your coaches improve it won&#39;t require as many speciallists to make up your coaching team. <BR>3&#41;Be sure to have good equipment &#40;best gemstone, cup, aroma pot, and incense&#41;. <BR>4&#41;Don&#39;t let your monster get tired or stressed.  It happens when aquiring new moves but that is ultimately worth while. <BR>5&#41;Keep form and style normal to prevent easily tiring and stressing.  There is plenty of information here about which items do which. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve found that with awesome coaches very few items are neccessary to max monsters.  I use hard drills almost exclusively.

 ...there is a draw back to specialization I should mention. <BR>Migranes, Strains, Worms, etc... <BR>Doing a single drill and/or feeding a single food over the long term seams to increase the odds of getting sick. <BR>If you visit the doctor regularly it won&#39;t phase you much but it might be wise to mix things up occasionally.

 Thank you very much for informing me on that, I used my Golem AND my Sun &#40;aka Gali&#41; as coaches. My Gali trained my Dragon&#39;s ACC as well as INT, where as my Golem trained my Dragon&#39;s POW, LIF, and DEF. None of my monsters are high in SPD, seeing as how I don&#39;t consider that too improtant IF you have a HUGE monster. Spd won&#39;t effect much in a battle if you have a huge monster anyway, it won&#39;t increase your Guts THAT much as it usually would, but it helps to Evade if I&#39;m correct. But I&#39;m not worried about that. So far, your suggestion proved to be very helpful. Let me show you my Dragon&#39;s stats SINCE I took your advice. &#40;Note that this Dragon is NOT Sharked in anyway&#41; <BR> <BR>Name: Diaboros &#40;Dragon/Joker&#41; <BR>Rank so far: A <BR>Years so far: 2 yr, 7 months <BR>Spoilt <BR>Reliance 100 &#40;I spoil my monsters on purposely, it works for me, 90% of the time, they always get a &#39;Success&#39; during training/drills&#41; <BR> <BR>Attacks so far: D. Tail, D. Bite, Trample, Flutter, Inferno. <BR> <BR>Traits/Abilities: Up Fire, Up Magic, Up IQ, Nearsight, Popular, UpLtning <BR> <BR>POW: 160 <BR>INT: 970 <BR>ACC: 944 <BR>SPD: 47 &#40;Like I said, to me, spd isn&#39;t important. Even if I do lose Guts when I get hit by an INT atk, I&#39;ll regain it sooner and later. One Flutter always kills everything in my path anyway, eeh&#41; <BR>DEF: 334 <BR>LIF: 305 <BR> <BR>So, my strategy is, when battle starts, just use ONE Inferno, it wipes the other monster out. AND, since my Accuracy is around 90%, it almost never misses. I don&#39;t have to worry about much, except IF I face a very fast monster that has high INT as well, lol. <BR> <BR>SInce my Dragon has about 2-3 years left &#40;estimated&#41;, I&#39;m planning to increase his DEF and LIF. POW, not really TOO worried about.  I already have Inferno, Flutter, and high ACC &#43; INT to back me up. <BR> <BR>By year 5, it should have about over 500-600 LIF &#43; DEF, and about 999 INT, and ACC. ^^ So, please post your opinion in on this, I&#39;m sure everyone has their own tactics and views of things. I want to see what everybody&#39;s opinions and views are. <BR> <BR>-Magnus

 Two lvl.19-20 stats definately make the game easier.  I think its easier to achieve three 950&#43; stats than six 500 stats. <BR> <BR>Dragons are great for that but I would be surprised if you manage to get all the remaining attacks and live to the optimistic 5 years 7 months. <BR> <BR>Looking at the FAQ for Dragon/Joker stats: <BR>Gains: <BR>P/I/A/S/D/L <BR>8/8/5/3/5/5 <BR>Maximum Lifespan: <BR>4 years, 11 months, 1 week <BR> <BR>What are you plans for Diaboros?  INT/ACC coach, money monster, unlocking something, a champion?  I find it best to decide on a goal before training a monster.  If your current plan is to max a monster he might not be too helpful.  The fact your monster didn&#39;t turn out better is probably due to coaches &#40;He isn&#39;t bad and can probably beat ANYTHING in game...with a few resets&#41;. For Intelligence coaching it helps to have good ACC/DEF or LIF/POW and for Accuracy coaching INT/SPD or POW/DEF. <BR> <BR>My first Maxed monster didn&#39;t occur until I had these two coaches <BR> <BR>AGENT &#40;Naga/Octopee&#41; <BR>999/324/999/360/436/999 <BR>Upclaws,uphands&#43;,success,popular,upmind,ironhart <BR>ORIMMUS &#40;Gali/Gali&#41; <BR>516/994/525/982/990/480 <BR>Upmind,upiq,popular,hiaim,upearth <BR> <BR>As you can see their stats complimented eachother.  With them I was able to Max a golem/golem to becom my next coach. <BR> <BR>The gali I trained using a method involving only mint candies and hard drills until the first sign of fatigue or stress and then reseting back a week and resting instead.  The Mint Candies were bought in large quantities with a monster who had Charm to cut costs.  I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember what I fed him but it was whatever he liked the most until his loyalty reached 90 and then what ever he licked the least &#40;but not &#34;nothing&#34;&#41; to keep from becoming spoiled. <BR> <BR>The maxed golem didn&#39;t recieve nearly the items the gali did but with the 982 SPD gali coach earned 30 when Hard Drilling SPD in the middle of his life. <BR> <BR>I trained a Moochi/moochi with the gali and naga coaches using items only to keep form and style normal &#40;i.e. mint candies&#41; and it reached over 600 in all six stats leading me to believe that coaches are far more important than raising method. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been meaning to do a raising method write up but haven&#39;t decided if it would be more helpful to start with a shrined monster &#40;0 reliance&#41; or a combination &#40;40 reliance&#41; with 999 coaches or without hard drills at all.  Honestly if you have coaches with 999 everywhere you probably don&#39;t need a write up. <BR> <BR>Just because I&#39;ve maxed a few monsters doesn&#39;t make me a master or anything.  I can&#39;t do it every time.  I still have a hard time with monthly feeding choices in particular.

 EDIT: <BR>I meant to say &#34;&#40;i.e. NO mint candies&#41;&#34; about the moochi. <BR>Its all about the coaches in MRA2. <BR> <BR>Sorry for the long post.  I hope this helps others besides you and I, Magnus.

 Aaah, so I see. So Coaches are helpful in the way that you explained it, I think you pretty much &#34;cleared&#34; everything up when it comes to Coaches. ^^ <BR> <BR>I usually make my own Coaches, such as a DEF/POW Golem, and then an INT/ACC Gali, train them to S or A rank until they almost retired. Then use them BOTH at the same time as Coaches, to train my Dragons. But that&#39;s just me, your method is pretty much the same.. but as for Super Coaches, when do they appear in the game, I wonder..

 As for my Diaboros, let me show you it&#39;s stats and everything now. You &#34;might&#34; be surprised, or you won&#39;t.. but here goes the same exact Diaboros.. this is the stats when it IS retired. <BR> <BR>Name: Diaboros &#40;Dragon/Joker&#41; <BR>Rank so far: MASTER Rank, also beated Dynast <BR>Years so far: 4 yrs, 2 Months <BR>Spoilt <BR>Reliance 100 &#40;I spoil my monsters on purposely, it works for me, 90% of the time, they always get a &#39;Success&#39; during training/drills&#41; <BR> <BR>Attacks so far: D. Tail, D. Bite, Trample, Flutter, Inferno <BR> <BR>Traits/Abilities: Up Fire, Up Magic, Far Sight, Popular, LuckStar, UpLtning <BR> <BR>^I believe it got LuckStar because my Golem trained it, my Golem had LuckStar ability/trait, lol. ^_^ This Dragon is the bomb, this is surely my best monster! <BR> <BR>POW: 306 <BR>INT: 950 <BR>ACC: 962 <BR>SPD: 146  <BR>DEF: 921 <BR>LIF: 654  <BR> <BR>So as you can see, with the same exact Training Method I&#39;ve BEEN doing, it&#39;s working. The thing is, it&#39;s a BIT costly. Involving 2 Coaches, and spars 2-3 times every year. <BR> <BR>So, it shouldn&#39;t cost you TOO much. Plus, once in a while, if he does good during Training, and gets  &#39;Great&#39; as a result of his training, I feed him Mint Candy, or MeatSlab, which is 2 of his favorite food, especially the MeatSlab. I don&#39;t feed him too much, normally, 75% of the time, I feed him Oranges, the other 25% of the time, is Meat. <BR> <BR>So, I try to not spend too much money, but still get the kind of monster that I desire..  <BR> <BR>Please post your comment in on this, I want to hear more opinions about this training method of mine. Is it cheap? Crappy? Pathetic? Etc. <BR> <BR>Thanks, Seize and everyone else. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#91;I also got Ragnarok by combining Monol and Dragon together, but I can&#39;t use him yet, lol. I also have a Diva, lol&#41; &#62;_&#60; Can&#39;t wait to use THOSE Dragons for a test-run.

 Thats a great monster.  Personally, I consider multiplying a monsters statgains by 100 as &#34;par.&#34; <BR>8/8/5/3/5/5 -&#62; 800/800/500/300/500/500 <BR>But you would have probably been dissapointed at having only 500 accuracy.  For that reason I would suggest trying a: Dragster &#40;&#42;/hare&#41; or Lindwurm &#40;&#42;/SP2&#41; as they could have maxed accuracy sooner. <BR> <BR>Once you have a great coach in an area like your Golem &#40;DEF/POW&#41; then you would want to pick monsters that have better stat gains in other areas.  Even though the Dragster and Lindwurm have less power gains they will probably still get 30 in POW. <BR> <BR>I have some questions: <BR>What was the liking Diaboros had for Oranges and Meat &#40;0-4 scale based on orange bars shown and if you can remember it Holly&#39;s comment&#41;? <BR> <BR>Does spoiling monsters really lack a drawback?  I was hoping one would be found in the thread: <BR>Miscellaneous Q&amp;A/Reaserch: Stress and Fatigue  <BR>I haven&#39;t tried it.  I&#39;ll try some things with one monster to see how long it takes to get to its &#34;critical stage.&#34; <BR> <BR>I have the most trouble with monthly feeding.  Especially because it doesn&#39;t display the date when you make your choice.

 Well, to tell you the truth, probably ALL Dragons are the same, except by Traits and Stat Gains.  <BR> <BR>For my Diaboros: <BR> <BR>One Block for Orange <BR>Four Blocks for Meat <BR> <BR>And like I&#39;ve said, I try to &#34;not&#34; spend too much money as well. My Dragon is about Thin-Normal if I&#39;m corrwect, it goes abck and forth like that. I try to not make it Obese or Fat, lol. But, I don&#39;t think weight has any effect on your monster, but that&#39;s just my opinion, I &#34;could&#34; be wrong.  <BR> <BR>Personally, some ppl think that it&#39;s a drawback, or migth ahve a drawback. But to me, it&#39;s a GOOD thing to spoil your monster, since most of them time, it gets Success, and rarely, it gets Great! Once or so, my Dragon did up to 2-3 &#39;great!&#39; at the same time during a Drill.
