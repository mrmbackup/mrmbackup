 I believe I have found a rather beneficial bug in the game... There is a way to be able to never have your monster need rest, except for rarely, when he gets too stressed, and you have already fed him a variety of mint. It goes as follows: <BR> <BR>At the beginning of the week, when Holly gives you your Monster&#39;s status, be sure and not do anything, like go to town, or the shop. You can give items, as you are not actually leaving the ranch. <BR> <BR>Save your game. Load  your game. Save it again. Load it again. Save it again, after the load. Load it again. Save it again, after the load. Load it again. Your monster&#39;s fatigue will gradually lessen, until it reaches the &#39;Seems really energetic stage, at which point you can train, or fight, or spar as you will... After which, you&#39;l be at the beginning of another week.

 I have noticed this phenomena, moving from a  <BR>little tired to the step above that. I didn&#39;t  <BR>think it went all the way back to energetic.  <BR>Since I was in the process of reloading 10&#43; times  <BR>to get a fight and I never made it better tahn  <BR>one stage and on other reloads it went back down  <BR>iirc. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s cool, but I don&#39;t know how many people are  <BR>motivated enough to reload 20 times just to  <BR>advance one week. Nor do i think it can be too  <BR>good for your cartridge in the long run. <BR> <BR>With some verified buggy carts out there already,  <BR>this might make them worse, extreme caution if  <BR>you decide to do this on a regular basis.

 Just did some testing, and it shouldn&#39;t ever be 20 saves/loads... Took 15 to go from &#39;really worn out&#39; to &#39;really energetic&#39;... As far as the cautionary warning, it is something to take under advisement, but so far, raising 4 creatures this way, I haven&#39;t noted any difficulties in the cartridge,or the game... Just a little bit in my thumbs. :&#41;

 I have tried it and it works. The wierd part is that you will get the same message 3-4 times in a row &#40;sorry I didnt write it down&#41; so it seems like it isnt working at first. It may, however be an indicator of sub-levels of fatigue not expressed to us by Holly.

An update here, I tried doing this for several weeks in a row doing just light drills. At the 5th week, I got &#34;Pretty Lively&#34; fairly quickly, but Holly also kept saying that it &#34;seems stressed&#34; right after &#34;lively&#34;. It took 12 resets to get rid of the stress warning. My conclusion is that stress is not relieved as much as fatigue is by doing this. If you are going to use this technique to make a method, make sure you do a few extra resets after getting to &#34;pretty lively&#34; just to make sure you are getting the stress down too. -Or just go all the way to &#34;full of energy&#34;. <BR> <BR>Also note I do not have the more expensive durables yet. Presumably, once I do, the number of re-loads will go down. <BR>

If you re-set enough it makes them not tired at all. If you don&#39;t do it as much, it&#39;s just less tired. <BR> <BR>Note: I got the expensive durables, and there&#39;s a huge difference. Instead of 4-6 re-loads, it now takes 2-3.
