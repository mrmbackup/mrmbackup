 Ok, this is just a small bug, but a bug none the less. It has to do with the hospital. Normally when you go to the hospital, Talt will say &#34;Hello, &#40;enter name here&#41;, what can we do for you today&#34; or &#34;Hello, &#40;enter name here&#41;, Dr. Kohak is here today&#40;that might not be perfect&#41;.     <BR>    <BR>   However, if you go there without a monster Holly will tell you &#34;Oh &#40;name of the last monster you were with&#41;, It&#39;s meaningless to come to the hospital without your monster. Please come back with your monster.&#34;  <BR> <BR>   The only work around: don&#39;t go to the hospital without a monster :p. Effects it has on your game: none, it&#39;s harmless, and depending on the name of you monster can be a good way to get some laughs out of the game.

 The followup to the Hospital Bug: If your monster is tired and you are trying to enter a tournament, Holly says &#34;Oh, &#40;your name&#41;, about &#40;blank&#41;.  It looks as though t is too tired to fight.&#34;

 1: How is that a follow up to the hospital bug? That deals with tournaments. <BR>2: I beleive that that is common knowledge &#40;therefore not a bug, of course if your monster is tired it won&#39;t be able to fight&#91;very well that is, this of course is the reason for all around stat drops in battle&#93;&#41;, BTW, the exact phrase is: &#34;&#40;your name&#41;, about &#40;blank&#41;      It looks pretty exhausted...I doubt it&#39;ll be able to fight as well as usual.&#34;

 While fooling around with the shrine I came up with a password&#40;s&#41; that is completely unusable! Try entering: &#40;blank&#41;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>That blank HAS to be the one to the left of the comma, the stars are just whatever letters you put in. Normally after entering a password it goes to the screen where Bolzoi would say &#34;I will now regenerate your monster.&#34; But because of this he doesn&#39;t say anything and it just goes back to the screen where you would put in passwords. <BR>Work around:Don&#39;t use that blank as your first character in a password.

 That blank is an end-of-word marker.  Where ever you put that blank will end the word at that spot.  For instance if the password is &#34;You Rock&#34; and the you used that blank in between the words, it will be the same as typing in &#34;You&#34;. <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 A Strange bug...  <BR>I have a Grendel who I was raising at the ranch. This bug first occurred when I ran into a stray monster. The Grendel had somewhere around 936 POW &#40;sorry I didn&#39;t write it down, I just think that was what it was&#41;, but when I entered battle, it&#39;s power had dropped into the 800s. It&#39;s Speed also dropped. Everything else was the same. The monster was NOT fatigued, stressed, or sick. I had the expensive things to get rid of such problems, so I know they weren&#39;t present. I also know it was really energetic. Then in the Official C, I had around 966 POW, and it dropped to 866. I had 268 SPD, but it dropped to 241. It&#39;s only traits were Up Claws and Up Magic, so no trait problems. It was also really energetic before that fight. That has never happened before to one of my monsters, but it continued to happen, until I moved POW over 950. Then it stopped. &#40;I remember a battle with a stray when I was 999 and no stats dropped.&#41; Is this a bug? I think it is... a strange one.

 I think, from memory, that stats only drop when you are tired, stressed, sick, slum &#40;Go into a lower tournament&#41; or are already dead.  Otherwise, I do not know.

 There are also stat drops when injured, which can take some time to figure out. Sprains, in particular, occur when training heavily in Pow drills and have the effects described by Mewger. Most likely the drops stopped after you stopped training in Pow as heavily, i.e. when you had time to heal.

 I also want to mention, the stats did not &#34;drop&#34; with the scrolling numbers like they do when you&#39;re tired or something like that. The numbers just were showing up wrong.

 That&#39;s what happens when you are sick, as I recall. <BR> <BR>I maintain you had some illness or injury that cleared up on  <BR>it&#39;s own, unless you had a clean checkup during that  <BR>timeframe.

 I didn&#39;t have a checkup in that time, so you might be right. If it happens again &#40;I can&#39;t use Grendel anymore, it&#39;s a coach&#41; with another monster, I&#39;ll get a checkup and it there&#39;s a sickenss then it won&#39;t be a bug. If there isn&#39;t any sickness &#40;there might be because my monsters are very prone to sprains, with all the heavy training in Pow drills, the normal, the Smash Up, the Tow- and sometimes Sand Bag&#41; then I&#39;ll be back to report that.

 This may not be a bug, but it is interesting. <BR> <BR>I have the Book of Ninja in inventory, but haven&#39;t used it yet. However, last night while testing some passwords up pops my first Zan. That&#39;s right. The book has not been used in combining yet, but Zan is unlocked. <BR> <BR>Strange, huh?

 On the three Training/Invitation monsters &#40;Dragon,  <BR>Durahan, Zan&#41;, the permission comes when you win the  <BR>tournament, not when you use the item. For others,  <BR>&#40;Henger, Joker, etc.&#41; using the item is required.
