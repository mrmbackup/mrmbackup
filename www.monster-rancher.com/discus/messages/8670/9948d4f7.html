 In the unlocking instructions, #4 says that you must raise the children of 1/2 and 4/5, to A class. I only raised one of those children to A class, combined it with the other to get Arrowhead 7, and then combined it with my Archreaper&#40;master class&#41;, Serket was an option. In other words, I don&#39;t think that you have to raise the children.

 The funkiest thing about the thoroughbreds is that they aren&#39;t consistent.  For instance, with the Whitehound, you can use a no-name-brand Gali to combine.  But, with the Serket, you need a Class A Joker to combine.  It may be that because the joker needs to be class A, the Arrowheads do not.  Just look at the Devi.  You need a thoroughbred Mocchi and a thoroughbred Zan, but neither have to be of any rank. <BR> <BR>  So the real name of the game here is that you can&#39;t be sure what the requirements are until you you try it many different ways. <BR> <BR>  Here are the things I know for SURE: <BR> <BR>Whitehound:  All tigers MUST be class A.  When I tested this out, I found that having 1 bad tiger forced me to start over. <BR> <BR>Serket:  The Joker MUST be Class A or better.  When I created my Thoroughbred arrowhead, and tried to combine with the joker, it didn&#39;t happen.  I raised the joker and tried every rank until it worked. <BR> <BR>  When you made the Serket, was it the first time?  If it wasn&#39;t your first, then you could combine any arrowhead with a joker to get it. <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 It was my first time, I had gotten really impatient and hadn&#39;t played for awhile and decided to try and get it without training. To my surprise Serket was an option...looks really cool too...

 Did you make them thoroughbreds &#40;note: this is different than pure bred&#41; ? as the instructions say, you need a 3rd gen zan and a 3rd gen mocchi.

 um...when you say it doesn&#39;t need to be A clas for the arrowhead, just the arrowhead 6 and 7 dont have to be, or none of them? this may sound stupid, but it could save alot of time.

 I already had raised Arrowheads 1/2-&#62;3 and 4/5, not 6 or 7, so it may very well be all, or just 3,6 and 7&#40;I am no longer in a position to test any of this&#41;, but for sure you do not have to raise the 6th or 7th arrowheads which is all I have confirmed. Someone else should try see if you have to raise any arrowheads or just 1/2 and 4/5, or if you even have raise 3.

 the next test, for anyone with lots of open studio storage, and willing to , since i have almost no studio storage, with a baby 2nd gen gali, an active angel, bushi-do, and pickle, and a Chaos head working on the emperor cup, and a old mew in waiting for combining, it would nice if someone could do it. That would be, try the mocchi zan legend with all babies. you would need four open spaces to do it, three to get the thourogh bred mochi, that fills up one permantly untill combining, then the remaining three to do the zan, then combine.

 Done.  You can pull off Devi with E-ranked monsters.  All you have to wait for is to unlock Zan so you can use it
