 No Cinder Bird, but I have confirmed Blaze. <BR>I got a random attack from a blue phoenix named  <BR>Phill &#40;like the groundhog Phil&#41;.

 I was hoping to get attacked by the blue Phoenix stray while I was waiting on the Emperor&#39;s cup last night but it didn&#39;t happen and I won the emperor&#39;s cup...do you think it might still attack after I&#39;ve beaten Dynast..?  <BR>my Phoenix is 3yrs 8 mos. so I don&#39;t know how much longer I will have him.... <BR> <BR>-Chris

 I&#39;m sure it will still attack whether Emperor&#39;s has been beaten or not. I am of the opinion that Master class is master class &#40;the little crown icon you get after S official&#41; as far as the monster is concerned.  I heartily recommend the reload procedure. <BR> <BR>Also to hearten you, my phoenix lived to 5yr, but I was quite good to him. Also there is fairly conclusive evidence that any monster at Master rank can get attacked by Blaze.

Stat hits for being tired: <BR> <BR>A little tired: 6%  with no ACC hit <BR>Tired: 12% with a 6% ACC hit <BR> <BR>All stats take a hit, ACC less than the others. <BR>On Second thought I think part of the ACC hit is mitigated by my Eagle Eye trait. <BR> <BR>I have yet to experiment with the more extreme ranges of tiredness.

 still no luck for me to be attacked by the blue stray,Phil.... <BR>I had my Doodle in master rank for just about 8 months and no attack b-4 I had to stop using him...but now that I think about it, he wont gain stats or be able to battle but he can still get attacked and battle a stray....so maybe I&#39;ll leave him out for a little while longer... <BR>or I&#39;ll just switch back to my Phoenix... <BR>thats an interesting fact about the Ragnarock though...

 Are you positive you can still get attacked? I have yet to manage getting attacked after the final warning. <BR> <BR>I heartily recommend reloading to get the right attack. It saves your time too because it keeps the monster in the proper state &#40;tired&#41; and in the proper months. <BR> <BR>Spring may be better than summer, or it may be that each breed has a season in which it gets attacked more. More on this if I can verify it.

 yes....it happened to me when I was trying to unlock Ragnarock with the Angel Pixie.... <BR>I had gotten the final msg and I decided to leave it out because I was close to the time when he should attack and had fought another stray with a monster that had just gotten the &#34;retire&#34; msg. <BR>and sure enough Ragnarock attacked and I beat him with the Pixie...&#40;I had to reload once &#39;cause I lost the 1st try&#41;but I will try the reloading thing tonight..I was playing around a bit with it last night... <BR>maybe the breed dose have something to do with the season &#39;cause it was from march to Oct.,I think, that I had Doodle out...and nothing happened...

 I have a new theory. The only thing it replaces from what I said earlier is the summertime idea. <BR> <BR>I think a monster has an attack counter. The longer you go without a stray fight, the higher the chance for it. I am deliberately reloading if I get attacked and I now get attacked almost every week regardless of tiredness. <BR> <BR>So now my advice to get attacked changes a little. <BR>Reload if you get attacked and proceed s few more months. When the frequency of attacks goes up more, get tired save and reload.  I&#39;m in master class and the monster has yet to get hit by any rares, so I dtill think my 1rare/rank holds true.

I don&#39;t think this will work for any other rank than Class A but I could be wrong. <BR> <BR>This also strengthens my suspicion that some of the Attacking monsters depend on the breed you are raising. xswzaq could very well have been correct about Cinder Bird.

Ok here&#39;s a real, reasoned, experiment with some decent results. Hopefully it will be helpful, and make some sort of sense. <BR> <BR><B>Theory</B> There is a hidden Attack Counter in the game. The longer your monster goes without a random attack, the higher it&#39;s chances to get attacked. This was a test to verify its existence, and begin to determine, in a rough way, how much it increments each week. <BR> <BR><B>The Test</B> I used a monster that had developed a fairly high chance to get attacked &#40;Class S Ragnaroks&#41;. In an attempt to get FeaterGold I had avoided attacks &#40;see Notes&#41; to a point where I could barely proceed without getting attacked. Here are the steps I took, and the results are in a table below: <BR>1&#41; The Dragon was fully rested, and I reloaded 101 times and marked the results. On the 101st reload I fought the battle and defeated the Stray. <BR>2&#41; I trained, then saved, then used the Overload trick &#40;nevertired method&#41; 4 times to get the dragon back to energetic. <BR>3&#41; Then I reloaded 100 times and marked the results. <BR>4&#41; Then I proceeded with a normal training schedule for 37 weeks. I avoided one attack that came after about 4 months. This was an arbitrary amount of time, basically I stopped when I had maxed DEF and LIF. <BR>5&#41; Lastly I reloaded 100 times and marked the results. <BR> <BR><B>Results</B> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Week</TD><TD>Attack</TD><TD>No Attack</TD><TD>% </TD></TR><TR><TD>-1</TD><TD>60</TD><TD>41</TD><TD>60 </TD></TR><TR><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>100</TD><TD>0 </TD></TR><TR><TD>37</TD><TD>24</TD><TD>76</TD><TD>24 </TD></TR><TR><TD></TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>% chance increase per week= .65% <BR> <BR><B>Notes and Flaws</B> <BR> <BR>1&#41;this probably isn&#39;t enough reloads to be statistically valid. Also I will proceed another few months untill I reach one year, and test again to see if the number holds up. <BR> <BR>2&#41; the biggest flaw, one I just realized, is that week -1 and week 0 were in the same month. I seriously doubt the game allows for 2 attacks in the same month. If I test this again I will either do it on week4 then week1 of the next month, or wait one full calendar month. <BR> <BR>3&#41; avoiding attacks- by this I mean if I was attacked I simply reloaded from my most recent save, never more than 3 weeks. <BR> <BR>4&#41; There are certain factors that add to your chances. Like Tiredness, or certain weeks &#40;like week 1 or Tournament weeks&#41;. If I can come up with a way to test these additions I will. I already have a test planned to check tiredness. <BR> <BR>5&#41; I have no idea if the Attack counter varies by breed. I will try my test again someday, with a different monster. <BR> <BR>6&#41; what it all boils down to: This is of use when you are seeking a Rare Attacker. The longer you wait the better your shot. For the  Attackers that become available in Class A I found that taking the first fight in Class D, then training and advancing as quickly as possible timed itself out well. I ended up hitting Class A with and Attack chance of 50% and thats really as much as you need. Once you get to Class A with a chance like that it often takes only a few reloads to get the monster you seek.

 I never managed to get attacked by Featergold in any rank above A. I have begun a search of all ruins, but I&#39;ve done this before. I now its simply a password we haven&#39;t found yet. Nothing to say pitbocor isn&#39;t an attacker though, I plan to raise a Joker soon.

 I can&#39;t make any comments about the special wild monsters, but I can confirm the &#39;monster counter&#39;. I had a monster in E-class for over a year, getting stats. When I finally moved it to D-class, I had 6 monster fights in the first week &#40;reloaded every loss, and each time I finished the E-class battle, I came into another monster attack&#41;. Then, the first week I didn&#39;t, I had one in the second week that I actually managed to defeat.

 It has been reported that attacks occur even after retirement, but I haven&#39;t confirmed it myself. I think you are in a a good position to test for us, especially if you follow the instructions I laid out here for increasing your chances.

 BTW, if you need a Phoenix to unlock Blaze, can you use a Cinder Bird?

 Look at step three in the notes section above, Dmonsters. <BR> <BR>1&#41; Play for a while if you get attacked. <BR>2&#41; Give up the battle then reload. <BR>3&#41; Continue training or sleeping. <BR>4&#41; Repeat this until it is almost impossible to go further without getting attacked. <BR> <BR>When the attacks come on almost every reload, simply reload until you get attacked by the monster you want.
