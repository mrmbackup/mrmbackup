Since people seem to have trouble parsing this info out of  <BR>the thread we already have devoted to the topic, here is the  <BR>definitve staus report on the final monster in MRA2 that we  <BR>have yet to successfully unlock. <BR> <BR>#240 Octochrome &#40;Sp-U&#41; <BR> <BR>Octochrome is an attack rare &#40;see other threads for what  <BR>that means&#41;. If you raise an Octopee you have a chance to  <BR>get attacked by Gorkin. When you beat him, you get the  <BR>password MAC_OCT when you use it at the Shrine, it gives  <BR>you a special Ducken named Brinjalon. <FONT COLOR="ff0000">thanks to  <BR>Kurasu for uncovering this</FONT> This is a monster that normally  <BR>has no unlocking requirements. The conclusion is that the  <BR>password is defective, and points to the wrong memory  <BR>register. <BR> <BR>Lisa has asked Brian at Tecmo about it, and he has passed  <BR>the request on to Japan. Don&#39;t ask whether she&#39;s heard  <BR>back yet, I seriously doubt Lisa will forget to mention it if  <BR>she does hear. <BR> <BR>People have made several alternate suggestions without  <BR>verifying them on their own. I&#39;m not alone among MRM  <BR>mods in not wanting to hear about them any more. If you  <BR>have an idea, try it. If it doesn&#39;t work then post it and tell us  <BR>that, but don&#39;t create work for other people, that&#39;s not the  <BR>way MRM works. <BR> <BR>The only remaining possibility as I see it is this: There may  <BR>be more than one password for the attack rares. It is  <BR>possible but unlikely that someone who has gotten the  <BR>Gorkin Event could use a password to successfully generate  <BR>an Octochrome. However, the possibility is slim to none. No  <BR>other attack rares have a second password. This route of  <BR>research would be simple, boring, password crunching.  <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;Off Topic&#42; <BR>On a personal note, I am sad that I have gotten so close to  <BR>earning a full collection of 511 out of 512 monsters, but  <BR>won&#39;t be able to finish seemingly. However I am more than  <BR>satisfied with the work I have done one research for this  <BR>game, and am not particularly gung-ho about doing work  <BR>on one last monster. I deliberately eased off when we got  <BR>the majority of monsters, since I wanted to leave something  <BR>for other people to do. <BR> <BR>This kinda sounds like some odd goodbye post huh? It&#39;s  <BR>not I assure you. I&#39;ve got cleanup in this section when I get  <BR>around to it, and there is still plenty of things to write up  <BR>about MRA2. I&#39;d like to see a nice comprehensive post on  <BR>exploration, and I swear I&#39;ll finish updating those maps  <BR>someday.

 How do you find this Torridon and has anyone found out the password.  My hands hurt from trying so many passwords. :&#41;

 Huh. The attack-rare with a second password is a ducken. And our unlockable Octochrome also becomes a ducken. Could there be some relation? Anyone else find a password that &#39;mutates&#39; into a ducken into an odd way? Or that _doesn&#39;t_ mutate normally into a ducken where it probably should? <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t mind me. My brain just works in odd and mysterious ways.

 I think, in this case, that it&#39;s actually Lisa who&#39;s wrong. <BR> <BR>MAC_OCT does appear... MAX_OCT doesn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>So who knows. <BR> <BR>Then again, I don&#39;t even have the game, so I&#39;ll butt out about now...

 I misread it. However, I do know that MAX_OCT was one of the first of literally thousands of passwords we tried while looking for it.

 Notice this... <BR>The C and X are right next to each other on the American keyboard... <BR>And go directly to the Hospital after trying to regenerate it...it may say octochrome...I&#39;ll try it, and report back...

 MAX_OCT was tested as a Rabbiroller. I don&#39;t recall which tread it was in, but I thought it was the first one about Octochrome.

 Maybe the defect is in the Password interpreter. <BR> <BR>I personally suspect that the &#34;special&#34; passwords you get in the game don&#39;t enter into the Monster Generator the same way the others do. <BR> <BR>I think that instead the game checks to see if it&#39;s a pre-formed password and then uses the data for the preformed monster instead of the normal generation method.

 Err... forgot the last thing. I think that they didn&#39;t put that password in the &#34;special&#34; list. since I&#39;ve never done the OctoChrome event but I got a Brinjalon with &#34;MAC_OCT&#34; anyways. Also I have done the event that gives you the &#34;Sun_Bath&#34; Password. <BR> <BR>So apparently the password is defective. :p It should be possible to get a different password for it though. But you&#39;ll have to use the event to be able to regenerate.

 Okay I did some more research into the Pre-Set passwords. It appears that the game has a special memory area where it stores the monster data for them. I.E. they don&#39;t go into the generator like the other ones. The thing I noticed recently was that it stores ALL the data. Stats, traits, etc.. I think the error with this one is that the stored data has the wrong Family value which, in this case, results in a monster in the ducken family. So in conclusion, Mac_Oct IS a pre-set password, as far as monster generation is concerned, but the programmers screwed up and accidentally programmed in Brinjallon instead of OctoChrome.

I+misread+it%2e+However%2c+I+do+know+that+MAX_OCT+was+one+of+the+first+of+literally+thousands+of+passwords+we+tried+while+looking+for+it%2e

MAX_OCT+was+tested+as+a+Rabbiroller%2e+I+don%27t+recall+which+tread+it+was+in%2c+but+I+thought+it+was+the+first+one+about+Octochrome%2e

Maybe+the+defect+is+in+the+Password+interpreter%2e%0a%0aI+personally+suspect+that+the+%26quot%3bspecial%26quot%3b+passwords+you+get+in+the+game+don%27t+enter+into+the+Monster+Generator+the+same+way+the+others+do%2e%0a%0aI+think+that+instead+the+game+checks+to+see+if+it%27s+a+pre%2dformed+password+and+then+uses+the+data+for+the+preformed+monster+instead+of+the+normal+generation+method%2e
<!-/Source: 76713-!>
<!-Source: 76714-!>
Err%2e%2e%2e+forgot+the+last+thing%2e+I+think+that+they+didn%27t+put+that+password+in+the+%26quot%3bspecial%26quot%3b+list%2e+since+I%27ve+never+done+the+OctoChrome+event+but+I+got+a+Brinjalon+with+%26quot%3bMAC_OCT%26quot%3b+anyways%2e+Also+I+have+done+the+event+that+gives+you+the+%26quot%3bSun_Bath%26quot%3b+Password%2e%0a%0aSo+apparently+the+password+is+defective%2e+%3ap+It+should+be+possible+to+get+a+different+password+for+it+though%2e+But+you%27ll+have+to+use+the+event+to+be+able+to+regenerate%2e

Okay+I+did+some+more+research+into+the+Pre%2dSet+passwords%2e+It+appears+that+the+game+has+a+special+memory+area+where+it+stores+the+monster+data+for+them%2e+I%2eE%2e+they+don%27t+go+into+the+generator+like+the+other+ones%2e+The+thing+I+noticed+recently+was+that+it+stores+ALL+the+data%2e+Stats%2c+traits%2c+etc%2e%2e+I+think+the+error+with+this+one+is+that+the+stored+data+has+the+wrong+Family+value+which%2c+in+this+case%2c+results+in+a+monster+in+the+ducken+family%2e+So+in+conclusion%2c+Mac_Oct+IS+a+pre%2dset+password%2c+as+far+as+monster+generation+is+concerned%2c+but+the+programmers+screwed+up+and+accidentally+programmed+in+Brinjallon+instead+of+OctoChrome%2e
