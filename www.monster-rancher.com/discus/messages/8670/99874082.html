 My SO had a trainer that just wasn&#39;t doing it for him. So he raised a Torridon to take over for said trainer &#40;speed/skill/intelligence drills&#41;. When he finished up said Torridon, his trainer had just gotten the &#39;retire next month&#39; warning, so he went ahead and put the torridon into place. <BR> <BR>A while after, around several game years, I was doing experiments with his trainers to see what they were listed as &#39;good&#39; in. For his Torridon, I went to &#39;take off&#39;, so I could re-add it. Imagine my surprise when, as soon as the torridon was taken off and I went to reassign it, his old trainer had showed up in that position again. It did this in three completely different slots. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been able to duplicate this effect with my &#39;locked&#39; trainer, Morgan, but no other trainers at all. It looks like when trainers lock into place, they lock into place whether you were going to replace them or not.

 This is very similar to the permacoach bug. They both have to do with the game&#39;s flaws in clearing the memory registers. The more we learn, the less I think there is going to be any way to consistently reproduce the Coach effect. I till modify the Coach bug to reflect this aspect of it though. Good detective work!

 Happened. That one Raiden coach is still there, and I did not even pay him once. <BR> <BR>I got him early, and had him for 50 years... <BR> <BR>However, there is a note...for some reason, the traits did not pass along...

 By the way, another note for this that I&#39;ve just learned: if you replace the perma-coach with something else, and let that &#39;something else&#39; leave in the natural way, the windows seem to clear up. I lost Perma-Morgan this way. Blah! <BR> <BR>And I had the same problem as Moonmonster: once Morgan was a perma-coach, getting her traits to pass were all but impossible. I didn&#39;t get CHarisma even once, and it usually spreads like a plague.

 Hmmm... This seems to be a memory issue. So it could be that the &#34;perma-coach&#34; doesn&#39;t retain all of the data that the original coach had.
