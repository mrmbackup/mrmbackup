It will Now mention the H G R R S H &#40;Henger research&#41; Lab. It will also have a map.  <BR>4&#41; Go to the ice crevice at north of the ruins. Once you have the map from the monument, you will find an Ice bridge across the gap.  <BR>5&#41; Cross the gap, break the rock, search the temple at the end of the path. It will contain the Gali Mask.  <BR> <BR><B>Garu:</B> Available from the start. <BR> <BR><B>Gitan:</B> Gitan can be made by winning an A-Class tourney that gives you an item called &#34;black spear&#34;.

Chamois will take this part also. She will hold on to them while she does research.  <BR>5&#41; A short while after you return from your expedition &#40;about 2 months or so&#41; Chamois will come to the Ranch saying she put the parts together. the Item is incomplete, though.  <BR>6&#41; Go back to Malkt and find the Head, which is in the NE corner of the map.  <BR>7&#41; Return to the Studio. Chamois will put the Henger together and give you an item called Mech Bot.  <BR>8&#41; Use the Mech Bot as a combining item and you will receive a Henger.  <BR> <BR><B>Joker:</B> You must be at rank A on Jan 1 for the initial event to occur. Your monster needs 200 minimum in every stat, and Pow or Int over 600. On the first week of January, Mr. Mardoc will ask you to hunt down the Joker that ran away from its owner in Tapota. When exploring Tapota, Look for the wild Joker, and defeat it. When you explore the buildings/sites, Holly and Karnab will say whether or not its there. If you defeat it, Mr. Mardoc will give you the Joker Mask that can be used in the Studio. Just mix two monsters with the mask, and you&#39;ll have a Joker.  <BR> <BR>The Joker fight&#39;s kinda tough &#40;It has almost 600&#43; in every stat.&#41; If you lose this battle, you may enter again next year. <BR> <BR><B>Lesione:</B> Requires the medium stable stable, so have Bint upgrade your stable in the Town Square. <BR> <BR><B>Mew:</B> Available from the start. <BR> <BR><B>Mocchi:</B> Available from the start. <BR> <BR><B>Mogi:</B> Available from the start. <BR> <BR><B>Momo:</B> Available from the start. <BR> <BR><B>Monol:</B> There is a Quarry in the NW corner of the Tapota Ruins. You must visit it at least once before the you can get the little Monolith from the the North Temple. Once you have visited, you can visit the temple that is in the center North area of the map. You should get it on the first try after visiting the Quarry. &#40;My Monster had 200 Int, so it obviously is a set event. -Thorr&#41; <BR> <BR>In Tapota find the big pile of huge monoliths &#40;this is the Quarry&#41;, and and look around for a very large building around that spot &#40;It should have a flap top too&#41;. Your monster should find a small monolith, and once you find it, you&#39;ll immediately go back to your ranch. Bolzoi will stop by, and be amazed with the small monolith. He&#39;ll let you use it so you can make a pure monol.  <BR> <BR><B>Naga:</B> Requires the medium stable stable, so have Bint upgrade your stable in the Town Square. <BR> <BR><B>Octopee:</B> Available from the start. <BR> <BR><B>Phoenix:</B> <BR>Note: You must unlock Dragon, Durahan, Joker, Zan, Gali, Henger, and Monol before Step 3 will occur.

Take the item and use in the Studio while combining two monsters. &#40;Babies fresh from the shrine work just fine.&#41;  <BR>Note: If for some reason you need to do other things first, the guy will stay in the square for one month after you first trigger him.
