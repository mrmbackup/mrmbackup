 ...I finally have permission to go to a place called Tapota when I want to explore stuff.  You get it through a variety of scenarios after you hit D class.  First, you&#39;ll meet a free lance trainer whose monster &#40;a Golem&#41; was hurt.  Holly will let him rest, and as a reward, you can make his Golem a coach &#40;Use him for flip&#41;. <BR> <BR>Then you&#39;ll probably meet your second rival named hunter, and this time the fight is optional &#40;I defeated him with my Raiden&#41;.  Finally, after the Hunter incident, you&#39;ll see Mr. Karnab from FIMBA &#40;Karn in MR1&#41; who will tell you that he got permission from AGIMA to explore Tapota. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if you have to be a certain rank to go on expeditions so I am going to have to check it out when I make another monster &#40;My Raiden&#39;s too dumb for trips.  He&#39;s meant for fighting&#41;. <BR> <BR>As for the rest, it seems that you can develop traits with the coaches while you can also get traits in certain conditions.  When I trained with the Mocchi Holly brought along for the first few tries, my Raiden and Mogi both developed UpMind.  The Golem I just mentioned gae my Raiden the UPEarth trait, and due to the eight million E-Class battles my Raiden went through or his popularity, he also developed a trait called &#34;Popularity&#34;. <BR> <BR>I just thought you might be interested in knowing about expeditions and traits.

 pt. 2 &#40;Just a brief update&#41; <BR> <BR>I just got another place to explore.  It&#39;s in a snowy rrgion called Malkt, a place that is supposed to be forbidden for trainers.  You have to be at least a level 2 breeder to get it, and Karnab &#40;Karn&#41; will ask you to help him  go there because Mr. Mardoc won&#39;t let him or anyone else fo there.  Being the inquisitive person, Karn forces you to go anyway, but when you go there, you&#39;ll be attacked by a robber.  Defeat him, and you&#39;ll return to the ranch. <BR> <BR>To go there at anytime, you have to be a level 3 trainer, and have a B-ranked monster, or a monster with a rank higher than B. <BR> <BR>I forgot to mention that according to the booklet, it says that &#34;accidents&#34; can happen while you right random monsters in expeditions.  I hope it doesn&#39;t mean that they get lost like they did in MR1. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a neat feature in mra2 called soulmates where monsters your pet can cooperate with can help it in battle sometimes.  They do different things from healing to skill boosts, but from what I heard from Aroma, they only work in official battles. <BR> <BR>  Aroma seems to be the only person you can make as a soul mate &#40;maybe you can do it with other rivals, but I am not sure&#41;.  I&#39;d try it through the GBA link, but I am not going to buy another GBA and another MRA2.  Most of the people I hang out with don&#39;t play MR, and I am not that hardcore. <BR> <BR>Strays are also in MRA2.  I just fought one with my C-Class Raiden.

 Sorry these responses came late: <BR> <BR>Chris <BR>Amity cups are supposed to be in the following: FIMBA Amity Cup &#40;Feb. 1st week&#41;, and then AGIMA &#40;Augts 3rd week&#41;,  The only A class fight that&#39;s in March is The Dynamite cup, and that&#39;s a Tribe only match.  I think you missed it, but it should always show up a month before they occur &#40;e.g. first week of January for the FIMBA&#41;.  I think you also have to pass the FIMBA Amity Cup first before you can get to the other cup. <BR> <BR>  Oh yeah, I think I already covered the idea that monsters get lost in expeditions earlier yesterday, but if I didn&#39;t, thanks for letting me know while confirming it for me. O appreciate it :0&#41; <BR> <BR>This special training &#34;issue&#34; is kinda odd because my Suzurins never had problems getting into them.  Maybe you have to go to the FIMBA amity in February first, then hit the IMA amity cup. <BR> <BR>&#34;Training&#34; has something to do with the plot.  Someone failed to raise a Joker after winning an invite, and now AGIMA is forcing trainers to earn the invitation matches by finding proof that monsters like Durahan exist.  &#34;Training&#34; can be found when you go to the AGIMA section when you hit the town.  <BR> <BR> They send you to a place like Tapota or Malkt to find &#34;proof&#34;.  It&#39;s just an expedition that ends when you find the items AGIMA asks for.  Once you find &#34;proof&#34; regarding the monster they might let you raise, you&#39;ll get an invite from Bolzoi a month before the match begins. <BR> <BR>Inqquitious: <BR>  It&#39;s kinda tough for me to describe the Warrior/Durahan statue in Tapota, but I&#39;ll give it my best shot.  It should be around the area where there are a group of pillars that have three obstacles that need to be smashed.  Once you past the obstacles, look around the southern-western part of that area.  You should see a silver statue of a Durahan, and hopefully you&#39;ll find the proof to get Duraha, Dragon, or Zan &#40;Joker&#39;s different&#41;. <BR> <BR>I hoped I helped both of you.

 does getting the proof of the warrior and having it allow you to enter the tourny even if you had to make a new monster &#40;had to retire the one that found it in the first place&#41;.

 Once you get the Proof you should also get an  <BR>Invite W. This should still be good for a new  <BR>monster. Just raise him to class A and be at home  <BR>from Nov1-Nov2

 speaking of UP MIND I noticed something.  If your monster is training with another monster &#40;such as the moochi&#41; if you look at thier traits list you can find what they have.  After awhile you monster will have some of one of the traits &#34;rub off&#34; onto your monster &#40;I.E. Training a Golem in intellegence and using a Suezo teacher will get the golem to acquire Eagle Eye &#40;not guaranteed though&#41;. Just one of my many thoughts.

 Not only with other coaches, my Tiger developed &#40;and lost&#41; Glutton while training and also after a good amount of Intelligence training &#40;Meditate&#41; I got Up IQ. And Popular when my Fame got near 100.

 I&#39;ve been working with characteristics a lot and  <BR>they seem to fall into 4 categories. <BR> <BR>Earned- Get them from fighting e.g. Dignity and  <BR>Popular <BR> <BR>Learned- Learned from a coach. Can be most  <BR>anything, have yet to see how well Charisma  <BR>improves transfers. <BR> <BR>Metabolic- Gained based on how you train the  <BR>monster. Glutton happens to most babies, also  <BR>Listless can crop up. <BR> <BR>Potential- Come from training the monster in  <BR>certain drills Up IQ is most common.

 My Garu/SP had 100 fame for over a year before it developed the Popular trait.  And I have also had many other garu&#39;s  with 100 fame that never got this trait.

 Popularity doesn&#39;t spring up when you get to 100.  It just helps you to get there faster.  Popularity will most likely pop up if you win your first official tournament in a short amount of time.  With 3 of my monsters, I won the Class E official in 2 months.  All of them got a 30&#43; point popularity increase and they acquired the Popular trait.  It&#39;s still kinda worthless, though. <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 The development of popular also seems to have  <BR>something to do with how well you do in fights,  <BR>and possibly the breed &#40;ahhh those fickle fans&#41;. <BR> <BR>I get popular all the time no matter what breed I  <BR>raise, it&#39;s like fleas. This is because I tend to  <BR>seriously overmatch my competition before I  <BR>fight. In fact I do my best to fill up my traits  <BR>so I don&#39;t have to deal with popular. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately this prevents me from learning more  <BR>about getting good earned traits like dignity.

 OK, I know that you have to beat the Emperor&#39;s Cup to get into Promiass, but how do I get into the Emporer&#39;s Cup? I checked the calender on this site and it said that the Emperor&#39;s Cup takes Place July-1&#39;st week. I have a monster that is the highest class and has beaten the great four, but the July Calender is blank on my game. Can anyone tell me how to get into the Emperor&#39;s Cup, or at least what week it&#39;s REALLY on if it&#39;s not the 1&#39;st week in July.

 You need to get the invitation June 1, then it will show up on your calendar.  And be sure your monster has done all of the great 4 himself. <BR> <BR>-Thorr
