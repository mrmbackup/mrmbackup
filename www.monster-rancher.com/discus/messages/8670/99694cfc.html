The section mentions that it has taken longer for some people to get the suezo orb. I just wanted to confirm that it took me a couple months to get mine. I got it with the first suezo, but it wasn&#39;t within two or three weeks. Just FYI. <BR> <BR>Also, my hare didn&#39;t immediately get thrown into the anti-hare battle. I had a week&#39;s worth of rest before he was forced into going once, and two weeks a second time &#40;when the first failed&#41;. I think it might have something to do with that &#39;random encounter counter&#39;, although I&#39;m not positive.

 I would have to also agree that it takes longer than two or three weeks.  My Suezo is 5 months old and still no orb.  I gave up on it and went on to a hare. <BR> <BR>My hare rested a week after the tourney before I got to battle the stray.

 Well, it happened that way for you.  For me, I made a suezo, rested him once, then he immediately gave me the orb.  The very same thing happened for GoldenBoy. <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 I have tested this many times, and found out this simple fact: your Suezo gives you the orb on the 1st week of January

 I thawed my suezo out for one more try at the orb and the second week after resting, I got the orb.  I had to be around January that I got it...I didnt note the exact date.  But it is May in the game and I started raising a golem right after I got the orb and it is 5 months old.

 I didn&#39;t say that&#39;s how it worked for everyone, Thorr. Just that for some people, it&#39;s not going to work in the first or second week, like you suggest. <BR> <BR>As for mine, I don&#39;t recall when I got it. Just that I got it after a while. A couple months.

 Addendum:  I got my Suezo Orb 3 weeks after I got the Hare Orb.  Ergo: I got my Suezo Orb in March.  Sorry, January boy, but your &#34;simple fact&#34; is not a fact at all. <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 I got my Suezo Orb in three weeks. The first week, I drilled my Suezo, punishing for a failure. Next week, I saved, and reloaded. When I reloaded, I got the Suezo Orb. I guess this means that if you&#39;re willing to save and reload enough, you can get it during the course of one &#34;week&#34;.

 Funny, every single time I got the Suezo Orb, it was on the 1st of January.  Maybe it has something to do with either the type of Suezo &#40;mine was pure&#41; or when you made it.  Thorr and Infernus, what type of sub-breed of Suezo did you have?  When did you shrine it?

 Mine was a Metal Sue, I shrined it anywhere between July 3rd week, and June 1st week as he was 2 weeks old when he gave it to me, and as I said before, I don&#39;t remember what week he gave it to me, but I think it was the third &#40;I also know it wasn&#39;t the fourth&#41;

 I used a Noctovis, one of the Special Suezos, the only one I had in my book.

 It took me nine &#40;9&#41; months before my Suezo &#40;a Noctovis, like MSL99&#39;s&#41; found the orb. He was E class, and not particularly loyal. He had Eagle Eyes and Satori for what it&#39;s worth.  <BR> <BR>Possibly non-coincidentally, he found it exactly on January 1. So I think the January thing is a connection. Perhaps those who got the orb post-January had some special ability in their suezo which permitted them to find it sooner.  <BR> <BR>I did quit and reload the game and again I found the orb on Jan 1.

 It may be a stat thing.  Perhaps the Metal Sue I used had just enough Int or whatever to find it right away.  He was the only suezo I ever created. <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 Negative.  I used a pure Suezo, then a corrupted one &#40;one who I used Max stats with Gameshark on&#41;, and both coughed up the Orb on the same date.  Also, I shrined it the week right before the new year.  I&#39;m going to try whether monster rank, traits, or items change the day.

I&#39;ve tried every monster in the Suezo family, all gave me the orb a week after it was Shrined because I rested that week. <BR> <BR>This leads me to suspect that a Suezo needs to have 0 stress and 0 fatigue to <I>increase</I> the chances of the Orb appearing.

 I got the Suezo Orb by Resting my Noctovis immediately after getting it from the shrine.

 I shined a Suezo for the sole purpose of getting an Orb, but it didn&#39;t find one in the first 3 months, so I gave up. Later &#40;sorry for the lack of information&#41;, I shrined another Suezo, and it found one in a week. I will note that I did rest that week, and that they were both pure Suezo&#39;s.

 The reason people are seeing a difference in how long it takes to obtain the suezo orb is that no orb &#40;other then flare of course&#41; can be obtained until the Jan 1st following winning the Emperor&#39;s Cup where Mentor Teska will come to say Happy New Year.
