 My SO and I introduced a pair of monsters. In the introduction, they became best friends, and I gained a smash attack out of the deal. I distinctly remember when I got it that it was a B/B/D/D, and cost 38 to throw. <BR> <BR>Later on in the game, after some time, training, and two other unsuccessful introductions, I found that my 38 cost attack was suddenly costing 42. When I checked its stats, it was an S/B/D/D.  <BR> <BR>Anyone else notice this happening to them? I know what I saw. This wasn&#39;t a wild hallucination that the attack cost 38. I have eyewitness report from the SO, when I showed him the move. I also have the same report with the attack as it is now, with its much-raised hit.

 And again. Different monster, different tech, same thing. It spontaneously changed in cost. This time, the healing went from an S/E/E/E for 35, to an S/E/E/E for 30. This time, the only difference is that the monster was being fought heavily. No extra monsters brought in as buddies to explain this one.

 I believe you.  I had a monster become soulmates with another at the very begining of its life &#40;right out of the shrine&#41;.  As it grew so did its soulmate move.  This could nicely explain some of the discrepancies in soulmate moves. <BR> <BR>If I ever get around to getting some of the pure breed rares it&#39;ll provide some good documentation.

 Recieved XXX Block after becoming best friends with a Suzurin.  The soulmate atempt was made when both monsters were fresh from the shrine.  I used the move at least once in every battle I participated in but only rank changes affected the moves stats. <BR> <BR>At Rank E <BR>XXX Block, Int, B E E D 20 <BR>At Rank C <BR>XXX Block, Int, B E E D 24 <BR>At Rank B <BR>XXX Block, Int, B E E D 24 <BR>At Rank A <BR>XXX Block, Int, B E E D 28 <BR> <BR>Hopefully the next move I get will not be a block.  The block move doesn&#39;t vary as much as a Smash could. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently working on expedition research so I&#39;m posting this info as may be a while before I get back to it.

 When you get back to it, Seize, try it with a &#39;Smash&#39; move. I&#39;ve never seen block&#39;s stats change around much, but smash has been everything from B/B/D/E to S/S/D/D from what I&#39;ve heard.  <BR> <BR>My link cable has temporarily gone AWOL &#40;I think the SO accidently took it to work&#41; or I&#39;d give it a shot myself. I should be able to by Monday or Tuesday, though.

 &#34;Other Soulmate Moves&#34; and &#34;Interesting Happenings with Buddy Moves&#34; seem to be running parallel.  Anyone interested in one should be sure to check any progress found under the other name.

Drat! I thought I was on to something. <BR>I got a best friend before ever entering the monster in an official battle.  Then watched to see if the move&#39;s stats change as the monster advances in rank. <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>X Smash</TD><TD></TD><TD>&#40;Power type&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Rank E</TD><TD></TD><TD>Rank D</TD><TD></TD><TD>Rank C</TD><TD></TD><TD>Rank B</TD><TD></TD><TD>Rank B</TD><TD></TD><TD>Rank A </TD></TR><TR><TD>B C<br>E D</TD><TD></TD><TD>B C<br>E D</TD><TD></TD><TD>B B<br>D D</TD><TD></TD><TD>B B<br>D D</TD><TD></TD><TD>B B<br>D D</TD><TD></TD><TD>B B<br>D D </TD></TR><TR><TD>36</TD><TD></TD><TD>36</TD><TD></TD><TD>39</TD><TD></TD><TD>39</TD><TD></TD><TD>42</TD><TD></TD><TD>42 </TD></TR><TR><TD></TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>...But as you can see the move&#39;s stats changed between monster ranks B.  I checked as soon as I reached B rank and then just before entering the official B turney.  Also the monster didn&#39;t age a year in that time so I don&#39;t think it was due to that.  I didn&#39;t battle at all between the officials either. <BR> <BR>Back to the drawing board for a new theory...maybe its linked to the monsters life phases &#40;if they exist in this game&#41;.  If this is true its the only way I know of to really judge a monsters current phase in this game.

 I haven&#39;t been doing much in the way of studies on this, but I&#39;ve been keeping a half-eye on it. Did you fight at all between those ranks? Maybe the only reason people are seeing it raise between ranks is that the monsters are only battling those official tournaments?

 Except that, as I said above, a move changed and I didn&#39;t do any battling during that time. <BR> <BR>On a side note: in each battle I used the move once &#40;and successfully hit, but I don&#39;t think that matters&#41;. <BR> <BR># times used doesn&#39;t affect it <BR>age &#34;in years&#34; doesn&#39;t affect it <BR>monster&#39;s class doesn&#39;t affect it <BR>But it does change. <BR> <BR>I think my next test will be to get a buddy move on a new monster and then simply rest the monster through its lifespan and see if it changes. <BR>OR <BR>Discover if it always changes the same way &#40;a repeat of the above experiment for X Smash again&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think these moves not only change but can change differently.

 Maybe the number of tourneys, number of wins/losses, and number of opponents affect it?

 Normally I won&#39;t post guesses but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s related to your monster&#39;s stats.
