 I&#39;ve been raising a Zuum/Antlan named Enduro, who has inherited the Expert and IronHart traits from one of the special Zuums.  My problem is that he seems to constantly get stressed unless I feed him Mint Leaves at every oppurtunity-- and sometimes when I&#39;d prefer not to.  Is this the downside of the Expert characteristic, or is it something else?  I am putting him through a tougher regimin than most of my monsters due to his IronHart characteristic, which keeps him from getting tired easily but doesn&#39;t prevent stress.  Still, it seems like I&#39;m getting an excessive degree of stress warnings.

 It&#39;s possible that he&#39;s too skinny. You might want to check his weight, and give him a few doses of meat on top of it. I&#39;ve found that even when the monster is listed as &#39;normal&#39;, it&#39;s on the lower end of &#39;normal&#39;, and thus treats it as if it&#39;s skinny.  <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t had Expert and Ironhart together, but my SO has, and not reported any particular stress-problems. Then again, he runs a heavy regime of mint candy, and that probably helps the monsters stay plumper.

 Yeah, my guy is constantly having to eat Meat Slabs and Cheese to stay normal, though getting stressed even when I usually kept him Normal.  I didn&#39;t realize that they could be affected by the &#34;borderline.&#34;  I&#39;ll try to remember that for my next monster- Enduro&#39;s ready to retire now.  And since I didn&#39;t notice Expert being all that awesome, I think I&#39;ll take it off with surgery before setting him to coaching duty.

Expert doesn&#39;t seem to be that good to me either. I have  <BR>noticed stress problems with my Ironhart monsters before  <BR>though Nate. Like KS said, Mint Candy works better in the  <BR>long run, and it will add to their form, thus keeping them  <BR>fatter. With my best Ironhart monsters &#40;arrowheads&#41; I found  <BR>with the proper mix of nuts oil, and Mint candy I could get  <BR>in 5 or 6 heavy drills during their prime, but that only  <BR>lasted part of a year. <BR> <BR>My thinking is that the tolerance for drills is much  <BR>smoother than in previous MR games &#40;less like steps and  <BR>more like a bell curve&#41; has anyone else noticed this? <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="-2">00</FONT>

 Here here. It&#39;s most definitely a bell curve, though there do seem to be some small steps in it. However, I&#39;ve noticed that the tolerance for the drills _and_ the actual numbers they get goes up in the same way. Not sure if that has to do with weight or age, but it&#39;s rather noticiable with new monsters, even more than bred ones, I find.

I guess what i meant is that the stages seem much shorter  <BR>than previous games, a matter of weeks instead of months.  <BR>It&#39;s hard to tell for me, since having top of the line coaches  <BR>tends to &#34;flatten&#34; the curve. I spend a lot more time at the  <BR>top &#40;30,20&#43; for hard drills&#41; than I did &#34;back in the day&#34; :&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="-2">00</FONT>

 Yeah, after having this coach system, I&#39;m going to be so spoiled on stat gains when MR4 comes out.

 &#34;Back in the day&#34; I could only get a max stat of 800&#43;&#40;int&#41; with other stats severely neglected. Now I have Mews and Galis that have at least 600 in every stat except Life and Defense&#40;not much of a problem because speed is super high...&#41;
