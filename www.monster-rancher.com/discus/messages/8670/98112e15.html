 While training an Octopee/Octopee, Pass: F, I gained the triat Up IQ, and then soon lost it.  After some trial and error I noticed a definate pattern. <BR>If Int is its highest stat, it has Up IQ.  If not, it doesn&#39;t.  Always. <BR> <BR>I would appreciate it if somebody else would verify this and perhaps post any other triats they can predictably gain &#40;or lose&#41; with specific breeds.

 Up IQ comes and goes for a lot of monsters. It&#39;s not based on INT being the highest stat, but it&#39;s based on training in INT. When you train in INT &#40;either slot for a hard drill&#41; it will bring up Up IQ the longer you go with no INT training, Up IQ will eventually disappear.

 At least with an Octopee/Octopee it&#39;s nice to know it&#39;ll be there automatically &#40;asuming there is an empty slot&#41; when INT is the greatest stat. <BR>Due to Octopee&#39;s attacks and even stat gains it&#39;s useful to choose to maintain atleast slightly higher INT as higher stats in other areas don&#39;t yeild other traits &#40;I haven&#39;t even tried DEF, though&#41;.

 None that I have seen. I have never earned anything like Up Power in the numerous Golems I&#39;ve trained. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;ll say it again, having INT as the highest stat is not a guarantee of getting Up IQ. It works differently than that. See my above post.

 I have to call doubts on that, Goldenboy. As soon as my monster got below the intelligence at highest, it lost High IQ. And as soon as I trained it, High IQ came back. I&#39;ve never had it when the monster had anything but Intelligence at its highest point. It worked like clockwork for me.

 Thank you for backing me up Kurasu. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t seen this work for any monsters other than Octopee and I haven&#39;t noticed any other traits in octopee like it.  But if there is one in the game perhaps more can be found.

 Well,  HiIQ can only be passed by sparring. So I seriously doubt that wat Kurasu is saying is at all true.  If you are talking about Up IQ, you might have a case.  However, I can blow that theory right out of the water since my Golem just got a random occurrence of Up IQ with an Int of only 196.  My highest stat is his power at 641.  So, Up IQ probably has a good chance of being around when your highest stat is Int, but it is absolutely NOT required.  I am not saying that your phenomena is invalid, it&#39;s just not a perfect rule. <BR> <BR>-Thorr

 You&#39;re right, Thorr. I meant Up IQ. Sorry for the confusion on that. The only place I&#39;ve gotten Hi anything is with the doc. <BR> <BR>However,  with up IQ, I&#39;ve gotten it with a mocchi, a suzarin, and a Torridon in  the same way as well: intelligence being the highest, and as soon as it was no longer highest, the monster lost it.  <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right. It isn&#39;t a perfect rule. However, it does seem there are several monsters where this is a definite way to get it. Namely, ones that are particularly good in intelligence?

 Dragons also gain UP IQ this way. <BR>     It seams all of these monsters have better statgains in their Non-Inteligence abilities &#40;although octopee seams even&#41;.

 ANY monster can get it Up IQ!!! <BR>Don&#39;t overanalyze it, its just the way it happens. Please reread my first post in this thread. It has not been disproven, it still holds true. <BR>Monsters I&#39;ve had with Up IQ: <BR>Arrowhead <BR>Doodle <BR>Dragon <BR>Gali <BR>Garu <BR>Gitan <BR>Golem <BR>Hare <BR>Henger <BR>Joker <BR>Lesione <BR>Mew <BR>Monol <BR>Phoenix <BR>Pixie <BR>Tiger <BR> <BR>Until you find a monster that cannot get Up IQ when you train in INT, let&#39;s let this rest OK?

 Fine, if I&#39;m training an Octopee/Octopee Pass: F or Dragon/Dragon Pass: - and his INT doesn&#39;t become his highest stat he WILL NOT get Up IQ from training INT!! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not talking about surgery or training w/ coaches who have Up IQ.  And I&#39;m just looking for patterns in aquiring traits MRA2.

 If GoldenBoy is correct &#40;and he has a good track record&#41; then any monster can gain Up IQ predictably. <BR>This is information is useful. <BR> <BR>If they bothered to code this they could have easily linked traits for other stats but I personally haven&#39;t noticed any. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always been able to get Popular by remaining undefeated.  I&#39;ve also never had a monster with a loss in its record aquire aquire Popular.  I&#39;m not sure how many wins are neccessary but I&#39;m sure it can be found. <BR> <BR>For those of us do don&#39;t wish to hire a coach, use a different password, or dish out the cash and reset like crazy durring surgery for traits some can be aquired just through game play.  I&#39;d like to find out which ones can. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve had a Golem/Golem gain dignity from I don&#39;t know what but I&#39;d like to find out.  Especially if it could lead to getting StatKing.

 My Dragon got Popluar because it won the First AGIMA Offical match very soon after being born... but then it lost it in my next tourney when i lost two matches, and got second place. <BR> <BR>&#40;This might not be that reliable, because i wasn&#39;t really paying attention to how long I had popular&#41;

 I also was able to gain Popular after my monster won the Offical E Cup his first time to a battle.  I checked his info after each battle to see if it might show up before the battle ended and it didn&#39;t but his fame went up 21 after the 5 battles. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve trained a few monsters who have lost popular and 21 is more fame than I could get. <BR> <BR>It would be interesting to find out if anybody has gained Popular w/out the monster reaching D rank. <BR> <BR>I believe this is a very easy trait to gain &#40;and easy to lose&#41;.  But not too useful as traits are limited to 6 and popularity isn&#39;t very useful.  So I&#39;m going to try and work on other characteristics.

 Popular is useful to get fame, which makes you monster happier, and more reliable and work harder. <BR> <BR>It is also still up in the air whether or not it helps make Soulmates. I have gone back and forth on that, and I currently think it does.

 I&#39;m just about to create a new monster... so I can check to see if Popular can only be gained at the first Offical E match... I&#39;ll be back later with results...

 I have an idea, I&#39;ll answer this now, Mew, class E official: 5 wins, Popular not aquired. Same monster, class D official: 4 wins and 1 knockout, popular not aquired. Same monster, class C official:5 knockouts, popular aquired. Two months later, no match fought, popular lost, charisma aquired via supercoach Morgan. And for a bit of a reply to GB&#39;s post, popular does help make friends: Tiger: Popularity: 54, 9 out of 10 wilds only become &#34;friends&#34;, Tiger: popularity: 92, 9 out of 10 are &#34;best friends&#34;. Tiger: Popularity:100, 10 of 10 become &#34;best friends&#34; <BR>Most of the wilds made friends with were the same so it does prove something. As for the popular thing, you can&#39;t be accurate with just any monster, my mocchi was born with and retired with popular, my Mew as you can see, didn&#39;t, and a Dragon I trained knocked out all his E class official opponents and still didn&#39;t get, actually, he never had it once throughout his life.

 Here, you&#39;re talking about the popular trait, so I wanted to say something about it. I have a monster that had the Popular trait right from the shrine. I&#39;ll have to check and see what monster it was, but maybe some monsters are more likely to get it? Maybe not. <BR>I know it was a Suzurin- some sub of it. I will check.

 Okay, I finally get around to telling you what Suzurin it was, it was SparkRing. The special Naga Miasman has Popular to begin with as well.
