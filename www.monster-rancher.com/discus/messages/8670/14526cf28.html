 I&#39;ve entered a few tournaments where I find a monster colored pure gold. They&#39;re not specials, not bred with anything that would give them this color, they&#39;re just colored golden. Does anyone know how and why this happens? &#42;Dreams of golden Joker&#42; <BR> <BR>~Cannon

 Well...  I booted the game up to see what the heck you were talking about and found my save game is gone..  Looks like my game will no longer save. :&#40; <BR> <BR> In all honesty, I don&#39;t remember anything special about the monsters you are talking about.  I know that they are not available for raising.

 I booted up my MRA1 game to see if it survived, and it still runs.  My Gespenst is still there in town. <BR> <BR>  It makes me think that the MRA2 battery system is pretty fragile.  I was not one to use the Never Tired raising method, so I didn&#39;t kill it that way.  Oh well..

 Ah, sorry to hear that,  seeing all the hard work you put into this  <BR>game, and I really appreciate it. But hey, you can get a fresh  <BR>start. I myself bought a copy of the game for fourteen bucks off  <BR>eBay. Thanks again for all the hard work you &#40;along with  <BR>GoldenBoy&#41; put into this. <BR> <BR>Anyway, the golden monsters. Yeah, they&#39;re just pure gold. I&#39;ve  <BR>run into a Momo, a Tiger, and a Hare like this. My friend who  <BR>also has the game claims he saw a golden Golem. He also claims  <BR>to have seen the Momo. A thing to note is that these are  <BR>absoluely no stronger than any other monsters I&#39;ve seen.

 I&#39;ve never seen a &#34;golden&#34; monster in MRA2 before. In all honesty, I do think you&#39;re looking at a case where the monsters are bred with something to give them that colour, in particular, a Suezo or Mew. They&#39;re yellow, but under some light, a few of the monsters that combine with them appear sort of gold. <BR> <BR>I just checked - my MRA2 battery has always worked fine. That being said, I think you may have played yours more, Thorr, so I guess we&#39;ll see how much longer mine lasts...

 Double post in light of the fact that your most recent post wasn&#39;t there when I wrote my reply: <BR> <BR>A Suezo or Mew obviously cannot account for something like a golden Tiger, and none of the ones in the book look golden at all to me. <BR> <BR>&#34;Weird&#34; is all I have left to say.

 Strange. Has anyone tried combining with a Gold Bar? I have  <BR>neither the time nor the Gold Bar to experiment with this.  <BR>Anyone willing to try? <BR> <BR>~Cannon

 I think you can get a gold bar easily enough.  There are tournaments that give them as prizes, iirc.

 I&#39;ll test this out. I think i have a gold bar sitting around accumulating dust so i&#39;ll try it with the four suggested monsters&#40;Momo, Tiger, Hare and Golem&#41;to see what happens.

 Tested this out a little while ago. The gold bar does nothing when used in combining. As previously suggested it seems likely that these were simply monsters combined with yellow sub-breeds. The only problem with this theory is, as Infernus said, there are no yellow tigers in the game. <BR> <BR>I am not saying that golden monsters don&#39;t exist; just that it seems unlikely they are created through combining with a gold bar &#40;unless it is like some of the Legends that require specific combinations for the desired result&#41;. <BR> <BR>Personally I&#39;ve never seen a &#34;gold&#39; monster so I see no reason to continue testing all possibilities, but I am quite curious to see if this is true.
