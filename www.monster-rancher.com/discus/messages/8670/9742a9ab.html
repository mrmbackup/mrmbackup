It time for an MR version of the Meyers-Briggs Type indicator! <BR> <BR>Seriously, there are a lot of different personalities &#40;listed as type in your monster info screen&#41;. This is to start to catalog them and get a list going. Eventually we can start to work on descriptions of the effects of each, since the game doesn&#39;t provide them. <BR> <BR>Now don&#39;t take the descriptions as gospel. They are based only on my own observation raising that type of monster. If you disagree, post about your experience. <BR> <BR>Please post any others you&#39;ve encountered.

 I have had Nervous on most of my Durahans.  Which, I suppose, makes perfect sense considering that there is a calm.  The effects have amounted to me having to shell out Mint Leaves every week some months

 I don&#39;t know if anyone has seen this before but just recently&#40;spelling?&#41; I got HotTemper on a hare. I don&#39;t know if this is exactly true but compared to other hares I&#39;ve trained&#40;from the same password without HotTemper though&#41; this one seemed to get fury about twice as much.

 Yeah, I had a couple of Hares with Hot Temper too.  I think HT also modifies your monsters stats in battle b/c I used to remember how my Hares would lose 50 def points for 50 speed points.  Maybe the stat change in battle is determined by your monster, or when it gets annoyed it loses defense to dodge attacks or hit better &#40;a la pseudo beserk mode?&#41;.  I gotta check this personality out whenever I have the chance.

 Except for the 50 speed points that sounds like foresee, that gives you plus 80 speed.

 I&#39;m pretty sure Foresee adds 6% to Spd and subtracts 6% from Def, this would explain your different numbers. <BR> <BR>I do not know what Militant does, I&#39;ll check my Torridon and see if he has it.

 GoldenBoy, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s &#43;80spd. and -50 def. because when I first got my hare it&#39;s stats were as follows: <BR>144,87,120,140,103,98, in battle speed went up 80, defense down 50 here&#39;s it&#39;s stats now: 770,654,640,549,663,604, in battle speed still goes up 80, defense still goes down 50, as you can see I&#39;ve trained it to componsate for those stat changes.&#40;Also, I&#39;m having trouble getting my e-mails from this site, I still get them from my friends and stuuf...is there something wrong?&#41;

 I checked my profile, and everything is as it should be, the little box for MRA2 is checked etc., and that is my e-mail, and, although it&#39;s unoticable there, there is an underscore between blue and inferno. I don&#39;t know whats going wrong, I&#39;ve gotten e-mails from here properly up until today :&#40; :&#34;&#40;.

 Some work done on the &#34;Proud&#34; personality with my tigers. It would appear that they gain loyalty slower than other monsters, also, they tend to fail drills more often when you ease up on them&#40;Be mean,be very very mean with proud monsters!...jk,just don&#39;t spoil or pamper them.&#41;. This was tested with 2 different personality monsters from the same password&#40;one proud, one normal&#41;. If anyone else wants to try and see if I&#39;m wrong they can, I used the password 002&#40;zeroes&#41; for a Scarlet&#40;Tiger/Szurin&#41;. <BR>BTW,I never realized how hard it was to keep up around here w/o the e-mails :&#34;&#40;

 Just for those who are curious, the proud Scarlet lived longer, had better stats and was more loyal in the end. The reasons for this is most likely because I was able to do more hard drills without it getting stressed out. As for the loyalty, I don&#39;t know what happened here but, in the end, I could feed it nothing and it only lost 1 loyalty compared to normal Scarlet&#39;s 3.

 I&#39;ve started trying this with JammHat &#40;Henger/Suezo&#41;. It&#39;s from combining and has no password&#40;so sorry&#41;. As with the proud Scarlet, the proud JammHat fails it&#39;s first drills for about 1-2 months. I do only hard drills. Although the proud monsters seem to fail more often they do quite well in sparring&#40;thats probably because they can&#39;t fail...&#41;. Again, I&#39;m going to ask that someone else test this out, I&#39;m not sure of myself. <BR>P.S the normal ones succeed in there first drill anywhere between the 2nd and 5th week.

 I had a Pixie &#40;Pixie=Pixie&#41; that had &#34;Joker&#34; and the only thing different about her was that she was always getting wierd Traits. One time she got Farsight, I know that that happens to a lot of monsters, but not at 1yr-10m. During her life she got: Farsight, Nearsight, Failure, Listless, Slump, and Worn Out. Every bad trait, I know it might have not been &#34;Joker&#34;, but I think it was.

 I think unless you can post more about your personal raising method, what items you have and use, what sorts of things you did. I won&#39;t buy into that idea. I am much more willing to believe that you hit the gamut of bad traits because you don&#39;t have the hang of Pixies than I am to believe it was Joker. I have had Joker personality monsters before and never had that much trouble.

 My experiences with cowards have been that they dodge better than normal.  Same species, same raising style, just different personalities.  Where my cowardly tigers would have no problem dodging, I have to worry about my normal one &#40;all of which I&#39;ve found while trying to unlock Whitehound; note that I haven&#39;t seen any physical stat difference&#41;.  Can anybody else confirm this idea?

 I think that Joker means they pick up traits from coachs/sparring partners a bit more often. I noticed that most of my Pixies have been Jokers and those monster got the extra traits more often than my others.

 I noticed all personalitys have parallels. But normal probably dosn&#39;t. Meaning there is a personalitys we may not have yet. Just a guess. P.S.- Am I being a pest, I don&#39;t want to be and i&#39;d like to know?
