<CENTER>You must be a member of Monster Rancher Metropolis to post messages.  <BR> <BR>We expect everyone read the entire Office Of The Mayor before applying for an account.  <BR> <BR><B>An application for an account is your assurance to us that  <BR>you have read all the posting guidelines and agree to them.</B></CENTER> <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Anyone under 13 years of age must provide written consent from their parent/guardian before posting anything on this site. See our <B>Privacy Policy</B> for more information.</FONT> <BR> <BR>The cookie system automatically inserts user information into multiple posts during an online session. This means that a user with an account must type in his/her username and password, in the boxes provided, in the first post made during each online session. Then, in each subsequent post during that online session, the software automatically inserts the username and email link. &#40;If an email address was provided for the account.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Once an account is established, posters may change their password and email address at will. They can also set up the software to notify them, via email, of responses to their posted messages. These functions are found in the <B>Edit Profile</B> folder on left side of the board. <BR> <BR><I>Remember that by applying for an account, you agree to follow the site guidelines as outlined in the Office Of The Mayor.</I> <BR> <BR><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;&#42;&#42;</FONT>Obtaining An Account<FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;&#42;&#42;</FONT></B></CENTER>  <BR> <BR><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Email the Moderators at  <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">monster.rancher.metropolis@gmail.com</FONT> <BR>with ALL of the following five items:</FONT></B> <BR> <BR><B>1&#41;</B> Username: This is part of the password system and is NOT visible to the public. Make it easy to type, but make it a password type set of characters, not a word. You want this to be secure and not easily cracked by software or people making guesses. Do NOT use your real name as the username, since most common first names were taken long ago. &#40;and names are not secure at all&#41; Letters and numbers only, the first letter will be capitalized by the software &#40;so email something that starts with a capital letter&#41; but <B>NO</B> other letter can be a capital, and no spaces in it. Under_slashes are ok.  <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>There is a maximum limit of 15 characters. <BR> <BR><B>2&#41;</B> Password: Letters and numbers only, no caps and no spaces. You will be able to change this anytime you wish, once the account is set up. I strongly suggest a mix of numbers and letters in a nonsense jumble, not a real word. <BR> <BR><B>3&#41;</B> Board Name: The one you wish to be known by on the board. This is the name everyone sees. Spaces are ok here. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT> Nothing offensive allowed, Lisa&#39;s opinion is the final word on this subject. <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT> All names of monster breeds/types, alone or coupled with other words are taken or too close to existing member names; try to be more creative in choosing a name. Any name with the word &#34;Monster&#34; in it will also probably be rejected. <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42; Applications with board names containing monster breed names will be rejected.</FONT> <BR> <BR><B>4&#41;</B> Email Address:  This is optional. If you don&#39;t want an email link, when you send your request, specify NO EMAIL. If you choose the NO EMAIL option, be aware that you will have no way to prove account ownership in case of loss of your password. &#40;see password notes below&#41; If you do wish your email linked, we strongly recommend you use an account from a free email service that is not your primary Internet Service Provider. <BR> <BR><B>5&#41;</B> Your real date of birth: month/day/year. This info is not optional, but will not be used at all on the board. I just need you to certify that are of legal age to use the site. <I>Please type out the name of the month you were born in! I know there are different customs in some countries about how you write a date, I need to be clear about the name of the month so type the name not a number for the month.</I> <BR> <BR><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Be aware:</FONT></B>  <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>Incomplete applications will be rejected. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>Applications sent to email addresses other than the Moderators&#39; address &#40;in the <B>BOLD</B> sentence above the five items&#41; will be rejected. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>Accounts may be rejected for a variety of reasons. If a name is deemed offensive, violates the above guidelines, or is too similar to another user&#39;s name the application will be returned with a request for another board name or username. <BR>  <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>The Moderators have real world jobs, lives and families!!!  <BR>It may take 24 hours for you to get an account! Please use that time reading the FAQS, and other pertinent info on the site! Pestering us to set up the account faster is pointless! <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>Make sure that your email is set up to receive a reply email from us! If you block me us as a recipient, or your inbox is full, you will not receive your confirmation email! <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>Occasionally, email is &#39;lost in the mail&#39; or other technical problems may interfere with us replying to your email. If 4 or more days have past since you sent your application, try posting a message to see if your information has been entered into the system. <BR>  <BR><B>Troubleshooting Tips:</B> <BR>Make sure that when you post your first message of the session you ONLY type in your username and password. After clicking the &#34;Preview&#34; button, you should see your board name appear as the message author. It will be colored if you have chosen to link an email address, it will be in black type if there is no email linked to your account. <BR>After a successful first post, you should see your username appear in the username box, and a series of stars &#40;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#41; appear in the password box for subsequent posts. &#40;During that online session.&#41;When you click &#34;Preview&#34; your board name should appear as the message&#39;s author. <BR><B>Remember, the cookies do not persist if you close your browser. Everytime you log on line, you must go through the first post proceedure.</B> <BR> <BR>If you lose or forget your password, please note that I cannot retrieve passwords, I can only delete passwords and create new ones. I delete the original emails from people setting up new accounts, for security reasons. If you lose your password, you need to apply for a new password. We need to see an email originating from the email currently associated with the account, as proof of ownership. If you created your account with the NO EMAIL option, you will have to apply for an entirely new account, with a new board name if you lose your password. <BR> <BR>Accounts may be revoked at any time. Posters who violate board policies, see the <B>Welcome Message</B> for details, may have their accounts revoked at any time, without warning. <BR> <BR>Also note that the chatroom requires a separate account with our chat provider, delphiforums.com. They handle all troubleshooting for those accounts. And, just because you have a chat account does not mean you have set up a message board account -you still need to apply for a message board account in the usual way. <BR> <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis reserves the right to refuse accounts to anyone, based on opinions formed by chatroom behavior, message board posts at other websites, or for any other reason.
