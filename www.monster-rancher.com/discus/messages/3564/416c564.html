Monster Rancher Metropolis tries to maintain a friendly, fun message board where gamers can discuss their experiences and publish original fiction. Most of our visitors are adults, and all visitors are expected to treat others with respect and courtesy. Our goal is to maintain concise guides for the Monster Rancher games. <BR>From time to time Moderators working on the board will delete messages. We have limted space &#40;until someone is willing to donate a substantial grant&#41;, and must chose what we keep with great care. The criteria for deletion include &#40;but are not limited to&#41; the following problems: <BR> <BR>1&#41; The post was of little interest, or off-topic. <BR>   Example: &#34;me too&#34; &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; &#34;This is <FONT COLOR="ff0000">RED!</FONT>&#34; &#34;I like Duckman!&#34; <BR> <BR>2&#41; The post duplicated information on the board, or was posted without regard to information already stored in the archives. <BR> <BR>3&#41; The purpose of the post was to demean others. <BR>   Example: &#34;You&#39;re an idiot.&#34; &#34;Shut up!&#34; <BR> <BR>4&#41; The post contained racist comments. <BR> <BR>5&#41; The post contained content which was deemed inappropriate for a family audience. <BR> <BR>6&#41; The post was made with another board regular&#39;s username; &#34;impostoring&#34;. <BR> <BR>7&#41; The post was not relevant to the board. <BR> <BR>8&#41; The post was threatening or inflammatory. <BR> <BR>9&#41; The post contained personal information about another person. <BR> <BR>10&#41; The post was written by someone under 13 years of age who did not have consent from their parent or guardian. <BR> <BR>11&#41; The post contained discussion of illegal activities, including but not limited to, copyright infringement and trade in illegal copies of games. <BR> <BR>12&#41; The post contained false information. We strive for high quality content. Attempts to undermine the trust of our readers with deliberately false &#34;information&#34; will not be tolerated. <BR> <BR>13&#41; The post contained information that cannot be confirmed through peer testing. If only one person can get the result, we will not archive the post. <BR> <BR>14&#41; The post contained copyrighted material not belonging to the person posting. <BR> <BR>15&#41; The post contained unfounded claims, made with no research having been done at all. While we will check and review researchers&#39; work, we will not go out and do the entire research process for people who have &#34;great ideas&#34; but no interest in doing any testing at all. <BR> <BR>People who repeatedly post messages which require deletion due to objectionable or false content may be suspended for a probationary period, or permanently banned from posting, at the discretion of the moderators. Lisa&#39;s opinion is final in these matters. Attempting to have board elections for re-instatement will result in permanent banning.
