 Well, my extreme layoff from video games has concluded and I am raring to go on a quest to complete a monster. Maxing each of it stats.  <BR> <BR>The degree of difficulty is much higher than any before, so this project may take many months and will be the result of a lot of trial and error production.  <BR> <BR>I will document each &#39;case&#39; or monster I raise. I will do my best to checkup here and give a post that explains each venture. If you are willing to try to break the methodical 4,000 barrier join me. It&#39;s a simple invitation, I hope I can provide a great amount of information that could bring this game back to the way it was.  <BR> <BR>This will be my final word as the project begins at 3:48PM EST.  <BR> <BR>From Ohio, blasting off.

 Somewhat, I&#39;m more geared towards MR4 as of the moment. I might get together with Diablo and see if we couldn&#39;t enter one together. If I do enter that it won&#39;t be until later in the summer.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve gone out and bought a pamplet and all that good stuff so I can track this down. MR2 would be something to give me a mental break from what I&#39;m sure to encounter.  <BR> <BR>I will however do my very best to try to get into that tournament. I won&#39;t promise it, but I do promise to attempt to reached new levels in MR4. It will be more of an exploration, hopefully discovering new things.  <BR> <BR>I will post what I write down, down to the week if I can hopefully manage useful information that would put Harrab, PT or Infernus to shame. ;&#41;  <BR> <BR>So, I&#39;ll play that by ear, but chances are if someone enters before me I&#39;ll probably be more willing to make a monster than I would if I&#39;m not guaranteed a match.  <BR> <BR>-GG

 Oh, Lisa. If you&#39;re still there I have a question. Is the stress and fatigue max out of 100? I saw that certain items can lower it by 10, 20 or whatever.

 In mr4, I dunno, in mr2 it can go over 100.

 Reporting back after two weeks of raising.  <BR> <BR>Well, I ended up deleting my original save so I started from scratch and reached about 10 years. I however am feeling sort of discouraged with the maxing of a monster when I break it down into numbers.  <BR> <BR>For example, lets take the longest living monster in the game and assume it never has to rest.  <BR> <BR>The monster is a Golem with 224 weeks of life, now lets say it starts out with 100 in each stat giving it a comp. of 600.  <BR> <BR>This process is pretty simple &#40;and hopefully I&#39;m doing it right&#41;. The max comp. is 5994, so we&#39;ll subtract 600 from it, which gives us.  <BR>5394 points to gain in 224 weeks.  <BR> <BR>So we divide the lifespan by comp. remaining and get a need of 24.080 gain a week to complete the monster, now this is assuming no lifespan hits or weeks of rest. So battling and adventure is out of the question.  <BR> <BR>The number only gets bigger, let&#39;s say you rest the monster 25% of it&#39;s life &#40;once every 4 weeks&#41;, so you&#39;ll take 24.0 and divide it by 25% or .25, which gives us a happy number of 96 a week.  <BR> <BR>Now we considering combing, my best combo totaled 999, which we&#39;ll round up to 1,000 for simplicity sake. This lowers the number to 4,994 left to gain. Now lets assume the monster is a Golem once more with 224 weeks of lifepspan. The extra 400 added to the comp. only decreases the number by 2, so we end up with a need of 22 a week.  <BR> <BR>Once again assuming no rest. The number when divided by .25 &#40;the assumed amount of life wasted being rested&#41; makes the number 89 a week.  <BR> <BR>This isn&#39;t really research, just something to be considered and stressed the importantance of needing a few factors in maxing a monster. Rest is the biggest obstacle to date in maxing a monster.  <BR> <BR>The monster will also need to perform at an excellent rate every week without rest, which means focus will have to be controlled.  <BR> <BR>This game is quite the brain buster.

 My first post here, and I&#39;m using it to correct math. &#42;l&#42; Ain&#39;t that always the way? <BR> <BR>MrGG, by the division you have going on &#40;&#34;The number only gets bigger&#34;, etc.&#41;, your monster&#39;s sleeping THREE weeks out of the month. Dividing by .25 is the same as multiplying by four, and implies you have 1/4 the time to devote to raising your monster&#39;s stats. What you mean to do is this... <BR> <BR>Keeping with the 224 weeks and assuming 1 week sleep a month &#40;1/4 of the alloted time&#41; leaves 224 x .75 = 168 weeks of work. <BR>5394 / 168 = 32.1 points of stat gain per week needed &#40;in the right stats!&#41; <BR> <BR>Pardon me while I faint...

 If you hate math than dont plan on getting a maxxed monster in MR4 until someone finds out how! <BR>&#40;If it even is possible&#41;

<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'blister'-!>
We&#39;ve gone over different scenarios with the mathematics, and all things considered, maxxed in MR4 is highly unlikely unless we figure out something that gets rid of stress and fatigue more effectively. <BR> <BR>Essentially, I am of the belief that Shrimp &#40;food item&#41;, Vitamin &#40;food item&#41;, Oily Oil &#40;luxury item&#41;, Rose Perfume &#40;luxury item&#41;, as well as a good combo monster with Iron Heart &#40;trait&#41;, combined again with Wonder Well, Wind Drum, Sweet Incense, Bragma Statue, Artemis Statue, and Aroma Pot &#91;Gadgets&#93;, and finally, intense, healing, and magic gadgets of the correct levels &#40;I&#39;m not going in to that&#41; are great items to have - some are essential. <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;Also, Watermelons. Forgot them. <BR> <BR>I am also of the belief that Larox and Trokatin &#91;Drugs&#93; don&#39;t let on everything they offer. This is all speculation from someone who has in fact tried these items in different ways, but not actually achieved the uber 999&#39;s across the board. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say it is possible, but it requires far more math than this, as well as a plan for every single time span between when you can switch gadgets. <BR> <BR>Wow, now I actually want to do this...despite there being no real point. I suppose it would be just to see if I could.

 I got a couple plans for ya Infernus. <BR> <BR>1&#41; Get a monster all 666 in stats. <BR>   Find a comfy chair and play upside down. <BR> <BR>or <BR> <BR>2&#41; Go to nearest wall and find a beam.  <BR>   Commence knocking your head against it.  <BR>   Then wait for MR5 to hit the shores. <BR> <BR>   I&#39;ve tried both but recommend neither. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;dang wrong pass <BR>&#42;dang wrong pass <BR>&#42;dang wrong pass <BR> <BR>&#42;AH HA got it

 Ooooh, snap. Long time no see. Thing with MR4 is, despite its flaws, I still like it...and that would probably die with me maxxing a monster. <BR> <BR>I play for competition, and to do things that I&#39;ve never done before. <BR> <BR>Honestly, minimal interest in MR5, I&#39;d like to go back to the glory days of MR2 at the moment. If you read this, and somehow manage to remember how &#40;pass and what not&#41;, come into chat, you nut.

 Yeah it has been awhile. Blame that on going for a CPA. Anywho I&#39;ve got a night class in about 30 minutes. Too bad AC or MR hasn&#39;t gone online yet over here. Would love to wipe the floor with ya. I&#39;ll try to catch ya later.
