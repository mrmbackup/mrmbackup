 I just recently started a new game because I lost my memory card from my old game &#40;=&#91;&#41;. I still have the first Garu &#40;it&#39;s about 2 years and 5 months old&#41;. <BR> <BR>I definitely didn&#39;t think that this would be considered &#34;old&#34; for a monster, but I&#39;ve noticed that even when doing a drill like &#34;ukemi,&#34; or &#34;high jump,&#34; it gets tired very quickly; my other monsters get half as tired from doing such drills, but they&#39;re younger. <BR> <BR>This never happened in my other game with the same Garu that one gets in the very beginning of the game, so can anyone explain what is happening? I&#39;ve had plenty of monsters retire before, and none of them ever got this tired so quickly, and when my Garu was young, it didn&#39;t get this tired either. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not going to be able to use this for combining or anything, so it&#39;s not like this really matters that much, but I&#39;d really like to get a heads up on something I might be doing wrong with other monsters that do matter. I&#39;m thinking that maybe it&#39;s weight has something to do with it &#40;I think it&#39;s a little overweight, but it&#39;s always been like that even though my other monsters are all normal&#41;.

 We always tend to forget how much rougher life is for early monsters compared to later in the game. My guess is that your later monsters in your first game had the advantage of some items on the ranch to help reduce stress and fatigue. There&#39;s also a good chance that you ha a different feeding schedule.

 Thanks, that does sound right; I only have the Well on my ranch right now because that&#39;s all I&#39;ve found in the effects gadgets in this game. I went back to check the forms of my other monsters and they&#39;re all normal, though, so I think that has something to do with it. For some reason, for my Garu it says &#34;Fat&#34; and all the others are &#34;normal.&#34; <BR> <BR>It just said my Garu is getting old and that I have to start taking more care of it. I&#39;ll see if the same thing happens with my other monsters when they get older.
