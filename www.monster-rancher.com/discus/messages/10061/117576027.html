Ok, I wasn&#39;t too sure if being hungry just caused the monster to have worst gains or if it also caused some lifespan lost.. So... I tested it. <BR> <BR>Using T6-T10 of the Pixie Lifespan Experiment &#40;Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 4 Archive &#40;PS2&#41;: Miscellaneous Q&amp;A &#40;Post New Questions Here&#41; : Pixie Lifespan Tests&#41; I set out to test lifespan. What I did was I starved both T6 and T9 giving them no food for the last 2 months of their life &#40;8mo1wk to 10mo1wk&#41;. All other variables that were in the lifespan test were kept constant.  <BR> <BR><B>8mo4wk</B> T6 becomes Hungry <BR>T9 becomes Hungry <BR><B>9mo1wk</B> T6 becomes Starving <BR> <BR>Interesting enough Even though during the lifespan test both monsters were fed potato&#39;s throughout there lives T9 Didn&#39;t go to starving like T6 did. Don&#39;t know why but it didn&#39;t effect anything. When T6 went to the starving status she started drooping and showing signs of pain &#40;poor thing&#41; <BR> <BR><B>9mo2wk</B> T6 has no food showing in the bar <BR>T9 has no food showing in the bar <BR><B>9mo4wk</B> T6 Retires <BR>T9 Retires <BR><B>10mo1wk</B> T7, T8, T10 retire <BR> <BR>Ok, so in this case they took a lifespan hit because of hungryness. Dunno if this&#39;ll be the case for all monsters. If this is a pixie thing. Or what. More testing is needed of course. Another test Another Day.  <BR> <BR>Any Questions, Comments, or the likewise?

Ok I did a little more research on this I kept all the variable that were in the experiment above constant but i started varying how many weeks the pixies were starving. I think i got a good way to show how i fed the monster so i&#39;ll try that. <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD><B>X</B></TD><TD><B>T6</B></TD><TD><B>T7</B></TD><TD><B>T8</B></TD><TD><B>T9</B></TD><TD><B>T10</B></TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>8/1</B></TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>Potato</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>8/2</B></TD><TD>Potato</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>Potato</TD><TD>None</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>8/3</B></TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>Pork</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>8/4</B></TD><TD>Potato</TD><TD>Vitamin</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>9/1</B></TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>Hungry</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>9/2</B></TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>Hungry</TD><TD>Hungry</TD><TD>None </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>9/3</B></TD><TD>None</TD><TD>None</TD><TD>Empty</TD><TD>Starving</TD><TD>Hungry </TD></TR><TR><TD><B>9/4</B></TD><TD>None</TD><TD>Vitamin</TD><TD>Died</TD><TD>Empty</TD><TD>Starving</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>As you can &#40;or cannot&#41; see at 7 weeks of starving the monster died but 6 weeks of starving the monster lives. this is of course with the monster being Fat &#40;maybe the fattest possible in the game&#41; More testing needed as always. Another Day another test. <BR> <BR>Any Questions, Comments, Or the likewise? &#40;Would appreciate if you tell me if you like this table better or those timelines.&#41;

 Either way of showing us works. I&#39;m curious to see where this experiment goes. I wonder how  in the long run this affects lifespan. Other than just in the dramatic full on starving of a monster till death. That would take a long time to figure out and you would have to eliminate a lot of variables though.
