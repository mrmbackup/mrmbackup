 I&#39;ve read the pages that talk about medals and tried searching in the &#43; dungeons and I still have not found a single medal. I&#39;ve found all kinds of tablets and stones but no medals. If you can clue me in on places that seem to have them more often than others, please do.

 It looks like getting medals is sheer luck. You could go over a dozen times and not find a single one. <BR> <BR>Anecdotal evidence suggests that the tougher the dungeon, the greater the chance of your finding a medal. There&#39;s no trick to it, so you&#39;d might as well press on and hope you get one.

 99% of the medals you are likely to ever get, will be from any adventures floor of 8 or higher. I also noticed this theory seems to apply to alot of special gadgets also, that come on the gold tablets. <BR> <BR>It greatly increases your chances if you use a monster with Lucky Star trait. <BR> <BR>I did 11 adventure runs and ended with 11 medals. So I don&#39;t think the rate of finding them is &#34;that&#34; rare, it is time consuming&#40;15-30 minutes per run&#41; though. <BR> <BR>I did 1 Togle Caves&#34;&#43;&#34; run, and recieved 1 Lucky Medal on the 8th floor in a red chest. <BR> <BR>I did 10 Kawrea Volcano runs, and recieved 1 intense medal as a fight reward on the 6th floor, 2 healing medals as a fight reward on the 10th floors, and 1 magic, 1 intense, and 5 healing medals from red chests on various mixes of floors 8-10. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if healing medals are just generally the easiest medal to obtain, if they are just really common in kawrea region, or if i just landed a very odd spread for medals, but 7 out of 11 of my medals I recieved were healing. <BR> <BR>Every run I did was with a ducken with Lucky Star trait as my main monster, who had every search. <BR> <BR>So from what I can tell, the S ranked &#34;&#43;&#34; dungeons are not required to get medals. Since my theory is floors of 8 or higher are almost exclusively where to get the medals, that means the earliest chance to get medals is in promiass ruins, which has 1 floor worth of chances to get medals, kawrea volcano which has 3 floors worth of chances to get medals, and then the &#34;&#43;&#34; dungeons, which have 5 floors worth of chances to get medals. <BR> <BR>This may be less relevant, but I never once got a medal from any green chest. <BR> <BR>I hope this post helps someone.
