 I&#39;ve been going through several adventures as of late with my monsters, still trying to beat the last two &#43; stages, and came across some interesting information.  After trying to record the specific trait bonuses for each monster, I discovered that not every trait is equal on different monsters.  Some traits raise there beneficial traits greater then others, while sometimes traits that are supposed to be raised, aren&#39;t upped a full point at all.  Given this, I figured I&#39;d post what I found to be the basic rundown of traits. <BR> <BR>Fire Lore: &#43;&#43; Fire, &#43; Ice, - Wind <BR>Ice Lore: &#43;&#43; Ice, &#43; Earth, - Fire <BR>Thunder Lore: &#43;&#43; Thunder, &#43; Water, - Earth <BR>Water Lore: &#43;&#43; Water, &#43; Earth, - Thunder <BR>Wind Lore: &#43;&#43; Wind, &#43; Fire, - Ice <BR>Earth Lore: &#43;&#43; Earth, --Water, - Wind <BR>Heart Lore: &#43;&#43; Heart, - Magic, - Water <BR>Magic Lore: &#43;&#43; Magic, - Heart, &#43; Wind <BR> <BR>These last three, that being Earth, Heart, and Magic Lores, seem to be unusual in that the last slot does not always seem to be affected.  I&#39;ve had monsters that did not have any affect, or had unusual effects.  For example, one of my monsters learned Earth Lore and had &#43;1 Earth, -3 Water, while another had &#43;3 Earth, -2 Water, -1 Wind.  With this much variation in the traits, Breed/Subbreed definately has something to do with it somewhere, and more research is definately required.  However, to those that just want a general guideline for what traits to get for your monster, this can certainly help.

 ...If what your getting at is that monsters have elemental attributes to begin with then i thought that was obvious. <BR>Say, dragons naturally start good with fire. But certain sub breeds will take it down. <BR> <BR>From what i&#39;ve seen, the lores increase amounts by the same no matter what.

 Well, I thought that lores increase ammounts by the same no matter what too.  I originally was simply going to record the only what stats a lore affected negatively, cause that isn&#39;t posted anywhere so far.  But once I started to record the actual change for each lore on each monster, I discovered that lores can act differently depending on the monster.  But, don&#39;t take my word for it, feel free to do research on 5 or 6 different monsters and prove me wrong :&#41;

 Maybe you had a lore on already, and then put another lore on without taking off the previous one?

 What I did was record the stats of all the elements before the new lore was added, then recorded what it was later, and noted the difference.  Adding or taking off a particular elemental trait added/subtracted the exact same for that particular monster. <BR> <BR>I recorded the difference when a lore was added for each of my monsters, and quickly noticed that the results were different.  For three different monsters that got Fire Lore, the first had &#40;Think roller thingie/Hengar&#41; &#43;3 Fire, &#43;2 Ice, -2 Wind.  The second monster &#40;Golem/Hengar&#41; got &#43;3 Fire, &#43;1 Ice, -3 Wind.  The third monster &#40;Jell/Jell&#41; got &#43;1 Fire, -2 Wind. <BR> <BR>As you can see from just looking at the Fire Lore, recorded by the before/after stat difference, not all of the monsters gained elemental stats at the same rate.  Fire lore wasn&#39;t the only one that had differences.  I&#39;ve noted different gains for almost every single lore... and if I would have raised more monsters in my experiment I&#39;m sure I would have gotten differences for them all :&#41; <BR> <BR>The main reason that I posted the chart type thing is that people that wanted to work on their elemental stats would have an easier time knowing what not to pick.  Afterall, if your building up your Wind skill, its just as important to know to pick Wind and Ice lores as it is to know not to pick Fire and Earth :&#41;

 I&#39;ve observed the same things. I haven&#39;t actually looked closely at the numbers yet, but I&#39;ve noticed inconsistencies. And I was going to start to take notes and study elements to learn how to exploit them to the max. I&#39;ll let you know what I find.

 I&#39;ve researched this and will soon post something comprehensive. Meanwhile, I&#39;m archiving and closing this.
