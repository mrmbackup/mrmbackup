 Another test another disappointment for me. I set out to test how much lifespan adventures take away using a save 2 months before my pixies die &#40;See Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 4 Archive &#40;PS2&#41;: Miscellaneous Q&amp;A &#40;Post New Questions Here&#41; : Pixie Lifespan Tests for more information&#41; Heres what I did <BR> <BR>I had 5 pixies 2 of them only went of an adventure once and 2 of them went on the adventure twice the 3rd is my baseline pixie <BR>T1,T3, And T4 Went on an adventure on 8mo1wk <BR>T2,T3, And T4 Went on an adventure on 8mo3wk <BR>T1,T2,T3,T4 And T5 Died at 10mo1wk &#40;4yr2mo1wk old&#41; <BR> <BR>On adventures I ran from all monsters And went straight for the exit. I didn&#39;t pick up any items and when i got to the end of the first floor i went back to the ranch. No monsters hit my pixies at any time. I only saw 1 monster on the 1st adventure and i saw 7 monsters on the 2nd monster. I maintained all the variables i had for my experiment. <BR> <BR>I dunno if adventures are safe as long as you don&#39;t quit in the middle or it&#39;s a pixie thing but this is definately something Somebody needs to look into more. Another day another time. Happy Ranching

 hehehe ... its still needs a lot of research too... right now i&#39;m too busy with work so i barely have time for monster farm 4.... am playing fatal frame 2 too so my attention is pretty divided... and considering my current project schedule &#40;too busy didn&#39;t even have a winter vacation&#41; i couldn&#39;t do any research on training / lifespan in my game

 With only one adventure it might not have had enough affect to be noticable.  It could be that various things have &#34;points cost&#34; of lifespan and for each 100 points &#40;or whatever&#41;, then a week is taken off of the lifespan. <BR> <BR>I would suggest taking a pixie out several times and hold everything else constant.  The only problem is, that could be a very time consuming test. <BR> <BR>If you ultimately find it does affect lifespan, I would be curious to see if adventures during some stage of life have a worse affect that others.  I&#39;m hoping to do some testing to myself if I can get some spare time... :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Ors

 T3 and T4 were both taken on adventures twice while T1 and T2 were only taken on adventures once. Just incase you can&#39;t get that :P

 Ok I did a little extra research here. I used the same pixies who went on adventures the same week as the first experiment &#40;scroll up&#41; schedule only 2 differences. Instead of getting to the exit and going to the ranch safely. Right when I got into an adventure i quit it  And the monsters had different death dates. Heres the results. <BR> <BR>T3 And T4 Died 9mo4wk <BR>T1,T2,T5 Died 10mo 1wk <BR> <BR>Ok... The monsters both went on adventures yet only the monsters who went on 2 adventures lost life... Meaning.. uh-oh... So maybe Adventures take off less then a week of lifespan per trip... Wonder if this could be true for other factors too... More testing needed.. MUCH more testing needed... and a gameshark... and other good stuff but yah Testing needed.. <BR> <BR>Any Questions, comments, and the likewise?

 You mean it would only take off less than a week of lifespan per failed&#40;by quitting&#41; adventure trip. <BR> <BR>At least that&#39;s what I&#39;m understanding from the results you&#39;ve provided so far.

 No, it could quite possibily mean that doing regular adventures take of lifespan of .49 or less &#40;assuming that the computer rounds lifespan down&#41; On the other experiment I only went on 2 adventures but maybe after 3 adventures you lose lifespan. This could be happening with all the lifespan experiments I have been doing. What is needed is for people to go through and adventure there monsters every other week or something and then tally up how many adventures the monster went on and how much lifespan was lost. I plan to do this in the.. far... future. You could always beat me to it :P

 I start classes tomorrow and I&#39;m finalizing the ingredients needed for a few breeding experiments so it&#39;ll be hard to squeeze in...but i&#39;ll try

 I&#39;m thinking that the lifeloss didn&#39;t come from doing the adventures, but from being _tired_ after them. Remember how much that &#39;tired&#39; bar shoots up when you stop in the middle of an adventure, after all. Or when you fail in general.

 There was 2 weeks rest inbetween the adventures which is more then enough to drop fatigue back to 0 &#40;or whatever.&#41; If that was the case they should have lost 1 week of life per adventure which they didn&#39;t.

 So, if I&#39;m reading this chart correctly, the Phoenixes that had two adventures instead of one or none, died one week earlier than the others. Correct?
