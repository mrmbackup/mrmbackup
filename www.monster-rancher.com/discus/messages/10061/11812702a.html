 Four years and four months of feeding a Henger its favourite food, and it still hated my guts. I&#39;m sure Harrabcat can vouch for me on this one. <BR> <BR>This leaves the the looking into of gadgets, items, battles, and adventures. <BR> <BR>Any comments? Questions? Attempts to say I&#39;m a lying piece of crap?

 You&#39;re monster didn&#39;t dislike Rest did it? :P <BR> <BR>Also, was there anything else that it really didn&#39;t like? I.E. Scolding, or something the reduced its weight? <BR> <BR>Anything else that might have affected these results? &#40;P.S. I&#39;ll double check, not saying you are wrong, but just wondering&#41;

 They disliked &#34;White Pot&#34;, and the rest didn&#39;t cause them to get stressed or anything, so I would presume they were neutral, or liked it. The monsters used were the Hengers &#40;5 of them&#41;, which were rested their entire life. So, no scolding, or anything of the like that might have affected the results.

 Try some praisings on the monsters that you&#39;re raising &#40;sleeping?&#41;. It seems to me that the rhythm of &#39;stick and carrot&#39; helps work with the bonding. I&#39;m surprised that favorite food didn&#39;t help bonding, mind you. I would have thought that would come in under &#39;carrot&#39;. Maybe it&#39;s because they were spoiled the whole way, so like in MR2, the &#39;spoil&#39; overcame the &#39;fear&#39;.

 Well, in MR2, it was 50/50, iirc. So, that would mean that the bar should&#39;ve been at least half full. That&#39;s always a possibilty though.

 You&#39;ve got a point about that. So either bonding doesn&#39;t do anything when the monster&#39;s spoiled &#40;unlikely&#41;, or food, even favorite foods, definitely have nothing to do with it like you said &#40;more likely&#41;. Wonder if items are the same way. So many variables! I think I&#39;ll have to try and split off a save and test.

 Ok. I just finished up a short run of testing with monsters. Five different monsters, five different ways of feeding, no bonding whatsoever. So food alone definitely does nothing for bonding, as Infernus said. I&#39;d show the week-by-week, but let&#39;s face it: &#39;no change&#39; &#39;no change&#39; &#39;no change&#39; would get monotonous after a while. ;&#41;

I used 5 Hengers, Harrabcat used 5 &#40;or was it 10?&#41; Pixies, and 5 Phoenices. Kurasu just stated &#34;five different ways of feeding&#34;, so there&#39;s more proof. 20-25 monsters, a variety of foods, etc. Really, I would&#39;ve shown my data for my 5 Hengers, but as Kurasu said, it would get monotonous posting &#34;no change&#34; after a while. Also, there&#39;s not much point in restating info I&#39;ve already stated, and I said that I used. <BR> <BR>For more information on the details of this statement, see <FONT COLOR="21as49"><I>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 4 Archive &#40;PS2&#41;: Miscellaneous Q&amp;A &#40;Post New Questions Here&#41; : Henger Lifespan Tests</I></FONT> &#40;those are the same Hengers used in this statement&#41;, <FONT COLOR="ff0000"><I>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 4 Archive &#40;PS2&#41;: Research on game mechanics: Pixie Lifespan Tests</I></FONT>, and <FONT COLOR="0000ff"><I> Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 4 Archive &#40;PS2&#41;: Research on game mechanics: Phoenix Lifespan Tests</I></FONT>.

 For detail, I fed one monster his favorite all the way through, one monster his most disliked food, one monster a middle-level food, one monster a huge variety &#40;with the only balance being that I kept him normal&#41; and one a mixture of best and worst foods. No bonding change on any of the five.

 Let&#39;s see, if you kept a pet, doubt you could call it a pet in this case but anyway, and simply fed it, but ignored it other than that &#40;As in the only time it would see you was when you fed it&#41;, would it bond with you? Even if it liked the food?  <BR>At least for me, I don&#39;t think this would be the case... <BR>As for MR4, maybe the fact of Phayne giving them instructions or saying what to do makes the AI emulate a &#39;caring&#39; feeling on the monsters, which would raise the bonding... &#42;shrugs&#42;
