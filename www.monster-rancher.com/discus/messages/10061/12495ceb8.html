 Just a general question to see what has happened in the life of MR4.  Has anybody maxed a monster out in MR4?  Just trying to find out where this game is at after such a long time. <BR> <BR>&#40;Lisa you can delete if this is a waste of space.&#41;

 Many other&#39;s could delete it as well, but It&#39;s not going to be me. It&#39;s a legit question. <BR> <BR>The fact is, we are getting closer. Many ranchers are now 4000 composite capable. Maxxed &#40;note the double x, it&#39;s a rancher thing&#41; is 5994. With lifespans now figured out, as well as combining from a while back, I&#39;m sure that will push it a little more. I can see us making 5000 at some point, but that still leaves us a little short. A lot of us are confident we&#39;re missing something. I know I&#39;m still searching out many items I&#39;m missing, collecting documents, finishing up tournaments. All in hopes something happens when I get them all...also, getting them just because they&#39;re there. <BR> <BR>Simply put: Not yet, but we&#39;re working on it.

 I am still unsure whether it is possible in MR4 to max out ALL 5 of a creature&#39;s stats. Right now, I can max out 3 stats and have decent gains in life &#40;see the thread on breeding methods&#41;. The best we have so far is a Golem with stats totalling around 3900. &#40;And it is probably possible to reach 4000 to 4100, but beyond that...&#41; <BR> <BR>Without life extension and considering that tournaments do not provide gains in stats the effective training time of monsters is around 3 years for those that can live 4 years. This is why iron heart is a very important trait since it helps you to squeeze as much training out of the creature as possible prior to becoming &#34;pretty old&#34; when stat gains diminish considerably.

 Nice typo. You mean all six, not five. I&#39;m surprised you, of all people, has not broken 4000. Especially with a Golem. I&#39;ve actually got my sights set on 4500. It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;d be that hard if I was willing to dish out the cash.

 I&#39;m sure there&#39;s always that point in any MR game where everyone assumes you cannot max every stat. <BR> <BR>And then you brag about being the first with the maxxed monster. :D <BR> <BR>First comes research, then comes ranching methods.  I&#39;m sure the majority who play MR4 are researching right now.

 On considerable reflection, I think Infernus is right, 4500 is achievable. At present though we are working out a method with Speed/Int creatures, so it will be a bit of time before I can do another golem with a focus on really maxxing out the stats.

 here comes some nice little math for you. for a Golem that lives 224 weeks that has the maximum starting values of all stats through combination, you would need to average &#43;22.5 in stat gains, every single week. &#40;5994-&#40;my encyplopedia entry&#41;632&#42;1.5=5046 5046/224=22.526...&#41;.  If you lose lifespan at all or have to rest at all, the value of the average stat gains go up. At this point in time, i cannot see this being accomplished.

Your math is flawed. You can&#39;t just take the total and mulitply it by 1.5. Each stat needs to be done individually. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s assume here. Let&#39;s say you have two Golems, inseperable, something like this:  <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Lif</TD><TD>Pow</TD><TD>Int</TD><TD>Acc</TD><TD>Spd</TD><TD>Def </TD></TR><TR><TD>450</TD><TD>499</TD><TD>425</TD><TD>400</TD><TD>375</TD><TD>475 </TD></TR><TR><TD>450</TD><TD>499</TD><TD>425</TD><TD>400</TD><TD>375</TD><TD>475 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Tot: </TD></TR><TR><TD>900</TD><TD>998</TD><TD>850</TD><TD>800</TD><TD>750</TD><TD>950 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Mid</TD><TD>High</TD><TD>Mid</TD><TD>Low</TD><TD>Low</TD><TD>High </TD></TR><TR><TD>&#42;1.4</TD><TD>&#42;1.5</TD><TD>&#42;1.4</TD><TD>&#42;1.3</TD><TD>&#42;1.3</TD><TD>&#42;1.5</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Base Golem stats are: 110, 170, 80, 65, 50, 150. Therefore, starting stats are: 154, 255, 112, 84, 65, 225. Our Golem with maximum values is not 948 &#40;632 &#42;1.5&#41;, no, it&#39;s 895. Even if I had them in different order, it wouldn&#39;t make a whole lot of difference. I don&#39;t even know how you got 632. Pure Golem, from book, totals to 625. <BR> <BR>So, 5099/224 = 22.76 &#40;22.8&#41; per week. Now let&#39;s get really funky. <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Stage 1</TD><TD> Stage 2</TD><TD> Stage 3</TD><TD> Stage 4</TD><TD> Stage 5 </TD></TR><TR><TD>45</TD><TD>60</TD><TD>60</TD><TD>45</TD><TD>14</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>Numbers are in weeks. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s assume that during stage one you get 11 per drill, stage two gets 27, stage three gets 57, stage four gets 22, and stage five gets 8. <BR> <BR>45&#42;11 = 495 <BR>60&#42;27 = 1620 <BR>60&#42;57 = 3420 <BR>45&#42;22 = 990 <BR>14&#42;8 = 112 <BR>Total: 6637 <BR>Plus the original 895 gives us: 7532 <BR>Excess: 1538 <BR> <BR>Now, this is assuming everything goes absolutely perfect at every stage, that you don&#39;t rest, and that you don&#39;t fight. That&#39;s not going to happen. So let&#39;s steal some weeks from stage three to account for rests and fights up to class S &#40;from C&#41;, that&#39;s 12 fights, and to keep our numbers clean, we&#39;ll give this bad boy 18 rests &#40;which, IMO, is too much&#41;. <BR> <BR>This makes stage three 30&#42;57 = 1710. So we&#39;ve cut it in half. Our new total is 5822. Just out of reach of maxx. But you know what, I actually see this as reasonable. It&#39;d be hell to get every thing perfect like that, but hey, if you have the patience, it&#39;s worth a go. I can see a Golem hitting the 5000-5500 range eventually. <BR> <BR>Does this give us maxx? No. It pushes us closer. This is why I think we&#39;re missing something. If not, then it looks like 5500, a ridiculously hard number to aquire, would be tops. <BR> <BR>Golem was just used as an example because Slappy used it. We have to remember that specials tend to have the uncanny ability to start with much higher stats, that is to say, Gadgeter G might be a top prospect monster, depending on its lifespan.

 I have not seen it on the site but I found this to be a great tool.  <BR> <BR>I am working on formulateing a training method baced on what I have seen in here.   <BR> <BR>I have been giving Oils to my monsters to reduce fatigue.  Stress became an issue early on around week 10 or so.  I am sure this comes as no suprise.  <BR> <BR>Stress makes the monsters not preform well so I started looking at ways to limit stress.  I have been working with the Ants mostly right now.   <BR> <BR>I placed 1 well on the ranch and noticed that the stress came down but not enough.  Items did no good and it seemed that the only thing that did was rest.  So I tried placeing a second well on the ranch to see what happened.  <BR> <BR>The stress of my monsters droped noticebly.  where as the training methond I was useing made them frustrated because of long training times and hard drills and eventually they became Irritated.  A problem with jells back when I trained them.   <BR> <BR>The problem is that It was not enough.  So I bought Special Training devices.  All healing and noticed that they did not get as fatiged as they used to and there stress was lowered even more.  Finialy I decided that I would put three wells on the ranch but I ran out of meatles for my next step. <BR> <BR>For maxing monsters I decided that baced on the math posted above I would need to go out of the box.  When you combine two S class monsters they start as C class.  The higher the class the more or better they do on the ranch training.   <BR> <BR>My Ant who started as E was pitted agains my Ant who started as C.  The C class ant earned on average 3-5 points more on the Sandbag drills.   <BR> <BR>Then I started the hole thing over and from birth I started training my monsters with Lv. 4 Gadgets as they give more as well.  And I have been getting Aswome stat gains.  Oil helps and scolding  and praise. Also with 3 wells my monsters no matter how much I push them never have gotten fatigued yet.  I dont have the healing gadgets for the level 4s because I cant find any more darn meatles.  Grrrrrrr.  <BR> <BR>I scold at 60 or below and praise at 85 or above.   Feeding food they like or dont like accordingly to how they did. <BR> <BR>Any how the point comes down to if you have healing gadgets, 3 wells, the gadgets are Lv 4, and just keep them going as long as you can from birth you can get a really high monster.   <BR> <BR>I dont know if it will Max yet but I am working on it right now.  Sorry I dont have the figures you guys like to use but I started to noticed this all on the fly.  I have to wait till my  current monsters go as far as they can go before I can get my next set for number crunching.

Sweet. And here all I can do is max out a monster with Lv. 2 Magic gadgets/Wind Drums and enough Oily Oils and Shimp/Pork/Golden Peaches &#40;the secret max-out item you&#39;ve all been wasting your time ignoring. It&#39;s the hidden link which makes maxing my monsters out possible, and I won&#39;t tell how to get it! :P&#41; to make any Deathwing &#40;Phoenix/Unknown&#41; or Mushtan &#40;Plant/Unknown&#41;cringe. Oh, and those are the two monsters which are maxable&#40;besides the un-cd-generatable-class-E super-PWNage-Garu which you recieve at the VERY beginning of the game or a tri fused Dark Antlan &#41; So back to my Deathwing and Mushtan &#40;which I used to mock because of it&#39;s starting weakness&#41; they can PWN anyone. Takes a lot of work and making then go without rest for half-a-year once they hit their &#34;PWNAGE is becoming vey mature&#34; prime &#40;once again, Golden Peach&#39;s effect makes that possible, and it&#39;s worth million G!&#41; I can easily get at least a couple thousand points in without worrying about focus, tiredness, hunger, injury/sickness, or stress &#40;IMO, the ultimate maxximum stat dream crusher; it&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t pull it off w/o my uber fruit&#41;. Indeed, I am teh best. See ya! &#42;yamyamkissykiss&#42; <BR> <BR>&#40;P.S. If one &#34;G&#34; ish a thousand buckaroos, then isn&#39;t a million &#34;G&#34;s actually a billion dollars? And should ANY item really cost that much? Why can&#39;t I buy sum new land? I want Diehl&#39;s Mansion. I will go back to my Action Replay Pro and somehow make the im-frickin&#39;-possible, well, possible. AGAIN INFERNUS!&#40;Do I get to be Cheetah?&#41;To Lisa: Please erase this if this takes up too much space. Hate to drive costs up!&#41;

 Heh, just kidding! Although I did manage to max a Mushtan and combo Deathwing, I lied about the special effect of the Peach. It only severely dampers those qualities for a few months &#40;I said it completely eliminated them&#41;. Look in Torble during spring at the University&#40;it&#39;s the least I could do to make it up to you.&#41; Chances are VERY slim, but just maybe... Sowwy! :&#39;&#40;

 I&#39;m going to need proof of this so called maxing? I&#39;d like to know a few things...  <BR> <BR>Mushtan&#39;s generation/ starting stats and length it lived.  <BR> <BR>Heck, you could serve up some big crow if you presented a sharkport save.

You do realise that the Moderators can see who is posting as Anonymous? You also realise that talking about items without proof of their existence, and making claims of doing things no one else has while saying you will not demonstrate how is grounds for being banned from the site? <BR> <BR>You have made the claims.
