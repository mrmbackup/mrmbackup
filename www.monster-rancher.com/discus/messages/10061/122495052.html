We seriously need to get these done, and with the ability to do 5 at once, it should be THAT hard. <BR> <BR>Anyway, just some simple guidlines: <BR>1: Make sure they are born on week 1 of any given month <BR>2: Feed them on week 4. When they get fat/chubby, feed on week 2 and 4. You should use the more standard foods, i.e carrots, potatos, mangos. <BR>3: Rest all their lives <BR>4: Record all stages &#40;you&#39;ll know by the statements&#41;. Record the week you are going to in the age. So, if you get the message as you are entering week 4, and your monster is 10 months old, the age for stage 2 is 10mo4wk. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll be posting later today most likely, so it should be more clear as to what you are supposed to do. I am currently working on Durahan, Beaklon, Dragon, Baku, and Ducken. As far as I know, Dark Palidan may be doing Golem, Zuum, Mew, Hare, and Tiger. <BR> <BR>Remember, you can do 1 monster at a time and still train 4... <BR> <BR><B>Pures only</B>...for now. Post what you are doing before you start...

All ranchers read! <BR> <BR>You have five slots for monsters! Start one! Or two! If ten of you do two, that&#39;s <I>thirty</I> breeds done &#40;including PT&#39;s Antlan and my latest project&#41;!

I declare the one&#39;s DP said he would do open.

I&#39;ve updated the list to an extreme extent. Thanks to Krysis Adelis, we have the sub-breed formula. Once Ripper, Ogyo, Madillo, Naga, Garu, Zan, Jell, and the three Apes are up, this project is complete &#40;with the exception of specials&#41;. Beautiful. <BR> <BR>Ripper and the three Apes are the ones not being worked on right now. I plan to start them eventually, but am pre-occupied atm.

 Iron_Datu, something is wrong with Jell. Stage four and five read the same. Please correct this. <BR> <BR>I hope to begin the Apes this week, as well as two undecided rares. <BR> <BR>Oh, and, updated.

 I thought since they are not done or completed I could do Ogyo and Ripper. At least they are not in the chart. Please correct me if I am wrong about this.

 I have a question about the lifespans for sub-breeds. In the FAQ-&#62;Lifespans it states &#34;For monsters with sub breeds, the lifespan formula is Main&#43;Main&#43;Sub=#, then #/3&#34;. Where is the Sub number supplied? For instance, if I raise a durahan/dragon, lifespan would be 216 weeks &#43; 196 weeks &#43; ??? = magic number, then divide magic number by 3 to get total life span. I&#39;m a bit confused, is it something that I&#39;m completely missing? Thanks

 Sub is shorthand for sub-breed, in this case Dragon is your sub. Your main is Durahan.

 If you do it, I thank you. Just make sure you do it the same as everyone else. <BR> <BR>There will be at least 5 new ones up this weekend. &#40;Ogyo, Ripper, Gadgeter G, ChaosDragon, and Dino&#41;.

 Hello, I thought I would try to help fill in a few holes in the FAQ lifespan section. <BR> <BR>Ogyo <BR>Stage 2:    10m 4w <BR>Stage 3: 2y  1m 1w <BR>Stage 4: 3y  3m 2w <BR>Stage 5: 4y  2m 1w <BR>End:     4y  5m 3w <BR> <BR>Ripper <BR>Stage 2:    10m 1w <BR>Stage 3: 1y 11m 1w <BR>Stage 4: 3y  0m 1w <BR>Stage 5: 3y  9m 4w <BR>End:     4y  1m 1w <BR> <BR>RedShortsApe <BR>Stage 2:    10m 4w <BR>Stage 3: 2y  0m 4w <BR>Stage 4: 3y  2m 4w <BR>Stage 5: 4y  1m 2w <BR>End:     4y  4m 3w <BR> <BR>Joker &#40;the error control&#41; <BR>Stage 2:     8m 1w <BR>Stage 3: 1y  6m 3w <BR>Stage 4: 2y  5m 2w <BR>Stage 5: 3y  1m 1w <BR>End:     3y  3m 4w <BR> <BR>The joker&#39;s life matched previous findings. <BR> <BR>In the 4&#43; years of resting I managed to finish getting all 4 of the &#34;girl friends.&#34; <BR> <BR>Yuri in Togle <BR>Readme in Ryuwn <BR>Chiho in Torble <BR>Laurier in Vizley <BR> <BR>Just as posted I got them in that order by spending every available weekend visiting and talking to them.  Their apearance changed and so did their responces when you talk to them &#40;although only slightly&#41;.  It should be noted that my breeder fame is not 100 everywhere so it is safe to say fame is not a factor. <BR> <BR>Also of note: <BR>I &#34;trained&#34; &#40;more like rested&#41; all four of the monsters together with no gadgets or affects on the ranch, and at the same starting time. <BR> <BR>I only fed them mushrooms when all four reached &#34;OK&#34; &#40;instead of &#34;lively&#34;&#41;.  This is about 4 weeks of no feeding followed by one week of food.  They all stayed Normal Form until 3 years at which point all four became &#34;Chubby&#34; the next time I fed them I fed all four vitamins instead of mushrooms.  Then they were all normal and I fed them mushrooms just as before.  At 4y and 2m the two remaining monsters &#40;Ape and Ogyo&#41; became chubby and I fed them vitamins a second and final time.  This didn&#39;t have any affect on the Jokers life and I only spent about $6,000 on food this way.  They spent nearly their entire lives Normal form and Lenient. <BR> <BR>I also watched their friendships which were all &#34;Great friends&#34; by 2y 0m 2w but never became &#34;Best friends&#34;.  The joker and ripper who were both &#34;Cool&#34; monsters always became the next level of friends before the others joined them. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps and the lifespan table gets completed!
