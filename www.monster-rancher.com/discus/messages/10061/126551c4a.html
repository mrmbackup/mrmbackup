 I&#39;ve been feeling that this version of MR implements the Counter system to offset the ol Speed vs Defence imbalance inthe others. It used to be pretty much possible to get away with 100 defence and 999 speed. Nowadays, I&#39;m more inclined to 999 defence and 100 speed. <BR> <BR>Plus, I&#39;m also trying to raise power/ intel before I mess about with my accuracy. mmm. <BR> <BR>My idea is that if you&#39;re counter happy, that means you have a minimum accuracy of 33%, and against counter happy opponents, a max accuracy of 67%. <BR> <BR>Now, does anyone know how damage is calculated for counters? Does it use Pow or Intel, and for which monster? <BR> <BR>Plus, I&#39;ve noticed that my counter damage can vary WILDLY. I was bringing some weak &#40;about 1500 composite&#41; monsters into Volcano&#43; adventures, and against one particular S monster, I performed counter hits with my golem with damage ranging from 40 to 130 or so. What The Hey??? &#40;I get 2-3 counters a fight is about average. This fight had about 5...&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Also... for those tag comps and adventuring, I was thinking that having a weak but accurate monster &#34;set up&#34; the hit for a monstrously strong but innacurate monster would be good. Seems reasonable, when they&#39;ve got high friendship, since the partner&#39;s hit has 100% accuracy. mmm. <BR> <BR>Problem with this is I&#39;m not sure what determines the damage of the combo attack. Intel or power? Or does it depend on the attack? <BR> <BR>I notice that my dragon sometimes uses his claw, and sometimes uses fire as his &#34;tag&#34; attack. I think he uses fire to combo into mid range attacks, but I&#39;m not certain about this. mmm.

 For counters, for damage and withering effect, it uses the skill the opponent was using. But I think they use your best stat between int and pow to decide damage, but I&#39;m not sure about that.

 mmm... so, a counter, despite it&#39;s uppercut animation for a lot of charaters, is actually more of a &#34;reflect&#34; skill? <BR> <BR>hmmm... hmmm... HMMM!!! <BR> <BR>OK!!! Now I&#39;m gonna try raising some PURE defense monsters. Who have NOTHING but defense training early on, first thing to reach is 999. Then I&#39;m gonna see if they do any damage to people they hit or not... <BR> <BR>If my suspicions are correct... The attacks might your opponent&#39;s own Pow/Intel for that attack as well. <BR> <BR>Anyone else been experimenting with counters can confirm this for me?
