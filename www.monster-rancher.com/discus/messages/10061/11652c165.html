Well I noticed a lot of people are still trying figure this game out. And here I&#39;m going to do my part by posting a guide to breeding for new monsters <BR> <BR>The rules are very straightforward and simple. First thing you have to understand is not every main breed has all the other main breeds as sub breeds. For example, you cannot breed a zuum with a pixie and expect to get a zuum/pixie because that combination doesn’t even exist. You could however breed a zuum with a dragon to get a zuum/dragon &#40;salamander.&#41; The reason the zuum/dragon works is because it’s a pre-programmed monster already in the game. YOU CANNOT MAKE MONSTERS THAT DO NOT EXIST!!! <BR> <BR>If you have one of every main breed it is possible to get every single monster combination besides the rare using these techniques. <BR> <BR>First off any main breed &#40;A&#41; combined with another main breed &#40;B&#41; can make either of the original monsters. For example a Suezo combined with a pixie will still have the option to regenerate either the pixie or the suezo. <BR> <BR>Any Main breed &#40;A&#41; combined with another main breed &#40;B&#41; can make the Combination of those 2 monsters &#40;Main Breed A/Main Breed B&#41; AS LONG AS THE MONSTER EXISTS. For example lets again use the Suezo combined with a pixie. In this instance you can either make a Suezo/Pixie &#40;Pink Eye&#41; Or a Pixie/Suezo &#40;Sueko&#41; <BR> <BR>You CANNOT take 2 monsters sub breeds and combine them. For example you cannot combine an Aero &#40;Pixie/Tiger&#41; with a Daina &#40;Pixie/Dragon&#41; and Expect to get a Crevasse&#41;. <BR> <BR>In Order to get the pure breed of the monster you must have combine 2 monsters of that main breed. For example you can breed an Aero &#40;Pixie/Tiger&#41; with a Daina &#40;Pixie/Dragon&#41; To get a Pixie &#40;Pixie/Pixie.&#41; You cannot however breed 2 Faerilina’s &#40;Pixie/Ripper&#41; and get a pure pixie. <BR> <BR>Let me show you how you can put this all to good use. Lets say you have shrined all your cd’s and only found a single pixie. Lets say this pixie was an Aero. Lets also say you have one of every other main breed. Here&#39;s how you could combine to get all the non-rare pixies. <BR> <BR>First off you could shrine that Aero &#40;Pixie/Tiger&#41; <BR>Then combine it with a dragon to get a Daina &#40;Pixie/Dragon&#41; <BR>You can then shrine another Aero and combine that Aero With Daina to get Pixie &#40;Pixie/Pixie&#41;  <BR>You could then take that Pixie and Combine it with a Naga to get an Allure &#40;Pixie/Naga&#41;  <BR>You could then take that Allure and combine it with a Ducken to get a Mischief &#40;Pixie/Ducken&#41; <BR>You could then combine that Mischief With a Joker and get a Lilim &#40;Pixie/Joker&#41;  <BR>You could then Combine that Lilim with a Durahan and get a Janne &#40;Pixie/Durahan&#41;  <BR>You could then Combine Janne with Lesione to get an Undine &#40;Pixie/Lesione&#41;  <BR>You could then combine that Undine with an Ogyo and get a PinkPrincess &#40;Pixie/Ogyo&#41;  <BR>You could then combine the PinkPrincess with a Suezo to get a Sueko &#40;Pixie/Suezo&#41;  <BR>You could then Combine that Sueko with a Ripper to get a Faerilina &#40;Pixie/Ripper&#41;and then you have all your pixies ready to be shrined. <BR> <BR>I hope this helps everybody. Sorry about the horrible grammar. Happy Ranching
