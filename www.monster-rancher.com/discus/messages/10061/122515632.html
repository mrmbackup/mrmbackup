To contribute, see Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 4 Archive &#40;PS2&#41;: Miscellaneous Q&amp;A &#40;Post New Questions Here&#41; : Temporary Thread for Documents <BR> <BR><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#996600">History</FONT></CENTER> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Title</TD><TD>Page 1</TD><TD>Page 2</TD><TD>Page 3</TD><TD>Page 4 </TD></TR><TR><TD>3 Ancient Deities</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The 3 famous gods&#44;Fleria&#44;Gadamon&#44;and Bragma are worshipped by people across the land. Images are found in shrines everywhere.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">But there is a little-known fact about two of these gods: Gaderman and Phrelia.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">When these two were young&#44; they bickered about everything&#44; and caused people around them much trouble.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Ancient Technology</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Legend has it that in ancient times people used special methods to strengthen monsters.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">But the technology used was greatly harmful to the minds and bodies of the monsters - eventually causing them to go mad.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">This created a series of tragedies&#44; until finally the technology itself was sealed away for good.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Cox&#39;s File 1</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">A long time ago&#44;the people in charge of monster training and regeneration were called Tochika.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Fleria and Gadamon&#44;who appear in the myths&#44;were probably two of the Tochika. =P.J. Cox=</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Cox&#39;s File 2</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Eventually&#44; the Tochika shared their monster training skills with the general population</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">For this they were revered by many people&#44; and this likely explains why they were worshipped as deities in late generations. =P.J. Cox=</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Cox&#39;s File 3</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">There is a blank period of history in this world. It is the period between when the Tochicka spread their monster knowledge&#44;</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">and today&#39;s age. During this period&#44; the technology for regenerating monsters from Saucer Stones&#44; as well as the monster themselves&#44;</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">where lost. But nobody know why.=P.J. Cox=</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Cox&#39;s File 4</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The Ruins of Promiass. Perhaps some secret lies here?</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The descendants of the Tochika live here. But it is not clear whether that is a mere coincidence&#44;or holds some kind of significance. =P.J. Cox=</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Cox&#39;s File 5</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Kawrea Volcano: This special location is believed to be the location whre the Phoenix dies and is reborn.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Legend has it that long ago&#44; the Phoenix fought an evil beast&#44; saving the world. The Phoenix is a special type of monster.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">No matter who or what tries to stop the flutter of the Phoenix&#39;s wings&#44;it will always continue flying. =P.J. Cox=</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>The Tochikan Shrine</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">According to myth&#44; the shrine used by the Tochika floated in the skies. A single&#44; long road leading to the shrine extended down to the earth surface.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Two theories exist about the fate of the shrine: One&#44; that it lost its power to float in the skies&#44; and fell to the earth.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Two&#44; that it still floats in the sky somewhere.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">One theory argues that the ruins in Sektova are the remains of the Tochikan Shrine&#44; but this is unconfirmed.</FONT>  </TD></TR><TR><TD>Ancient Stone</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The fragments of a stone laced with a mysterious power are scattered across the world.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Legend has it that if the pieces are collected together&#44; the lost power of the ancients will be revived. Many a soul has searched the world for these fragments.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">But&#44; even those who collected the fragments failed to gain the power.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Thus it is said: &#34;The stone shall choose its owner&#44; and only the chosen one shall gain its power.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Spark Flute</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The fiery Lord of the Skies&#44; whose eyes spark with wisdom&#44; &amp; whose wings contain the power of fire.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Only the one who is pur of heart shall be blessed by the Lord&#39;s power.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Healing Child</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">That land dweller&#44; whose happiness was left for another age. The adorable one whose voice soothes all.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Who brings the hearts of human and beast together in harmonyThe one who is human&#44; but not human.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR><CENTER>Monster</CENTER> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Title</TD><TD>Page 1</TD><TD>Page 2</TD><TD>Page 3</TD><TD>Page 4</TD><TD> Page 5 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Monster Mysteries</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The regeneration of monsters is a recent phenomenon&#44; but monsters themselves have existed from long ago.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">However&#44; nobody knows why they were sealed in Saucer Stones&#44; or when they dissapeared.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Ancient Monsters</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">People say that the evolution of monsters in ancient times was different to that of monsters today. In the past&#44; it is said that monsters exhibited various</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">patterns of evolution depending on the characteristics of their local surroundings. This is a trait not found in monsters after that period.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>&#91;Origins&#93;</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Monsters that appear the same sometimes take slightly different forms&#44; depending on their area of origin.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">For example&#44; take a Tsunomaru&#44; a monster born from the combination of a Suezo and Tiger. Depending on where the Saucer Stone was found&#44; and other</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">differences leading up to it&#39;s birth&#44; the Tsunomaru may be born with or without horns.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">It is not known whether this is a factor determined by regional differences&#44; or by a difference in the Saucer Stone itself.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>About the Ducken</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The Ducken is considered one of the most mysterious monsters of ancient civilization. Little is known about its creation.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Ancient people&#44; at one point&#44; became unable to create the Ducken&#44; and had to rely on regeneration from Saucer Stones.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">As a result&#44; details about the Ducken&#44; such as where&#44; when&#44; or why it was created are not known.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Some theories say that is was merely a toy create by ancient people</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">other theories argue that it was a doll that became imbued with a mystical power&#44; like the Mew.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>About the Mocchi</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The Mocchi are loved by all. It is no secret that Mocchi are enormously popular - there are few who can resist falling in love with these soft&#44; adorable creatures.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">In ancient times&#44; Mocchis were seen as pets. Many records show Mocchi living happily along side humans.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>About the Suezo</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Since ancient times&#44; people have had trouble raising the moody Suezo.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">There are tales of Suezo skipping training&#44; or being put in charge of the shop&#44; only to eat the items.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Of course&#44; most people are not silly enough to put Suezo in charge of a shop in the first place.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>About the Henger</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The henger is vivid evidence of the advanced technology of ancient civilization.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">It appears that numerous attempts were needed to create the henger. What is thought to be a Henger prototype was discovered in a Saucer Stone.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">It is thought that Hengers did not exist on Aeage Island&#44; but they were discovered there recently&#44; contradicting the former assumptions.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">This discovery suggests that Henger were used in areas all around the world in ancient times.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>About the Golem</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">There are records of Golems going back to the age of myths. Humans have been familiar with the Golems for a long time.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Even in the myths they are knowns as good-natured monsters&#44; usually depicted as strong monsters with kind hearts.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Sadly&#44; due to their good nature&#44; they usually only play sideline roles in the stories. Of course&#44; I supposed that&#44; too&#44; is fitting of the Golem though.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>About the Pixie</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Cute&#44; but fickle. Lovable&#44; but bratty. Perhaps this description reminds you of the trickiest of monsters&#44; the Pixies.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">In every age&#44; there have been breeders who were tricked by the mischievous Pixies.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">In some rare cases&#44; with the most beautiful Pixies&#44; wars were waged with them as the cause.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">We are unlikely to see any more such wars&#44; but there have always been breeders raising pixies. And we will likely see more for generations eternal.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#663300">Land</FONT>/<FONT COLOR="#3300FF">Climate</FONT></CENTER> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Title</TD><TD>Page 1</TD><TD>Page 2</TD><TD>Page 3</TD><TD>Page 4</TD><TD>Page 5 </TD></TR><TR><TD>The Elives School</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">A number of years back FIMBA and IMa worked in cooperation to create a breeder school called Elives School.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The school attracted talented young boys and girls&#44; who&#44; after graduation&#44; joined one of the two groups&#44; FIMBA or IMa starting with official Breeder Rank E.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Vizley&#39;s Monster</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Vizley is known for its long monster lifespan. Currently&#44; people are investigating whether this is because of the warm and comfortable climate&#44;</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">or a result of generating a monster in this town.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Regarding FIMBA</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">FIMBA is the oldest existing organization. This group is dedicated to monster culture.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Most of the famous breeders we know belong to FIMBA. But in recent years&#44; IMa&#44; through the use of Training Gadgets&#44;</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">has excelled in strenghtening monsters for monster battles. This has resulted in a monster strenght gap between this group and others.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">As a result&#44; many young breeders prefer to join IMa over FIMBA.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Regarding AGIMA</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">AGIMA is the most recently formed organization. Perhaps because of this&#44; AGIMA is the most experimental of the groups.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">AGIMA makes the most use of the newest technologies.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Furthermore&#44; they are well known for having more advanced medical monster technology than other groups.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>The Kalaragi Mango</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">A fruit called the Kalaragi mango can be found in the Kalaragi Jungle. This fruit was loved and sought after by people in ancient times.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">There is a legend that the goddess Fleria ate a mango off the ground that made her sick&#44; and for this reason she developed a distaste for them.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Modern Jungles</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The two most well know jungles in the world are the Kalaragi and Pare-Pare jungles.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Pare-Pare jungle&#44; a resort area&#44; is close to the sea. The exploration tours conducted there allow people to feel like real - life adventurers.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">In recent years&#44; the discovery of numerous artifacts of an ancient culture in the Kalaragi Jungle has surprised academics.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">However&#44; these investigations have been monopolized by FIMBA&#44; creating stir among competing organizations.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>The Lost Peach</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">A fruit called the Golden Peach once grew in Pare-Pare&#44; but in recent years&#44; after the discovery of their usefulness for monster raising&#44;</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Golden Peaches have become over-harvested. It was always a rare fruit&#44; and now it is so much that few have set eyes upon one.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Now&#44; you can&#39;t get a Golden Peach even if you need one. They are found in the ruins beyond Rune&#44; but now there are so many ill-mannered breeders there&#44;</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">no one can no longer visit the area for practice. Sometimes in Torble you can find it at the auction&#44;</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">but they fetch a pretty penny - the money needed to buy one Golden Peach could buy you 2 or 3 ranches.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR><CENTER>Other</CENTER> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Title</TD><TD>Page 1</TD><TD>Page 2</TD><TD>Page 3</TD><TD>Page 4</TD><TD>Page 5 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Training Gadgets</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Use of Training Gadgets has become popular in recent years&#44; especially in Torble. Originally&#44; they were devices used in ancient civilization&#44;</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">but with the successful decoding of ancient Training Gadget blueprints at Torble University&#44; these devices have been recovered.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">With the help of Training Gadgets&#44; it has become unnecessary to send monsters to far training grounds.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">But on the down side&#44; some caution that the use of Training Gadgets in place of direct attention has led to a decrease in monsters&#39; bond with their breeders.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Monster&#39;s Love</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">There are ancient legends throughout the world referring to a forbidden bond between humans and monsters.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Sadly&#44; in most cases&#44; however&#44; no good came of this bond. The most common story tells of people being tricked by a Pixie out of their entire fortune.</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Breeders should always take care when dealing with such monsters.</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>A Dark Curse</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">The lost wisdom of yore! Get the mysterious object to master the fabled techniques!</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Why was it discarded? Why was it left behind? I bestow upon you the arts of yore.
