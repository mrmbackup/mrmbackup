 It&#39;s a Zuum rare, Zuum/?, so it&#39;s really just a Zuum sub-type, but they took the time to make it look like a 3D rendered version of the MR1 Dino. It has the smooth/rounded &#40;no spikes or frills&#41; head, the darker scales on the top of the head/neck/back/tail, the larger/heavier body of a Dino. I know it&#39;s not as exciting as having a whole main breed of Dinos, but I hope it pleases some fans. <BR> <BR>BTW, I suggested this monster &#40;a Dino as a Zuum rare&#41; to Tecmo Japan directly in a teleconference call in late 2001. It was right around the time that MR1 was about to have its 5th anniversary, and I pointed out that fans who played the original deserved to get something extra for sticking with the series for so long.

 I want to get a dino &#42;sobs&#42; but i don&#39;t have monster farm 1 :P as for monster farm 3 haven&#39;t tested it yet again since my friend in tokyo borrowed my game last week :P will be able to test it next week :P  <BR> <BR>&#42;another spoiler&#42;  <BR>don&#39;t u notice that you can&#39;t get any mocchi from any of your CDs yet. If you try it would be locked. A reason for this is that you need to finish a storyline before you could unlock them :&#41; in one of my CDs I was hoping to get a rare but upon finishing the mocchi storyline all I got was a Gelatine :D

 Yeah, so far I the only monster I have found twice is pure Joker.  <BR>Today I shrined: <BR>Suezo/Zan <BR>Suezo/Hare <BR>Mogi/Suzurin &#40;a girl dog with brown hair and a flower on top of the cap&#41; <BR>Plant/CP &#40;odd&#41; <BR>Hare/CP &#40;odd, just odd&#41; <BR>Garu/Naga &#40;very dark and cool looking&#41; <BR>Beaclon/Ducken <BR> <BR>The Beaclon/Ducken is pretty wild. It&#39;s still an incredibly weird monster, for those who have played MR2. But, this time, in addition to having the wind-up key on its back, it has a clear cover over the back which lets you sort of see a bunch of gears working inside. Very detailed animation on this one. <BR> <BR>So far, CP subs are the oddest/dumbest looking monsters....

 Wait a second...how did you get Jokers, Lisa?  Do you have to unlock them or are they available from the start? <BR> <BR>This game info keeps me impressed as you two &#91;Lisa and Raist&#93; find stuff out.  Keep up the good work.  I appreciate it so much :&#41; <BR> <BR>Is there any word on the Ape Escape Monkey&#39;s availability in Mf4/Mr4 by means if gamers can use them &#40;if there are more Monkeys which I doubt it&#41; from the get go?  I forgot if it was already covered since I am behind with my MR info :P

I just shrined some more tonight. The most notable being: <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>Mew/Baku: looks like Lambchop, very cute <BR> <BR>Zuum/Psiroller: psiroller colored with a few stripes, some make a necktie, it has a tricertops beak-type mouth, a two horns on its nose &#40;one big and a tiny one behind it&#41;, and a three-horned frill at the back of its head. It&#39;s a cool fantasy dinosaur! <BR> <BR>Naga/Plant: Head like a Venus Flytrap, including the flat mouth and tentacle teeth. No eyes. Yes, no eyes. Has a flowery ruffle at the base of the neck, some small spikes on the tail, and a mostly green color scheme. This is one of the weirdest monsters I have ever seen. <BR> <BR>Jell/Joker: It&#39;s just grey wisps like smoke, as if all that existed were the thin strips of color on a normal jell. It has the ball heart. In view mode, when you make it run, it makes itself into a figure like a chicken with bicycle wheels. An homage to the Doodle perhaps.... <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post a longer list of everything I have so far, tomorrow. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>ok, ok, it&#39;s Nya in Japanese....
