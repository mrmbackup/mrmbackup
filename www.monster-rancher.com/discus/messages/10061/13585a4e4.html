 Backstory: I had sold this game to Gamestop about 2 years ago, and just this year I wanted to start ranching again. Anyways since this game has been discontinued, my friend bought it for my birthday. <BR> <BR>Anyways...I totally forgot everything about how to ranch, I even forgot how monsters learn attack techs &#40;but I remember now, adventures&#41; :-&#40; and I was flipping through the manual and saw something very interesting... <BR> <BR>On page 10 there&#39;s the monster data page, and I noticed that all the levels for the Mocchi in that page are above level 25...that wasn&#39;t surprising...until I noticed that it was at 1 year and 8 months! The fatigue bar was 3/4 of the way full and the status for the Mocchi was &#34;OK&#34;. <BR> <BR>So I was just wondering, is this justdevelopers put in something impossible in a gamescreen or is there an actual way of getting a monster with 500 in each stat BEFORE it turns 2 &#40;no drugs&#41;?  <BR> <BR>If there is I&#39;d like to know a way :-D and are ALL training gadgets found in Kalagari and Kalagari&#43;?

 I&#39;m just guessing, but this might be the result of strong parent combination. The parents of that particular mocchi were probably really strong, as well with their parents, and their parents, and so on, and so on. I have tried this, and one of my monsters had his pow. lif. ski. and def. over 500. And no, you don&#39;t only get training gadgets from Kalaragi and Kalaragi&#43;. I have gotten a &#34;Rodeo&#34; from Togle caves.

 Ah...cool cool, just checking if this panned out because I was thinking how could such a monster at D rank have a loss &#40;which it did according to the manual&#41;, but it had near S monster stats at such a young age! <BR> <BR>That could only be so via forfeit or something...FORFEIT!!!

 Also it shows his adventure lvl, an impossible lvl 21 =&#41;. Also any adventure that gives gold tablets can give all training gadgets so I think ruins,volcano,and any &#43;.

 Oh yeah, level 21, but he doesn&#39;t have all the battle skills for Mocchi yet &#40;according to a few pages after&#41;...if that is the same Mocchi. And thanks so much for helping me finding gadgets, unfortunately I can&#39;t find any...yet &#40;mostly items and drugs&#41;.

 Your welcome and to help you out, the best places i&#39;ve found gold tablets is 8F of the volcano and promiass&#43; 10-11F. Theres 1 map out of 3 i&#39;ve searched on the 8F that has about 4 caves you can search, I&#39;ve found 2 gold tablets there.For promiass just search every dirt/cave/high.

 Ah I see...when you say volcano do you mean &#43; as well? Because I basically just retired my old monsters and am now using young monsters who can&#39;t adventure higher than regular volcano. <BR> <BR>Also did any of your monsters have lucky star?

 I was just meaning the regular volcano and lucky star is a must in my opinion. If you have him, Gu Yan Duck &#40;I think thats how its spelled&#41; would be perfect as he starts with lucky star as a trait and since he&#39;s a ducken, learns every search. You might want to bring a monster who has flight ride, that way you can take shortcuts and save time and energy just flying over boulders.

 Ah...I have a Dark Cell &#40;Jell/Joker&#41; that has all search abilities and lucky star, and you&#39;re saying that you got TWO gold tablets on the 8th floor? Throughout the entire adventure all I got were four silver tabs which I already invented. Also Promiass mostly gave me medals and devices I already had &#40;no silvers or gold tabs either&#41;. <BR> <BR>Oh well it really is all luck...also what combination of effect devices do you use for max performance? I&#39;d just like to know if I ever get these devices.

 Theres a certain 8F you can get that has about 4 caves and a few high searchs and yes it&#39;s all luck, just keep trying you&#39;ll get it.I use magic Lv2&#39;s but since I recently got a Wind drum with a Gadma statue &#40;with which I can get 100% most all the time, making magic&#39;s useless&#41;,i&#39;m trading them in for Helaing Lv2&#39;s, to releive some stress. So it really just depends on your ranch.
