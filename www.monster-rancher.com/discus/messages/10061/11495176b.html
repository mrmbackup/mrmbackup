 Your absolutely correct endless.. and since i already found out what i wanted to find out theres no reason to post the other 2 on the other hand i did find out that Some monsters learn some traits sometime in their lifetime .. you just don&#39;t know when.. hardscale is an example using my pixie experiment. i had another pixie/dragon who i just took on adventure he learned hard scale just like this one but he learned it at an earlier lvl.. and also even if monsters are from the same disc they don&#39;t nessecairily learn the same traits in the same order &#40;this has been posted somewhere i think but here it is again&#41;

 I&#39;d like to point out that Aero and Faerilina have somersault as a starting skill as Daina starts off with WindyLance which is probably the reason why they didn&#39;t learn it twice when the other breeds did.

 I&#39;ve been doing some experimentation myself with this. <BR>As far as I can tell, monsters basically just have a set list of skills/traits they WILL get. But it would appear to be random WHEN they actually get them. <BR>I took a Durahan/Antlan, Garu/Garu and Pixie/Joker on Adventures 10 times. Each time I brought them from level 1 to level 10. One or two would pass 10, but I kept track of all changes up to that level. <BR>Basically, they all generally got the same abilities, though each time they got them in a different order. There were the odd ability they only got once, but I figure that&#39;s cause I only went up to 10. If I&#39;d gone to 20, I&#39;d probably be able to get the complete skill/trait list for them.

 I&#39;ve raised a Zan to Adventure level 20 and a Saga &#40;Zan/Naga&#41; to level 18. <BR> <BR>The Zan learned Hi Technic at level 18, and Hi Pow at level 20.  <BR> <BR>The Saga on the other hand, learned &#39;popular&#39; at level 18, which the Zan never learned, and has yet to learn either of the &#34;Hi&#34; traits. It&#39;s possible it&#39;ll learn them in the last two levels, but I don&#39;t know for sure. I&#39;ll test it later and get back with the info.

 Saga Lvl 19: Nothing <BR>Saga Lvl 20: Iron Heart <BR> <BR>Again, the original Zan never learned Iron Heart, meanwhile, the Saga never learned either Hi Pow OR Hi Technic. <BR> <BR>I believe a main breed will have a set of traits that it WILL learn at a random level &#40;ie, all pixies learn pheromone, all tigers learn strong horn&#41; outside of the adventure traits, and then there exists a second, non-descriminant list from which a monster may learn traits at higher leavels composed of increasingly rare and beneficial abilities. <BR> <BR>The Zan learned 2 &#34;Hi&#34; traits &#40;power, accuracy&#41; starting at Lvl 18, a Lilim learned 3 &#40;speed, life, accuracy&#41; starting at Lvl 16, and every other monster I&#39;ve raised has never seen one, including the maxed level Saga mentioned above. <BR> <BR>Just a guess, but I&#39;m assuming these &#34;rare&#34; traits become available from level 15. Of course I have no hard proof to support this, only theories.

 I haven&#39;t got enough monsters to make really good proof, but I can help correlate some of the above. I raised two Mushtans side by side to be able to check for food consumption.  <BR> <BR>Mushtan #1 presently has Hi Sence, Magic Lore, Sniper, Dirt Search, High Search, Genius, Wind Lore, and Lucky Star. It got rid of Pheromone for Foresee, and then got rid of Foresee for Hi Sence. It&#39;s at adventure level 16. <BR> <BR>Mushtan #2 has Pheromone, Magic Lore, Sniper, Dirt Search, High Search, Earth Lore, Foresee, and Eagle Eyes. It&#39;s had a couple lores dropped, as well as Machismo. It&#39;s at adventure level 15. <BR> <BR>Mushtan #2 hasn&#39;t had Lucky Star offered at all. Mushtan #2 has also not had Hi Sence or Genius offered. On the other hand, Mushtan #1 wasn&#39;t offered Eagle Eye or Machismo, where Mushtan #2 was. #2 is one level down from #1, so it may yet get a chance at High Sence, but I&#39;d have to raise it another adventure level to see. <BR> <BR>Clearly, they&#39;re getting different traits at different times. Someone will need to raise two exactly identical monsters to get the actual levels involved. That way, we know that the numbers weren&#39;t &#39;tainted&#39; by a sub-breed. <BR> <BR>Once I have space on my ranch for two monsters, I&#39;ll consider giving this a run-through. Someone else will probably be able to beat me to it, though.

 I have been researching two pure-bred Nagas and i have come to a conclusion that certain skills are learned at certain levels, but i am still a little uncertain about traits.  My theory is just like most theories posted, containing that all things of exact same&#40;as in main/main is same as main/main,Naga/Naga=Naga/Naga&#41;learn certain traits, but those are learned more randomly.

 I have two suezos, and moves are definitely learned at the same time, at the exact same level &#40;as long as they don&#39;t have the moves through breeding&#41;. Traits are definitely doled out at random times, though. They were both raised identically at first, and their trait lists were in a vastly different order. They had set levels where they would gain a trait, but not _which_ trait. <BR> <BR>Move-based traits &#40;like whip tail, sniper, and pheromone&#41; were gained up until level 9 on both of them. It was the exact same traits, but at different times &#40;one got Sweet Voice at level 2, the other waited until level 6, for instance&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Both monsters got Wind Lore at level 9. I think that&#39;s pure chance, though, since it&#39;s the only example of them getting any trait simultaneously. From levels 10 and onward, they&#39;ve been getting vastly different traits. One has Genius while the other has Machismo. One saw Lucky Star while the other never got the chance at it. One got Hi Recovery, the other got Ice Lore. The suezos are at levels 15 and 16 &#40;once I realized that it would be random, I stopped raising them identically&#41;, so there&#39;s still a little space for them to match up, but I&#39;m very doubtful they&#39;ll have any traits in common from levels 16-20.  <BR> <BR>Also, if you drop a trait for lack of space, it&#39;s possible it&#39;ll show back up to try again. As an example, one Suezo got Lucky Star twice, while the other saw Ice Lore twice.

 i think that the traits that a monster will recieve can also be based on what they were bred with.  I had a naga that i bred with a joker and the naga i recieved got earth lore, while the original never did&#40; they both got to lv.20&#41;.  instead of earth lore, the original got water lore, which the second also never recieved. not sure if this always happens or what, or if breeding is even the reason, but just thought i&#39;d post it.

 The two Suezos I was experimenting with were both pure Suezos, right off the disk. Neither one was bred with anything. Breeding may definitely have something to do with some traits, but it doesn&#39;t have to do with all of them.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally, my suezos retired before either one reached level 20, unfortunately. I could run another test, but this one has me utterly convinced of these things: <BR> <BR>A&#41; Up until level 8, the monsters will have the same or similar traits &#40;possibly until level 9, since both monsters got Wind Lore at the same time, but I&#39;m willing to believe that could be pure chance&#41; <BR> <BR>B&#41; From level 9 &#40;10&#41; until level 15, the traits they get are of the &#39;lesser&#39; type. Basic lores &#40;randomly-gained&#41;, Hi Recovery, Lucky Star, et cetera. <BR> <BR>C&#41; From level 16 on, the monster gains the &#39;good&#39; traits. Hi-traits, Lore&#43;, et cetera. &#40;both monsters got &#39;Popular&#39; at the exact same time: level 16. Again: this could be chance or it could be scheduled&#41; <BR> <BR>D&#41; The moves and adventure traits are always gained at the same levels for the same monster. Seems like Subtype might have some say in it, if the pixie-tests are any evidence, but two of the exact same monster will get the exact same moves at the exact same time. That is, unless the monster hasn&#39;t already got the move because of its subtype, its breeding, or being a special monster.

 Another snippet of information about the traits. It&#39;s possible to get a null gain as a level-up. I have an Ogyo who I&#39;ve been taking on adventures. Three times I got completely destroyed, and thus I took the monsters into the Togle Caves a total of four times. Three of those times, my Ogyo &#40;at level 14&#41; was gaining a lore and a move. The fourth time, it gained... absolutely nothing but the move. This is the first time I&#39;ve experienced this.
