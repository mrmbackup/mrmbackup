 alright, so, I&#39;ve just come back &#40;yay...&#41; and again, I am amazed at all these...excellent ranchers. How do you people make a monster even max out one stat, and still have the others in check for battle? I just cant get it. I&#39;ve been doing this for many months &#40;under a year though in real time&#41; and even my best monsters cant live through ONE FLOOR of ANY &#43; Adventure. Sometimes I even get mauled by Flazer in the Kawrea Volcanoe on the 6th floor. The best I&#39;ve ever had was a dragon &#40;a GameProbot, Dragon/???&#41; that had: <BR> <BR>500&#43; Str &#40;under 550&#41; <BR>400&#43; Acc &#40;under 420&#41; <BR>350&#43; Lif &#40;under 400&#41; <BR>400&#43; Def &#40;under 420&#41; <BR>300&#43; Int &#40;under 390&#41; <BR>390  Spd &#40;exact&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42;note: these are as close as I can remember, because it died about a month ago, real time&#42; <BR> <BR>I think it racked up to around a 2200&#43; overall stat gain. But people here have monsters bred with over 3500 stat gain &#40;or so I&#39;ve heard&#41;. Whats the big secret, really? Anything? The wind drum &#40;of which I CANT FIND!!&#41;? Any particular lv of training gadgets?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not trying to seem pushy for a bunch of answers, I just want to be able to get the better ranching experience. Such as: <BR> <BR>Getting through &#43; Adventures <BR>Winning a S Official &#40;haha, yea, I&#39;m not kidding&#41; <BR>Finding Rainbow Disks <BR> <BR>Any reply &#40;aside from negative ones&#41; will be apriciated! And please dont be angery with me if I&#39;ve missed something in the rest of the site, I havent been here in a while. If so, just re-direct me and then you can delete this for all I care &#40;just, before I know where to look for my answers&#41; :&#41;

 We are probably wasting space here. And I will not be surprised or offended if this thread is deleted asap.   <BR> <BR>1&#41; Getting through Adventure&#43; Areas- Well before you try this you will &#40;for an easy time&#41; need a good &#40;not necessarily uber/maxxed&#41;creature. I&#39;m sorry but its been a looong time since i played through the &#34;initial&#34; stages&#40;pre-wonderwell/wind drum&#41;. But I recall we had 2 &#34;magic&#34; medals and so we produced a magic sandbag and a magic trampoline. To get such medals just adventure over and over in the normal areas.   <BR> <BR>With such devices you can power up a spd/power creature like Garu so he can take on Kawrea Normal and perhaps Togle Caves&#43;. This may take time but if you adventure a LOT, you can get some of the items you will need.     <BR> <BR>General training tips that may be of use:  <BR> <BR>a&#41; Use Oily oil regularly on the creature you want to power up the most.  <BR> <BR>b&#41; Feed with watermelon &#40;or peach if watermelon is disliked&#41; <BR> <BR>c&#41; Try to make the gadgets on your farm cater to similar creatures &#40;Pow/Def or Spd/Int&#41; so you can remove superfluous ones. Of course if you really plan ahead you can schedule removal and placement with the arrival of the gadget guys. But Im lazy so... <BR> <BR>d&#41; Train a creature with good gains and a 4 yr lifespan. Focus on its 2 main attributes. Pls go to the appropriate thread on monsters to select.    <BR> <BR> <BR>2&#41; Winning S Official- Well this is really linked to what creatures you can breed successfully which is linked to your gadgets. So if you like Def/Pow creatures please check out the method I outlined here:   <BR> <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 4 Archive &#40;PS2&#41;: Miscellaneous Q&amp;A &#40;Post New Questions Here&#41; : Monster Breeding Methods... <BR> <BR>Also read the very interesting thread:   <BR> <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 4 Archive &#40;PS2&#41;: Miscellaneous Q&amp;A &#40;Post New Questions Here&#41; : Maxed Monsters? <BR> <BR>This thread &#40;ignore the golden peaches wierdo&#41; contains information which I think can lead to a maxxed monster.  <BR> <BR>3&#41; Finding Rainbow Disks- I have personally found many rainbow disks in Promiass&#43; at level 11 if you search the whole thing. But generally it is random according to many ranchers. Frequency of adventuring will be crucial- so that uber monster will definitely be needed. Also bring along a sacrificial Jell to do all the searching ^_^.

 I&#39;d like to meet the person who made a monster with 3,500 comp.  <BR> <BR>3,000 seems to be the current benchmark.

 I did 3777, and I screwed up royally on this monster &#40;it spent 2 months doing crappy drills because I didn&#39;t level it up fast enough&#41;, it was my first serious try. I&#39;m sure I could do around 3900 with my current file, well maybe if I practiced a little, I&#39;m not sure I remember how to play... <BR> <BR>Iron_Datu&#39;s advice are sound, if I remember correctly, he&#39;s the one who beat 3800 composite.

 @PT- Thank you for your confidence, however I have to acknowledge the great help MRM has been having provided me crucial information that I merely built on. Also, my brother- darkdatu- helped a great deal. <BR> <BR>I have week to week notes on the last creature we raised a golem that reached 3900 composite. I noted the weekly results of training and roughly what it ate and what its status was before and after feeding, training, scolding, praise etc. I hope to post a summary of that near the end of this month- can&#39;t post sooner due to exams.   <BR> <BR>@Pandimonia- One last piece of info, even when you have a &#34;good&#34; creature with 2 high attributes &#40;Spd/Int, Pow/Def, etc, both in the 650-800 range&#41; and a reasonable amt of Acc and Lif &#40;400-500&#43;&#41;, adventure&#43; areas will still NOT be easy- which is why Normal Mode and Togle Caves&#43; are advisable at that point. Lucky counter attacks can force a reload. Of course you can retreat from combat, I just don&#39;t like to.  <BR> <BR>Even with a 3500&#43; creature Kawrea&#43; is also still dangerous-which is why Promiass&#43; for me is ideal for rainbow stones-lvl 11, and toughheart acquisition- lvl 10 is where i get most of them. So at the end of the day, just keep at it.

 woa, wait a second. <BR> <BR>aparently I missed something....for...a while now. <BR> <BR>you can retreat from combat?!  <BR> <BR>that just might be helpful BEFORE I die. <BR>so, where does it say that in the book? I never knew you could, because I always faught, too, but sometimes fights were hopless because my best monster may be out of comission and the other two &#40;or sometimes one&#41; cant handle the monster &#40;usually A monsters, because I just train untill they are formittable agains the monsters of Kawrea&#41;. there, retreating would be most helpful so I could return to my ranch without the enormous gain of stress and tired-ness and a random chance of the monster&#40;s&#41; being sent to the hospital &#40;which backs up my training considerably because if some monster was injured, mine dont come back for about 2-3 months&#41; <BR> <BR>also, when you say:  <BR> <BR>Quote Iron_Datu; &#34;One last piece of info, even when you have a &#34;good&#34; creature with 2 high attributes &#40;Spd/Int, Pow/Def, etc, both in the 650-800 range&#41; and a reasonable amt of Acc and Lif &#40;400-500&#43;&#41;...&#34; <BR> <BR>Yea, hmmm, what you saw above was the best I&#39;ve gotten; period &#40;untill soon, I fused that dragon with another monster &#43;an ironheart, so it&#39;s doing alot better&#41;. so, you&#39;re talking about a fantasy for me untill I attempt most of your ideas and advice for even a 3000 composite monster. <BR> <BR>I also have one final, small, question. Which is a better medal to use on a gadget of lv.2, magic or intense? I seem to use magic for lv2s, and intense for lv3s, which seems to work fine. tell me if this is some sort of mistake if I&#39;m trying to achive a 3000&#43; composite monster. <BR> <BR>thanks for everything so far, and for anything in advance from anyone including Iron_Datu. It&#39;s starting to help. :&#41;

 @MrGG <BR>No problem ^_^. Our last creature was a golem-  Brutacus who had the following stats &#40;3926 composite&#41;: <BR> <BR>4 yrs/2 mos <BR>Lif: 812 <BR>Pow: 999 <BR>Int:49 <BR>Acc: 999 <BR>Spd: 68 <BR>Def: 999  <BR> <BR>If we had not gone on adventures during his adult period, he could have hit 4000 or slightly over.      <BR> <BR>@Pandimonia <BR>Press SELECT when in creature combat. You wil be given an option to &#34;Give Up&#34;. If you do your creature will lose some energy in addition to whatever damage he/she has already sustained. So retreating a lot is not the best option.

 @Pandimonia <BR> <BR>Oh yes as to your question. We use mostly magic and healing medals because of the wonderwell/wind drum combo. Also, we use lvl 2 and lvl 4 training only at present. I don&#39;t recall using intense or lvl 3 much, so I can&#39;t really say. I ditched lvl 3 devices because lvl 4 is better, and IMHO lvl 2 Magic devices are also superior in many ways to lvl 3.

 @Apocalypse <BR> <BR>Hmmm. No I do not think that Int is overrated, it just happened that my Brother and I developed this method after analyzing the gadgets and the stats that could be trained together. The Healing pendulum is an important gadget since it increases Power and Defense at the cost of a stat &#40;INT&#41; that the creature has only a few or no good attacks with.  <BR> <BR>Ultimately we saw that getting Pow and Def up to 999 quickly would mean that skill could be raised to 999 as well, leaving enough training time to raise Health up significantly enough to survive attacks. Spd would similarly be raised minimally since a high Def would mean that hits would generally do negligible damage.   <BR> <BR>I do not think that Int is overrated, its a matter  of training creatures in the stats that they have the best gains in. It just happens that Durahan and Golem are among my favorites. Now if there were a level 4 device for SPD and INT that did not reduce accuracy that would be ideal for a similar method for Int creatures. <BR> <BR>Actually I have been working on a method focusing on SPD/INT creatures and on trying to attain a creature with a composite of over 4500. But again due to other activities I am making slow headway, mea culpa, anyway happy ranching!
