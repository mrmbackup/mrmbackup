Hello, me here This time with an experiment with skinnyness. I took those pixies &#40;read Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 4 Archive &#40;PS2&#41;: Miscellaneous Q&amp;A &#40;Post New Questions Here&#41; : Pixie Lifespan Tests for more information&#41; from the lifespan test and i battled them together in vs mode. I used T6, T7, and T8. T6 and T8 started fat when I loaded and T7 started thin so I fed T8 vitamins for a month to get his weight down to normal. I then saved the pixies as vs data and battled them. I made sure they were at the same focus, same fullness, and same tiredness.All variables that were in the lifespan experiment were kept constant except the feeding of T8. <BR> <BR>Heres the pixies stats <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Name</TD><TD>Weight</TD><TD>Age</TD><TD>Lif</TD><TD>Pow</TD><TD>Int</TD><TD>Acc</TD><TD>Spd</TD><TD>Def</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>T6</TD><TD>Fat</TD><TD>4yr1mo1wk</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>70</TD><TD>170</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>150</TD><TD>65</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>T7</TD><TD>Thin</TD><TD>4yr1mo1wk</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>70</TD><TD>170</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>150</TD><TD>65</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>T8</TD><TD>Normal</TD><TD>4yr1mo1wk</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>70</TD><TD>170</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>150</TD><TD>65</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>I battled T8 vs T8, T7 vs T8 And T6 Vs T8 and recorded the hit percentage for raycast for the second player&#40;T8&#41;. The Monsters both had 99 guts when I checked. Heres what I found <BR> <BR><B>T8 Vs T8</B> 42% chance to hit with Raycast <BR><B>T7 vs T8</B> 39% chance to hit with Raycast <BR><B>T6 vs T8</B> 45% chance to hit with Raycast <BR> <BR>So as you can &#40;or cannot&#41; see The skinnier monsters had a better chance to dodge then the fatter monsters.  <BR> <BR><B>Any questions comments or the likewise?</B>

 This is about the same as it was in MR2...  iirc, as I didn&#39;t do the datawork &#40;but I&#39;ve got a good memory&#41;, basically, the game did its calculations based on your level... however, with SPD and DEF, it modified what the divisor was &#40;and hence the level&#41; due to fatness/form.  For example, if you were thin, it might divide your speed by 35 &#40;instead of 50&#41; to figure out your SPD Level &#40;which is what it based things on&#41;, but it might divide your DEF by 65.  This would end up with a monster that had a higer _apparent_ speed and a lower defense. <BR> <BR>This is all from memory, so the numbers are most definitely wrong...  just the idea for how it operated.

 If this is true, you should probably check to see if fatter monsters take less dmg or something then.

 That&#39;s much harder to test, Durahan, but I agree, it&#39;s worth checking into. <BR> <BR>The problem deals with attacking immediately and hitting, and that&#39;s about the _only_ way to do it.  Even that&#39;s not limiting the variables enough, imo. <BR> <BR>Wyatt

 Somebody with a gameshark could take those pixies &#40;Or whatever monster they are deciding to test&#41; and manipulate their stats to see If the Dodging effect is porportional&#40;blarg&#41; to the speed of the monster. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have a gameshark so I can&#39;t do that. As for damage, If I had a gameshark I could set one of the pixies life stat to 999 and then test but again.. No gameshark.. If I were to test damage it would be long and tedious and I have other tests planned.

 I would think that Gameshark data might not be pure because it would edit some things that are vital to the experiment <BR> <BR>Although im not the gameshark expert, so dont take my thoughts as fact.

 I&#39;ve tested this a little further. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve taken an Ogyo of 800 speed at normal weight and battled it against an Antlan. The antlan had these percentages to hit: 44 35 45. <BR> <BR>I made that Ogyo thin and that same antlan had these percentages: 38 29 39. <BR> <BR>Then I trained the normal weight ogyo to maxxed speed. The antlan now had these percentages: 17 9 18. <BR> <BR>Making that maxxed speed ogyo thin didn&#39;t improve his speed. <BR> <BR>So my conclusions are weight&#39;s influence in battle is really minor.

 Or that it can only bump a stat up to maxx evasion at best...like it was in MR2. So, a stat would be at 999 without actually being 999.

 In MR2, the speed increase was much more drastic. From the percentages I&#39;ve seen in MR4, the best weight factor would improve by 2 or 3 levels max.
