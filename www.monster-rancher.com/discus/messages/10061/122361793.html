 Just thought we could make a chart of all the documents and what they say. Post what you can, &#40;include the full, exact text&#41; and I will make it into a table.

 Some documents do not cause reading material to appear in the library. As well, it would be difficult to determine which of the starting documents gives you what starting reading material. <BR> <BR>So, basically, i&#39;m saying that you shouldn&#39;t plan on documenting numbers too, only a bit of a &#34;heads up&#34; if you had that in mind.
