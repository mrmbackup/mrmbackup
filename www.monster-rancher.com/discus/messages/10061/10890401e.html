Poison causes the monster to lose hps one at a time until it wears off, not sure if it has any other effects. <BR>

Cursed seems to slow down the oppenents regen rate &#40;maybe even start a negative regen of their guts?&#41; and makes them slightly easier to hit, from my experiences so far. <BR>

 My Assassaripper has an attack called &#34;Phantom&#34; which results in a battle effect called &#34;Caution&#34; Anyone know what this does?

 barrier seen an Aero&#40;pixie/tiger&#41; do a move I believe was called Force Shield. I think that it raises defense maybe just against int attacks I haven&#39;t got the final move for my pixie yet so I don&#39;t have anything to back this other than my own observations as of now.

 My assassiripper has started picking up a stransge new battle effect. After a succuessful physical attack, ex: hell, the battle effect &#34;Real&#34; comes up. I haven&#39;t seen any real effect thus far, but It has only happened since I obtained the third physical attack and reached rank B. Anyone have any ideas?

 Force Shield is a Pixie tech. I don&#39;t have it yet, but I have seen it on tourney opponents. So it produces a Barrier effect, huh?... Back to the Ranch!!

 &#39;Real&#39; was a joker-only special in MR2. It raised all your monster&#39;s stats, but lowered them when &#39;Real&#39; wore off. I&#39;ve watched my monster&#39;s guts regen and movement speed go up when it got Real &#40;a Naga/Hengar, in my case&#41;, so I suspect it&#39;s probably the same thing.

 A little more detail on how &#39;poison&#39; works. It makes the monster lose 1% of their HP until it wears off. This is rounded down, and it goes by _present_ HP rather than _maximum_ HP. So a monster with 100 HP will lose only 1 HP to poison, while one with 245HP will lose 2HP per turn until it wears off, or until they get to 199, upon which time they&#39;ll lose only 1 per. A monster with less than 100 HP left is unaffected by poison&#39;s HP loss. If there&#39;s any other effects by poison, I&#39;ve yet to notice them.

I know. A lot of stuff one after the other, but I&#39;m playing at different times. I&#39;m hoping the editing will clean it up. :&#41; <BR> <BR>&#39;Caution&#39; does not directly influence the hit-rate of the enemy monster. I had a Ripper/Joker use it, and my monster&#39;s hit rate stayed the same &#40;65% before it was used, up to 67% after because of guts, and still 67% after it wore off&#41;. I think it probably does what it did in MRA2: gives an automatic dodge. Therefore, no matter how high your hit percentage is, the monster will get out of the way as long as they&#39;re &#39;Cautioned&#39;. <BR> <BR>Plus, same monster got slowed. My hit rate did not go up, but their movement rate did go down. I had no problems moving to whatever range I wanted while they were slowed. I also hit directly afterward, so it&#39;s possible that it makes the next hit automatic, but with a 64% chance to hit, it&#39;s hard to tell for certain.

 ive hit monsters under caution so it is not an automatic miss. curently im thinking it gives a boost to the monsters speed and this usually makes the opponents accuracy drop but once a monster achieves a certain speed level or the opponent reaches a certain accuracy level the change is less noticable. <BR> <BR>also from what i have seen the only effect of slow is that the monster doesnt move as fast makeing it easier to move toward or away from him.

 I&#39;m pretty sure that &#39;Caution&#39; makes the monster that uses it have a lot more evasion because whe I used it my opponent&#39;s hit rate dropped severely.

 Caution also makes it so the enemy can&#39;t counter your next attack.
