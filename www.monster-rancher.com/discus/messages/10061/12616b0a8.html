 I&#39;ve finished the plotty stuff in MR4, so now I&#39;m just working on filling out my book and raising monster types I haven&#39;t had a chance to yet.  I would, however, at some point like to have a look around the extra dungeons and beat the S-class tournaments.  The problem is, my monsters don&#39;t seem to have what it takes.  Most of them get to S class no trouble &#40;unless they get stuck at a low level for a really long time due to scheduling conflicts or have really bad stats or short lifespan&#41;, but the S class monsters are, well, monsters.  And the extra dungeons are full of S classers. <BR> <BR>Is it me?  Am I doing something wrong in my training?  Or are only a certain few monsters, carefully bred and trained, going to have what it takes to kick butt in class S? <BR> <BR>For what it&#39;s worth, my training method is as follows: all level 2 training gadgets.  Praise for 70% or better, scold for 69% or worse.  &#40;I stop scolding when they become &#39;weak&#39;.&#41;  Rest when tiredness is 1/3 or more.  Feed when resting, unless hunger gets bad when they&#39;re not tired &#40;due to them enjoying low-cal foods&#41;.  Food choice is one of their top four favorites, whatever I have the most of.  Give items when they&#39;re frustrated, unless I scolded them that week &#40;I don&#39;t like giving mixed messages&#41;.  Always rest them the week of a competition or adventure, even if they don&#39;t need it.  Give Oily Oil if necessary to get them lively for a match. <BR> <BR>When training, I determine whether their best offensive stat is STR or INT and whether their best defensive stat is SPD, DEF, or LIF.  Then I train in the following ratio: <BR>&#42; 4 best offensive stat <BR>&#42; 4 ACC &#40;I hate missing&#41; <BR>&#42; 2 best defensive stat <BR>&#42; 1 other defensive stat &#40;just in case&#41; <BR>&#42; 1 other other defensive stat <BR> <BR>I start entering them in competitions when they&#39;re about a year old.  I use the jungle and ruins adventures as &#39;training grounds&#39; to get them skills; in the jungle, a single B-class or better monster can train two other monsters, but for the ruins I like to have two good fighters so they can trade off.  I only go into the volcano with a team of A-class or better. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got the Ice Age DVD, so if I have to start cloning White Mocchi to take out S-class, I can.

 Its a bit late, but no matter since there are no others here. <BR> <BR>The problem I see is that you do not have a wind drum. You should spend your effort on that and getting some level 4 gadgets. I assume that praise at 70% means that you do not get high percent. The drum is the best way to remedy that. I believe you can force it to a bit more than 1/3 tiredness without ill effects. Risk it if you want to. Later in your career, you can stockpile oily oil to take more risks. Use them ,and multiple praises for stress, to take a monster back to normal status. <BR> <BR>Also, don&#39;t rely on training in quantity with lower training routines. Lvl 1 becomes a waste after infancy, and such. Fitting a lvl 4 with a lvl 2 can be a better use of time than only level 2. For which gadgets to use and how many times, get an average for each and project the amount of stat total you can accomplish in 3 months.

 Well, I have the numbers for level 2 and 3 &#40;from this site&#41;, and level 3 looks a little better... if I could get equivalent performance percentages, which I can&#39;t.  I don&#39;t have any numbers for level 4 gadgets.  As for the Wind Drum, yeah, I want one.  Gotta keep trying those adventures until I get them.  &#40;I have access to all the level 4 gadgets, but as I mentioned in another post, I couldn&#39;t get above 50% on them, so it was a waste of time.&#41;

I&#39;m just going to tack some things on here: <BR> <BR>1: Don&#39;t use level 3 gadgets. Use Magic Level 2 gadgets instead. Ignore that comparison chart, please. It has issues. <BR> <BR>2: Praising for stress relief has <I><B>not</B></I> been proven. Anyone who tells you to do this may be giving you false information with no backing. So many things are going on that, while a monster may have a different message after a praise, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it helped. Feeding carrots and watermelons on a weekly/bi-weekly basis is probably the best, if not most sound way of avoiding and healing stress. A Vitamin every now and then counters the weight. <BR> <BR>3: Use level 4 gadgets. Intense and Healing seem to be predominent. Intense if you have focus issues. I reccomend using them with monsters that have no lower than 5 in either gaining stat, preferrably higher.

 Hi guys.  <BR> <BR>Praising seems to have some random element to it. I have praised at times to &#34;relieve&#34; stress. Sometimes it seems to work but at others it doesn&#39;t. I do it anyway though since I prefer not to  bribe with items or food.  <BR> <BR>Personally, though I think it does tend to work , though I haven&#39;t recorded all the results, since I have used scolding to remove being spoiled with the result that the creature became frustrated. So I suppose praise does the opposite, again there does seem to be a random element to it.

 Praising does reduce stress at the cost of style becoming easier.  Though I have had to praise 4-5 times before it became OK, sometimes.  Also for the level 4 training gadgets only certain monsters can get the maximum amount of gain which is 30 main stat to 20 secondary stat.  My Antlan/Joker has gotten the max on Moving Target with an 80&#43;% success rate but he was at the Harder Style, and went down to 50-% when at Normal and Easier Style.  Someone else said you had to use a monster that had a high gain in both Main and Secondary stats for that level 4 Gadget, which makes sense because my Antlan/Joker was good at Acc. and Def. <BR>    I just registered but I&#39;ve been checking this site out for a year and I love it!  I go nowhere else at all.  This site is great and I would like to help in as many ways I can with the research too!
