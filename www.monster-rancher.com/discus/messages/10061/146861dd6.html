 Hellow kiddies? How&#39;re you? Miss me much? Well, let&#39;s get past the formalities and get down to business... <BR> <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 4 Archive &#40;PS2&#41;: Miscellaneous Q&amp;A &#40;Post New Questions Here&#41; : Maxed Monsters?  <BR> <BR>In that thread, it asked what the highest composite stats were for monsters. I was wondering this too, however, the thread is a few years old and it&#39;s closed down... so, what is the current max composite? Any general idea of how it was achieved?  <BR> <BR>From the little I&#39;ve read last night, some tips seem to be to use M Lv. 2 Gadgets, have a wind drum &#40;may not apply&#41;, feed watermelons, use oily oils &#40;may not apply&#41;, use vitamins for weight. <BR> <BR>That pretty much seems to be the gist of what raising should be, but I couldn&#39;t seem to find any hardcore &#34;method&#34; such as in MR2 or MR3.

 I think that&#39;s about it. IIRC, Petit Trot &amp; SlapShotz had some of the highest stats of anyone playing this game, but you can see a lot of people&#39;s monster&#39;s stats here: <BR> <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: The Coliseum &#40;Public Monster Rancher Tournaments&#41;: Mayors Cup: Metropolis Champions &#40;MR4&#41; <BR> <BR>Maybe you could email them and ask if they had any sort of setup they recommend.

 I haven&#39;t played in a long time, but I know a few of us were up around 4000 &#40;&#43; or -&#41; towards the end. <BR> <BR>A lot of people were playing around with different ideas, using a lot of the things you mentioned; but I don&#39;t think there were any set in stone methods, just general methods.

 That makes me a sad camper. So any chance of a &#34;method&#34; popping up? I&#39;m still around the 2k mark and struggling. <BR> <BR>And since I don&#39;t want to make too much clutter by starting a new thread, any chance for a low compositie tourney?

 A tourney? Hmmm, it&#39;s been a while. I don&#39;t know. We&#39;d need a host, and PT can&#39;t host anymore.

 I&#39;d want to do it and be willing to, but... can&#39;t. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in a different time zone &#40;Pakistan&#41;. <BR>There are planned power shut downs here and there is no schedule for them, so the power may go out right in the middl of a fight and well... That&#39;d leave everyone hanging. <BR>I&#39;m on dial-up and haven&#39;t tested whether I can access the chat room on MRM. I&#39;ve tried chatrooms on other sites &#40;facebook for example&#41; and they don&#39;t seem to work with dial-up. <BR> <BR>That being said, if we can find a host, I think it&#39;d be pretty cool to get a tourney in. Perhaps a FFA or a Baby Challenge of sort so anyone can enter? Or a low composite like 1k or something?  <BR> <BR>If we don&#39;t have a host by say, end up July, I&#39;d be willing to do it because I&#39;ll be in Australia then so the last two points will be moot and there&#39;ll only be a time zone difference, but I&#39;m sure we can accomodate something on that.

 I think you&#39;ll have more trouble finding entrants than a host. Not only that, but if you do find either one, you&#39;re going to have to deal with all the Max Drive/X-Port &#40;or Sharkport&#41; stuff &#40;that is, where someone wants to use or only has one or the other, and someone else can&#39;t comply with that, and...yuck...but it&#39;s not as much of a problem if the host has both&#41;. <BR> <BR>MR4 tournaments were never the most popular, and the CP controlled battles were lacking compared to most other games. It&#39;d be nice to see some sort of tournaments being run, though. Having that option there is always nice. <BR> <BR>I still have an MR2 monster that needs some action...
