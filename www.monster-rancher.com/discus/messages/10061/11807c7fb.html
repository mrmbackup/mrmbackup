In the process of doing some lifespans, I decided to stop and take a look at this. I found the percentages by measuring my screen. On my screen the whole bar is 11.5cm &#40;sorry, I didn&#39;t measure in inches, and can&#39;t convert worth crap&#41;. That number is taken by measuring only the yellow bar itself, and doesn&#39;t include the symbol of the hunger bar &#40;seeing as that doesn&#39;t measure hunger and all&#41;. <BR> <BR>Just for the sake of showing it to you, I&#39;ll write out my measurements and their percentages. <BR> <BR>&#42;All percentage numbers have been rounded to the nearest 1/10th and whole number. <BR>7.5/11.5---60.9% or 70% &#40;OK&#41; <BR>8.5/11.5---73.9% or 74% &#40;Lively&#41; <BR>8/11.5---69.6% or 70% &#40;OK&#41; <BR>6.5/11.5---56.5% or 57% &#40;OK&#41; <BR>5.5/11.5---47.8% or 48% &#40;OK&#41; <BR>5/11.5---43.5% or 44% &#40;OK&#41; <BR>4.5/11.5---39% &#40;OK&#41; <BR>4.3/11.5---37.4% or 37% &#40;Hungry&#41; <BR>&#40;Skipping some now, all numbers in between get me to &#34;Hungry&#34;&#41; <BR>1.5/11.5---13% &#40;Hungry&#41; <BR>1/11.5---8.7% or 9% &#40;Hungry&#41; <BR>0/11.5---0% &#40;Starving&#41; <BR>I hit each number numerous times, and had the same results each time. Monsters were rested all the time, so they had no fatigue when doing these tests. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="11aqbc">So, from this I take the percentages status: <BR>70&#43;% of fulness bar=Lively <BR>38%-70% of fulness bar=OK <BR>?%-38% of fulness bar=Hungry <BR>0%-?% of fulness bar=Starving</FONT> <BR> <BR>Now, about the ?%&#39;s. I was wondering if I should put in 5%, or 0% for that number. It seems logical, but 5% was a number I could never hit, no matter how hard I tried. I&#39;ll leave that up one of the admins. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">Important!

 I only have one comment, and more of an observation than anything else.  I&#39;ve noticed, but not tested due to a wife that isn&#39;t fond of video games and a daughter not old enough to play yet, that when a monster reaches the fat status, that it gets hungrier faster.  By this I mean the hungry prompt comes up without the bar dropping as far.  I can&#39;t say this is totally true for sure, but it would make sense, being true to life, and it sure seemed like it with a couple of monsters whose weight I had lost track of.  I would imagine that at the other end of the spectrum, Thin and such, that it takes longer for the monster to get hungry.  If by some miracle I get a chance to test this theory, I&#39;ll do it, but if anyone has more time and is intrigued, please be my guest.

It has been previously pointed out by Harrabcat that fatter monsters do get hungrier faster. This should actually be concluded now as 100% pure fact, if it has not already been proclaimed so. My suspicions are that thin monsters get hungry faster as well though, other than the opposite. <BR> <BR><I>&#34;By this I mean the hungry prompt comes up without the bar dropping as far.&#34;</I> <BR> <BR>The previous information I posted was at multiple points within the monsters&#39; lives. Throughout, some managed to get chubby, one got fat, and the other was normal. Other than the borderline percentages &#40;72%, 38%&#41; status, nothing changed. At that borderline percent, it actually seemed random as to which you would get, which is why both statistics include that number. Thus concludes, the monsters still got hungry at the same percentage, only their fulness bar dropped faster.

 I made a posting a while ago &#40;and can&#39;t find it; I hope I&#39;m not saying something that was deemed to be crap&#41; about my monsters going from &#39;Ok&#39; to &#39;Frustrated&#39; when I fed them. It&#39;s happened multiple times for me, on almost every type of food &#40;mangoes being the most glaring example&#41;. <BR> <BR>Is your monster&#39;s tiredness/focus the same for all of these tests? Or does one, the other, or both change?

&#34;Frustrated&#34; status has nothing to do with this information, actually. The aggrevated/frustrated status&#39;, as far as I know, deal with stress/tiredness &#40;unless there&#39;s another statistic for them to deal with&#41;. This is hunger <B>only</B>. <BR> <BR>In a sense, the &#34;bars&#34; overlap. Depending on the severity, it seems, other statistics will overlap. The only &#34;universal&#34; ones are &#34;OK&#34; and &#34;Lively&#34;. As far as I know, the hunger messages come first. This is why you can go from &#34;Hungry&#34; to &#34;Aggrevated&#34;, instead of say, &#34;OK&#34;. <BR> <BR>Measuring stress levels will cause a problem, as I cannot see the stress bar. Hunger levels was easy, because there is a fulness bar. <BR> <BR>To answer your question: The monsters were never tired, and the focus varied, however, they were at the same level of focus numerous times. I&#39;ll also add that they never reached any of the stress status&#39;. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a diagram of what I mean: <BR>&#60;Lively&#62;-----&#60;OK&#62;---&#60;Hungry&#62;---&#60;Starving&#62; <BR>&#60;Frustrated&#62;-&#60;Aggrevated&#62;-&#60;OK&#62;---&#60;Lively&#62; <BR> <BR>As you can see, the bars work opposite each other. It works out so that the hunger status&#39; would overlap, or take priority over, any stress status, and when your monster is stressed, that message replaces th &#34;OK&#34; or &#34;Lively&#34; status. I hope that makes sense.

 The thing is, the monsters were listed as &#39;Ok&#39; when I fed them. It wasn&#39;t until after they ate, and their bar was fuller, that they were &#39;frustrated&#39;. And this includes feeding them with foods that are liked. My Garu&#39;s favorite was &#39;meat&#39;. I fed him &#39;meat&#39; when he was &#39;Ok&#39;. He turned to &#39;frustrated&#39;. So &#39;Ok&#39; isn&#39;t a universal in this case.

 Hmmm...I suppose &#34;OK&#34; would be a hunger status then as well? I never really had the oppurtunity to look into that, as my monsters were never stressed. &#34;OK&#34; didn&#39;t seem to have anything to do with hunger, so I assumed &#40;I am a bad boy, assuming like that&#41; that it was universal. While &#34;OK&#34; may not be universal, it still appears that &#34;Lively&#34; is. So, frustrated still has nothing to do with this, as it deals with hunger. Good point though, really good point. Now, to figure out a way to look into stress more precisely...

 In my experiences, from going &#39;Ok&#39; to &#39;Frustrated&#39;, was after feeding. However, I always thought it had something to do with the focus bar. <BR> <BR>When focus was to the left &#40;and pointing left&#41; They went from &#39;Ok&#39; to &#39;Lively&#39;, but when they only had two red arrows, both pointing right, they went from &#39;Ok&#39; to &#39;Frustrated&#39;. <BR> <BR>I know this is for hunger only, but it is difficult to say what status is for what meter, especially when all the status types appear in the same block. If it solved any of the hunger status, it was replaced immediatly by the focus one.

 Uno problemo. I tested this thouroughly, however, I only used one breed. Hengers. So, today I remembered something which I believe was suggested to me by Harrabcat. I went out and tested it, and sure enough, this is what I found: Different monsters go by different percentages. I tested a monster &#40;a Ducken, iirc, don&#39;t have my exact data in front of me&#41; at &#34;OK&#34; at about 78%&#40;9/11.5&#41;. This would need more looking into now. Crap.

 So they actually _do_ have monsters having a lot more differences &#40;or more; don&#39;t know about a lot&#41; thank just statgains and moves, this time around. I like it. It&#39;ll make it tough on a lot of things, but I very much like it.

 Wow, yet another problem arises. I had my Ripper/Tiger at near full focus, no hunger, seemingly no stress&#40;very little, if anyhing&#41;, but his tired bar was approx. 40% full. This brought about the &#34;OK&#34; status.  <BR> <BR>Toss another status changing factor on the the bbq. Not to much of a surprise, but the fact that it brings about the &#34;OK&#34; status is a pain, and makes figuring things out a tad harder.

 I think the ok status comes when the monster is between not hungry to full around &#40;90%-55% full rough estimate&#41;. Also the tired meter would have to between not tired and not lively&#40;45%-85% another rough estimate&#41;. I&#39;ve noticed situations like this several times because I often train in this situation but I almost always rest before the monster is tired. The only reason a monster may have gotten tired is if it did training and had a tourney the same week. I also always feed before the gauge goes to 70% usaully around 80%-90%. These are just some things I saw...... Correct me if I made any mistakes

 The &#34;OK&#34; status has been proven to come from Hunger and Fatigue. That&#39;s basically what a lot of this thread is about &#40;unfortuneately&#41;. The percentages have been proven to vary by breed as earlier stated.

 Inf, do you want to post something about hunger becoming fatigue or whatever in a better section than Miscellaneous? I&#39;ve already deleted some of your posts about hunger and lifespan. I hope you don&#39;t mind too much, I should have asked first. But the ones I deleted really didn&#39;t bring anything that isnt now posted elsewhere.

 Done. If you find one of the threads &#40;I think there&#39;s two&#41; that tells how fatter monsters get hungry faster, that can also go under &#34;Ranching tips&#34;. One is far better then the other, IIRC.
