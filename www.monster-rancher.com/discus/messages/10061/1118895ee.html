 Well, I normally don&#39;t look at the book, but I did, and found something interesting. <BR> <BR>In the back, where they list Special Thanks, they list Lisa &#40;and website&#41; and Fenrick. I just wanted to take this time to thank them for all their help with the game, and their dedication to make the game what it has become. ^_^

 Man Tecmo really listens to their gamers dont they. Makes you want to stay with them for a long time :&#41;. Also makes you feel like what you say is important to what they think and how they make the game. I wish other Game developers would do this too.

 Fenrick, what did you do? <BR> <BR>I know Lisa&#39;s role, but is your mention for the same thing, or for your tourney&#39;s, etc? <BR> <BR>I really wish I could help in a meaningful way. All I&#39;ve done is convince one person to get it.

 i forgot to list my games, I started listing when the Wife helped me shrine, since.. on a 56k Connection it takes as long for her to shrine 1 CD as it takes me to make the entry... so it all works out. :&#41;

 A big, &#34;You&#39;re Welcome&#34; to WHT and the others! Fen and I both moderate Tecmo&#39;s message boards, a fairly time-consuming task. We also gave input on the MR4 game, and were generally around when Tecmo needed small favors.

 speaking of Tecmo listening to their players, is there a place to comment to them on opinions of the game? I was thinking with enough positive feedback they&#39;d make another MR game :P &#40;not that I&#39;ve finished or am tired of this one!&#41; <BR> <BR>one thing I was disappointed with is how creating monsters from your cd collection seems to be not as easy as before. You can&#39;t get the Monster Breed Name, Main &amp; Sub species, stats, etc right after you create them, before you accept them to take them home now. &#40;as I am sure you have all noticed&#41;. I sort of think this is a setback from the other games. <BR> <BR>But I think the adventures in MR4 are better than ever! They definitely made adventuring a lot of fun :&#41;

You can always post in the MR4 forums at <A HREF="http://www.tecmogames.com/cgi-bin/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi" TARGET="_blank">Tecmo&#39;s Message Boards</A>. They are peeking around looking for reactions to the game, right now....

 I have no idea. Did the japanese version allow for the main character&#39;s name to be changed? I know some weren&#39;t sure that&#39;d be the case in the US version. I dunno. I remember talking about that with you there. &#40;I&#39;m kawaiipd there&#41; Maybe next version they&#39;ll have a male and female lead. ;&#41; But I definitely think at least putting your opinion there gives them a greater chance to see it.

 I hope so :&#41; <BR>Lisa said it would. <BR>This is such a great game series. <BR>It&#39;s funny, my friends who don&#39;t play are like &#34;whatever&#34;, but the ones I get addicted are as bad as me!

 Spreading the word is good too as Lisa said in another post. <BR>I finally got a friend of mine to buy it after bugging them. Hehe. <BR>And another person I talked to online said they liked the old MRs but hated three, but last I talked to them about MR4 they said they should pick it up. Hehe.

 I had recently brought it over my cousins house and I showed it to them and they completely fell in love with it. So I said that they should get it and my aunt said she would get it for them for Christmas. :P

 I also helped localize MF4 for the US. I played MF4 and turned in bug reports, and general play info for the US office.
