I will go through the first 6 months of my Henger&#39;s lives, recording all changes here.  <BR>Please note: <BR>D1P had a &#34;Cool&#34; temper. <BR>All others were &#34;Serious&#34;. <BR>Food is shown by last letter of name &#40;P=Potato, Sc=Screw, CF=Canned Fuel&#41; <BR>Method of being obtained indicated by first letter &#40;D=Disc, C=Combining, E=Encyclopedia&#41; <BR>All monsters were Henger&#39;s, and were rested throughout their lives. No other variables were thrown in. <BR> <BR><U>Year/Month/Week</U> <BR>12/10/1: Birth. Focus full &#40;5 arrows, left&#41; <BR>12/11/2: All but D1P&#39;s arrows point right. <BR>12/12/2: D1P&#39;s arrows point right. <BR>12/12/4: All but D1P -1 arrow. All monsters fed, all &#43;1 arrow. <BR>13/1/1: All but D1P -1 arrow. <BR>13/1/2: D2CF arrows point left. <BR>13/1/3: All but D1P&#39;s arrows now point left. <BR>13/1/4: C2Sc -1 arrow. C2Sc &#43;1 arrow &#40;feeding&#41;. <BR>13/2/1: D2CF &#43;1 arrow. C2Sc &#43;1 arrow &#40;freetime&#41;. <BR>13/2/2: E1P, C1P &#43;1 arrow.

D1P has gone through the least changes and is most stable at 5 arrows, right. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s actually a little more than 6 months, but oh well. <BR> <BR><U>Conclusions</U> <BR>1: The order of focus, from best to worst &#40;for all of you who deny it&#41; <B>is</B> 5L,5R,4L,4R,3L,3R,2L,2R,1L,1R. <BR>2: Monsters with a &#34;Cool&#34; temper do better under low working conditions than &#34;Serious monsters. <BR>3: Monsters with a &#34;Serious&#34; temper don&#39;t do well under low working conditions. <BR> <BR>Any comments? Questions? Attempts to say I&#39;m a lying piece of crap? &#40;The biggest question being: Should I go further into their lives?&#34;&#41;

 While I was raising my pixies I had similar fluxuation in the focus levels, anywhere from pointing the wrong way to being off by one and pointing the wrong way. Then again I had some pixies that had the &#34;Not Serious&#34; temper and that could have something to do with it. I wish I kept more accurate notes. Oh well. <BR>&#40;To be filed this under comments&#41;

 does anything really mean anything the way the arrows point.becuasemy rockdragon and umm &#40;mocchi/antler&#41; there arrows point different ways but they get the same amount of gain and percentage.or does it just tell you that its going to go down if continue to do what your doing?MR4 can be so confusing at times and fun. <BR> <BR>P.S.I&#39;m new Hi there!

 As far as I know, it&#39;s a matter of probability. Four arrows pointing left and four arrows pointing right are essentially the same, only, your odds of doing better are higher when they point left. <BR> <BR>Does_not_mean_it&#39;s_going_to_go_down!

 Recently, one of my monsters hit 0 arrows.  I think you may need to add 0L,0R to the list or else just 0.  Has anyone else ever seen a monster hit 0 arrows? It was a first for me.  It occured with a salamander &#40;zuum/dragon&#41; a combo from an S rank Kirin and an A-rank Crevasse &#40;dragon/tiger&#41;. It occured when I entered my already tired monster into a battle and then to a Kalaragi expedition.  He was Rank B with a High Pride Temperment. His size was normal, Likes Emerald Dislikes Play and has an easier policy. <BR> <BR>Notes:  <BR>1.I have no idea whether he was hungry or not  <BR>2.I technically have not proved the existence of the right facing 0 arrows as his arrows pointed left <BR>3. If you wish to test this I suggest abusing a monster like you were trying to get Mock in MR2. :&#41;  If you have something that lowers focus I reccomend you use it <BR>4. I did not see what he got for stat-gains with no arrows as I reset when I realized how terrible I had been ignoring him.  I did not realize no one had posted this in the archives or I would have tried it.

 When you reach certian points in the game&#39;s story, a carpenter will come by and offer to upgrade your ranch. The first time he will upgrade it so you can carry 3 monsters, the second so that you can carry five. As to where in the story these points are, I suggest looking in the faq section b/c I don&#39;t remeber.
