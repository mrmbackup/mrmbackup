 Greetings,  <BR> <BR>First off, let me say I have enjoyed reading and getting all the information from others from the site.  it has helped me tremendously improve at the game.   <BR> <BR>From time to time, I look at different ways to play games for a challenge to refresh the game and enjoy it.  I was wondering if anyone else has considered this following option and if they feel it would be worth trying. <BR> <BR>Start the game fresh and instead of using any of your CDs/DVDs, play the game as if you ONLY have the MR4 game.  In other words, you can shrine it later, but go through the game without using any other CDs/DVDs.  While I know this is half the fun of the game, the goal of playing it the other way would be to see how many races you could get through the game itself.  You&#39;d be allow to breed to get races and only use the stones you find while adventuring.  I always found it kinda rewarding getting stones and getting races I had not found yet &#40;part of why I enjoy the &#43;adventures, trying to find all the rares due to access to the appropriate discs&#41;.   <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be curious how long it would take to fill up the book or how much of the book could be filled in X time.  I&#39;ve considered doing this myself but with classes recently, I have not had the time to dedicate to it.  Not to mention it would let you replay the early game for those who have not done it in a while.   <BR> <BR>Hopefully this doesn&#39;t seem like a silly idea but give people another way to enjoy the game.

 If you think it&#39;s a good idea, then it&#39;s work for you to do yourself. This falls squarely into the &#39;do your own research&#39; guideline for the site.  <BR> <BR>We already have a lot of unfinished projects on the site involving basic game research that need work. We all have jobs, school, and other responsibilities. We work on the site when we can. Replaying the whole game from scratch based on some other person&#39;s idea of fun sounds like a second job to me, one that I cannot afford to subsidize.

 Essentially, the amount of time it would take would be somewhat random. Some people get a different monster each time, some get the same one ten times over. The only way for you to know how long it would take is to do it yourself. <BR> <BR>Some of us are doing this. I only shrine specials personally.

 Okay, perhaps what I was trying to say did not come across correctly.  I did not mean it as a &#39;project&#39; for people to do.  I do understand it will take different amount of times for all individuals because it would depend on how much you played.  I look for different ways to play games when I get done with them the basic way or feel like I&#39;ve burned out playing the game and I had not seen anything similar to this posted for a different way to liven up the game.  Take it as a suggestion on a different way to play the game-if you find it not something that would appeal to you, then enjoy the game how you like to.   <BR> <BR>This is a way I&#39;ll play the game eventually to give me something to do when I don&#39;t want to think too much and I just thought I would share the idea.  Sorry for it coming across wrong. <BR> <BR>Have a good day.
