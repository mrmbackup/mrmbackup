 I went on an adventure to the jungle &#40;the name slipped my mind&#41;. I went up to the 6th floor and could not go on nor go back to the ranch because there were no &#34;exits&#34; or &#34;floor up&#34;. i had to leave the adventure through the &#34;command&#34; menu. <BR> <BR>this was a random adventure. &#40;not w/ storyline&#41; <BR> <BR>was there another way out? or was it a glitch?

 Have you comepleted the storyline? Have you unlocked everything? <BR> <BR>In the jungle, there are things you have to find that deal with the storyline, even though you might not notice. What your describing sounds exactly like it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not going to spoil it and tell you what it is unless you want me to.

 Well, there wasn&#39;t anything unusual about that floor. i went to every room and there werent anything in them &#40;except for the occasional treasure&#41;. I&#39;ve unlocked the pheonix breed, and i thought that was pretty much the end of the storyline. i unlocked the adventure &#43;&#39;s, but i wasnt on Kalaragi Jungle &#43;. so i don&#39;t think it really was a storyline... but i dont mind you telling me what i&#39;m actually suposed to do. thank you for taking your time to respond.

 Well, if you don&#39;t have Mocchi &#40;which you can apparently miss&#41;, Geras appears on the sixth floor, and you have to go far enough into an empty room to battle him. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s not that, then I&#39;m guessing you missed a switch, or somehow got placed into the Mocchi scenario again by glitch.

 I&#39;ve already unlocked Mocchi, and on the 6th floor there wasnt the room for the battle with Geras. I probably just missed something, but it seemed like ive been to all the rooms and there just wasn&#39;t anywhere else to go... <BR> <BR>I guess forget it for now, since it was probably just me missing something, but if it happens again to me or anyone else, it&#39;ll be something to look into &#40;?&#41;. thanks though.

 It happened again. I went up to Kalaragi Jungle&#39;s 6th floor, and there was _no where_ to go.

 I posted this question somewhere else, but: What if I haven&#39;t unlocked Mocchi, I&#39;ve gone to Kalaragi several times, and searched all the rooms on the 6th floor, AND IT DOESN&#39;T LET ME FIGHT THE BOSS. It just doesn&#39;t get triggered for some reason. Glitch?

 Nope, not a glitch. There is one almost circular room on that floor where the battle occurs. It seems to be hard to trigger. Just keep running around that room. Took me about three complete circuits quartering the whole area before I hit the right spot.
