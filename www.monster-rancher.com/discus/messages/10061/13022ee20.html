 I got to the part where Philia appears but Chiho did not change stance!  Now when I go back she talks about random things and not the date thing!  Have I messed up my game entirely?  Do I maybe need to get the Togle one first? <BR> <BR>note: I have beaten Xevion

 Sorry for the double post but I&#39;d like to say that if I can only get the Torble one now, this strongly suggests Infernus&#39;s theory that they need to be obtained in order.

Actually, if you do get it now, after the fact, it would be good to know. I never have heard of anyone getting them out of order, and actually, I&#39;ve never heard of anyone other than myself getting the Vizley upgrade. <BR> <BR>And always remember when doing this: <BR> <BR><I>&#34;Don&#39;t be discouraged if you don&#39;t get this on your first attempt. If you&#39;ve gone every chance you had for about a year, go somewhere else, completely break all rules I mention, and start there again.</I>

 Get this, I went to Torble one time after getting the Togle upgrade and BAM Torble upgrade.  Infernus I thnk you got something with the order thing.  I think Ryumn is a lost cause as you can&#39;t talk to the shopkeeper.  Vizley here I come!

 Actually I got them out of order this last time I played for sure. The first few saves I don&#39;t know because I wasn&#39;t paying attention but this time I know I got them out of order. I went to Togle then Vizley then Torble. Vizley is easy I think but takes longer for that convo between Talt and Laurier. Did anyone else ever notice that they call him HIM/HIS/HE for the whole game but after the shop upgrade in Vizley there is a part where Laurier calls him She? It&#39;s sort of bizarre I think though I always thought he was a she anyway because of that super manly pink smock and headband but who knows.

 A couple &#40;late&#41; notes from my attempt to get this upgrade. <BR> <BR>I got the upgrade before beating Xevion &#40;I&#39;m not sure exactly where I am in the story, but the next step to advance it is to beat the Official A-rank tourney&#41;. However, about a week or two later, I went back and talked to Chiho...and got the scene with Philia. After that, the shop un-upgraded. Chiho went back to her old pose, and the new items went away. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t try to regain it &#40;I&#39;d saved a couple weeks prior, so I decided to just load and not risk losing it for good&#41;, but something to keep an eye out for.
