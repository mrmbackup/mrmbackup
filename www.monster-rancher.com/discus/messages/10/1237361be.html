 Reposted from GameFAQs.com with permission from the author, HagFish: <BR> <BR>In a fit of nervous energy, I tried to find my old playstation that last I knew had MR2 in it, but failed so attempted to see if MR1 would work on my emulator. Remarkably, I got CDs reading the way they should &#40;my Grey Wolf is named &#34;It works!&#34;&#41;, so started playing the game again. I knew the ins and outs of MR2, even made an excel spreadsheet to make methods automatically &#40;I could share if anyone wants&#41;, and quickly got bothered that I couldn&#39;t find an effective, cheap, no-lifespan-hits method anywhere. With a basic cheat addon program for my emulator, I pinpointed the addresses and discovered the mechanics of stress and fatigue. The item/food information was all posted on MRM long ago, but the fatigue amounts for various actions and the stress / fatigue limits for lifespan hits were never found &#40;maybe just never posted&#41;. So, I&#39;ve found it all, and here we go &#40;I&#39;m boring you, I know&#41;: <BR> <BR>stress address: 800EBC79 <BR>light drill &#43;3 <BR>hard drill &#43;8 <BR>rest -8 <BR>1st barn upgrade -2/week <BR>2nd barn upgrade -4/week <BR>calm stone -5, 1st week of month only <BR>potato &#43;10 <BR>meat -10 <BR>mint leaf -50 <BR> <BR>stress warning &#40;1st week of month only&#41; at 40 <BR> <BR>fatigue address: 800EBC73 <BR>light drill &#43;18 <BR>hard drill &#43;33 <BR>rest -55 <BR>1st barn upgrade -2/week <BR>2nd barn upgrade -4/week <BR>fire stone -5, 1st week of month only <BR>mango -10 <BR>taffy -50 <BR> <BR>very well 0 <BR>is well 1-20 <BR>seems well 21-40 <BR>seems tired 41-60 <BR>very tired 61-79 <BR>very tired, give rest 80-95 <BR>too hard 96-100 <BR> <BR>lifespan remaining &#40;rolls over at 255&#41;: 800B88CC <BR> <BR>Alright, now for the &#40;hopefully&#41; never-before-seen stuff: Take your fatigue and stress after taking an action, but before any items, foods, or barn upgrades change them. <BR> <BR>If fatigue is 0-19: <BR>No lifespan hits with 0-39 stress <BR>1 lifespan hit with 40-59 stress <BR>2 lifespan hits with 60-79 stress <BR>3 lifespan hits with 80-99 stress <BR>4 lifespan hits with 100 stress <BR> <BR>If fatigue is 20-39: <BR>No lifespan hits with 0-29 stress <BR>1 lifespan hit with 30-49 stress <BR>2 lifespan hits with 50-69 stress <BR>3 lifespan hits with 70-89 stress <BR>4 lifespan hits with 90-100 stress <BR> <BR>If fatigue is 40-59: <BR>No lifespan hits with 0-19 stress <BR>1 lifespan hit with 20-39 stress <BR>2 lifespan hits with 40-59 stress <BR>3 lifespan hits with 60-79 stress <BR>4 lifespan hits with 80-99 stress <BR>5 lifespan hits with 100 stress <BR> <BR>If fatigue is 60-79: <BR>No lifespan hits with 0-9 stress <BR>1 lifespan hit with 10-29 stress <BR>2 lifespan hits with 30-49 stress <BR>3 lifespan hits with 50-69 stress <BR>4 lifespan hits with 70-89 stress <BR>5 lifespan hits with 90-100 stress <BR> <BR>If fatigue is 80-99: <BR>1 lifespan hit with 0-19 stress <BR>2 lifespan hits with 20-39 stress <BR>3 lifespan hits with 40-59 stress <BR>4 lifespan hits with 60-79 stress <BR>5 lifespan hits with 80-99 stress <BR>6 lifespan hits with 100 stress <BR> <BR>If fatigue is 100: <BR>1 lifespan hit with 0-9 stress <BR>2 lifespan hits with 10-29 stress <BR>3 lifespan hits with 30-49 stress <BR>4 lifespan hits with 50-69 stress <BR>5 lifespan hits with 70-89 stress <BR>6 lifespan hits with 90-100 stress <BR> <BR> <BR>One of the many interesting consequences? You can&#39;t do 2 hard drills in a row without something to reduce stress or fatigue between them and not take a lifespan hit. Anyway, I felt I may as well share some of my no-lifespan-hits methods, just for general enlightenment: <BR> <BR>If you have the second barn upgrade, you can do hard drills on the 1st, 3rd, and 4th weeks of every month, rest on the 2nd week, give 3 mangoes on the 4th week before drilling, and feed meat. No lifespan hits, no money spent. <BR> <BR>Or, if you have the second barn upgrade, calm stone and fire stone, you can do hard drills on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th weeks, a light drill on the 3rd week, give taffy on the 2nd and 4th weeks before drilling, and feed meat. No lifespan hits, only 150 G spent per month. <BR> <BR>Hopefully this&#39;ll let people play smarter, and raise monsters efficiently without resorting to the brute force &#34;feed taffy and mint every week&#34; method. Sure, it&#39;s been a while, but it&#39;s still fun, am I right?
