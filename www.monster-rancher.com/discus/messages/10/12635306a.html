 I recently began using a no-rest training method with my Monsters, and they became invariably more powerful due to the increased Fear and Spoil from the Mint Leaves, Taffys and Mangos they regularly ate, &#40;and from being home on the first weak every month for the Calm/Fire Stones and Meat&#41;. They reached S grade much earlier than before and regularly max several stats, where three maxxed stats was once a barely attainable goal for most Monsters.  <BR> <BR>Raising Style obviously indicates how even fear and spoil are, but 100 loyalty means almost nothing in terms of fear/spoil. About the only way to tell is to notice how well your monster trains on average and especially how easily the style shifts away from &#39;even&#39;.  <BR> <BR> <BR>I have no raw numbers to give, since I never learned to use my Game Shark very well, PS1 is broken, and even stat-totals are affected by breed. I&#39;m merely observing. What little information there is seems to be whats listed in the Item Values here on the site &#40;very, very useful stuff, btw&#41;. Besides those numbers, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any data on Fear and Spoil at all - it isn&#39;t even mentioned.

 I decided to dust off Monster Rancher and goof around with it a few days ago, and while re-learning all about the mechanics of the game and low-lifespan-loss training, I decided to perform an experiment concerning Fear and Spoil. Previously, while raising monsters using a no-rest method involving training and lots and lots of taffy and mint, I’d noticed that my monsters were gaining unusually high numbers while training &#40;and while working, when I paused training to do battle&#41;. A couple of hengers even got 10s &#40;20s in training&#41; on their highest statgain &#40;Skill&#41; during their prime, which was higher than I’d ever seen before.  <BR> <BR>Today, I decided to test the affect of very high Fear and Spoil &#40;together&#41; on a baby monster straight from the shrine, just to see what it’d do. I only tested one monster, a Rover from the MR1 disk, who I named Fluffy. After taking him to the ranch, I made two saves: one before I did anything else, and another after I fed him 100 mangos &#40;theoretically enough to raise both Fear and Spoil to 100, although you can’t see this data in-game and I don’t have any nifty tools to check it with&#41;. Then I raised Fluffy for 11 weeks, reloaded, and repeated, focusing on a different stat each time, and recorded my results.  <BR> <BR>Fluffy after 100 mangos:  <BR> <BR>100 Mangos -- Cart <BR>wk 1 Work: &#43;5 Power <BR>wk 2 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 3 Rest <BR>wk 4 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 5 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 6 Rest <BR>wk 7 Work: &#43;5 Power <BR>wk 8 Work: &#43;5 Power <BR>wk 9 Rest <BR>wk 10 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 11 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 12 End <BR>  <BR>100 Mangos -- Hunt <BR>wk 1 Work: &#43;7 Skill <BR>wk 2 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 3 Rest <BR>wk 4 Work: &#43;7 Skill <BR>wk 5 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 6 Rest <BR>wk 7 Work: &#43;7 Skill <BR>wk 8 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 9 Rest <BR>wk 10 Work: &#43;7 Skill <BR>wk 11 Work: &#43;7 Skill <BR>wk 12 End <BR>  <BR>100 Mangos -- Logging <BR>wk 1 Work: &#43;3 Life <BR>wk 2 Work: &#43;4 Life <BR>wk 3 Rest <BR>wk 4 Work: &#43;4 Life <BR>wk 5 Work: &#43;4 Life <BR>wk 6 Rest <BR>wk 7 Work: &#43;4 Life <BR>wk 8 Work: &#43;4 Life <BR>wk 9 Rest <BR>wk 10 Work: &#43;4 Life <BR>wk 11 Work: &#43;3 Life <BR>wk 12 End <BR> <BR>100 Mangos -- Guard #1 <BR>wk 1 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 2 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 3 Rest <BR>wk 4 Work: &#43;3 Defense <BR>wk 5 Work: &#43;3 Defense <BR>wk 6 Rest <BR>wk 7 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 8 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 9 Rest <BR>wk 10 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 11 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 12 End <BR> <BR>100 Mangos -- Guard #2 <BR>wk 1 Work: &#43;3 Defense <BR>wk 2 Work: &#43;3 Defense <BR>wk 3 Rest <BR>wk 4 Work: &#43;3 Defense <BR>wk 5 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 6 Rest <BR>wk 7 Work: &#43;3 Defense <BR>wk 8 Work: &#43;3 Defense <BR>wk 9 Rest <BR>wk 10 Work: &#43;3 Defense <BR>wk 11 Work: &#43;3 Defense <BR>wk 12 End <BR> <BR>Fluffy without any items, saving &#40;on a third save&#41; before each week of work and reloading on failures: <BR> <BR>No Items -- Cart  <BR>wk 1 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 2 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 3 Rest <BR>wk 4 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 5 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 6 Rest <BR>wk 7 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 8 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 9 Rest <BR>wk 10 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 11 Work: &#43;4 Power <BR>wk 12 End <BR>  <BR>No Items -- Hunt  <BR>wk 1 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 2 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 3 Rest <BR>wk 4 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 5 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 6 Rest <BR>wk 7 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 8 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 9 Rest <BR>wk 10 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 11 Work: &#43;6 Skill <BR>wk 12 End <BR>  <BR>No Items -- Guard  <BR>wk 1 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 2 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 3 Rest <BR>wk 4 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 5 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 6 Rest <BR>wk 7 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 8 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 9 Rest <BR>wk 10 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 11 Work: &#43;2 Defense <BR>wk 12 End <BR> <BR>These tests were performed on a game with only the first house and stable upgrades, and no items in the inventory. I rested every couple of weeks to avoid excess fatigue &#40;or stress&#41; coloring my results, although this resulted in excess spoil on the No Items test. In all tests, Fluffy was fed meat at the beginning of week 4, 8, and 12. He got larger at the beginning of the 11th week.  <BR> <BR>During the No Items test, Fluffy failed a good bit: 8 times during the Cart test &#40;5 of them on the 2nd week&#41;, 10 times during the Hunt test, and oddly only 3 times during the Guard test. After that, my patience ran out, but the results mirrored those of every baby monster I’ve ever raised, except for the failure counts, which appeared reversed from my usual experience but were probably completely random. By the end of these tests, Fluffy always had 23 loyalty and was on Easy &#40;which he reached on week 7, at 11 loyalty&#41;.  <BR> <BR>During the 100 Mango tests, he never failed, and his loyalty and raising style remained steady at 100 and Even, respectively. Mango-fed Fluffy routinely gained higher on his work than any baby monster I’ve ever raised, which supports my hypothesis that having very high Fear and Spoil improves work and training results. As I only tested one monster and did so less than ten times, this isn’t exactly prime research, and I probably won’t get around to more thorough testing; nobody really plays MR1 anymore. <BR> <BR>I did notice one other thing during my tests, which I found odd. Whenever I loaded from my No Items save, Fluffy was always “Very Well”. However, when I loaded from my 100 Mangos save, Fluffy was always “Is Well”. In fact, after my tests I went and fed him two mints and a taffy, saved, and loaded again – and he was still only “Is Well”. Perhaps this has something to do with stuffing Fluffy with 103 items in a single week, but so far I’ve found no mention of such a mechanic.
