<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
I have just spent about a week of my spare time studying Worms and the Worm cocooning event. My original goal was to determine the lifespan of Worms for the lifespans chart in the FAQ section. I discovered how easy Worm hatching really is, and its benefits, so I explored a little more. &#40;And, I&#39;m now deriving lifespans for all the hatched breeds.&#41; <BR>Here are the basics: <BR> <BR><B>Your Worm can be born on any week.</B> That&#39;s correct. I got several worms to cocoon that were born on a variety of weeks.  <BR> <BR>The breed it hatches into has no bearing on lifespan. I created a worm by comboing 2 from a CD, born on July 1. I saved my game a month before the cocoon event. Then I hatched over and over, raising the resultant offpsring. All of them got their retirement warnings on the same week. So, clearly breed has no effect on lifespan.  <BR> <BR>However, one weird fact:  <BR> <BR>The Worm I raised that was born on May 3 has its hatched offspring live a total number of 15 weeks longer than the monster born on July 1. &#40;I thought that being born on July 1 would give the monster almost an extra year of life compared to one born in June.&#41; It turns out that there is some sort of lifespan formula based on the Worm&#39;s birthday. The lifespan does not &#34;reset&#34; after cocooning. &#40;It&#39;s still much greater than an un-cocooned worm!&#41; <BR> <BR>Born: May 3, Lived 9y/5m/2wks  <BR>Born: July1, Lived 9y/1m/3wks  <BR> <BR>This 3m/3w difference is very weird, but is hard wired into each worm regardless of what it hatched into. &#40;and its all better than an unhatched worm which has a total possible lifespan of 7y/3w.&#41; The major difference I saw was that the mid-life warning &#34;Most Important Stage&#34; happened in the worms born in July before they cocooned, it happened after cocooning in the ones born in May.  <BR> <BR> <BR><B>Your hatched monster with a Worm sub-breed has a longer lifespan than a worm that never cocoons.</B> Check the FAQ section, &#34;Lifespans of All Pure-Breed Monsters&#34; for a chart showing lifespans for these monsters.  <BR> <BR><B>Your Monster will Cocoon on week 4 of June, if it is &#34;Very Well&#34; and has no stress or fatigue</B> My test monsters were simply rested every week of their lives, and cocooned every time. However, in experiments, simply doing a light drill &#40;the only one their entire life!&#41; on June 3 meant that the Worm did not cocoon. My personal recommendadtion is to rest on Week 2 &amp; 3 of June and, just to be certain, feed 2 Mint, 2 Taffy on Week 3. <BR> <BR><B>Your Worm&#39;s stats will carry over, and so will the techs -with tech transformations based on breed.</B> Nate Railsback&#39;s recommendation of raising the stats Worms learn easily, if you are going for an opposite type monster, is great advice. <BR> <BR><B>There are 7 main breeds you can get.</B> They are: Gali, Golem, Hare, Jell, Monol, Naga, Pixie. <BR> <BR><B>Main breed you get is random.</B> So far, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a pattern to this, I just keep getting all the types. &#40;So far, out of 28 tries I have gotten: 3 Hare, 4 Pixie, 4 Jell, 2 Naga, 7 Monol, 4 Gali, 4 Golem.&#41; I think the rationale for the breeds you get as a result of cocooning is something like this: there are 20 mains in the game, 8 of which are made by accomplishing something in gameplay &#40;thus not to be made too easy to get any other way&#41; and 3 are available in the Market. So, all the rest are available through cocooning -except plant and disc. Now, when you shrine a disc, you are first told your shrining was a dud, then the guy says that you just got the soul of a monster, they are a bit special. As for plant, maybe it just seemed too weird, or they forgot about it! <BR> <BR><B>The sub-breed is always Worm.</B> this means that monsters with no Worm sub-breed &#40;Ape, Doodle, Disc, Dragon, Ghost, Henger, Magic, Nya&#41; will never be created by hatching. It never hatches into a Worm, either. &#40;leaving 11 breeds, theoretically, to transform into, however, I have only seen 7 breeds emerge. <BR> <BR><B>Possible Breeds:</B> <BR>Gali/Worm <BR>Golem/Worm <BR>Hare/Worm <BR>Jell/Worm  <BR>Monol/Worm <BR>Naga/Worm <BR>Pixie/Worm  <BR>That&#39;s it, no other breeds are possible. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps anyone who may be contemplating raising a Worm. <BR>My other basic recommendations are to simply read the FAQ post on Items Values, and create your method based on that. I personally would feed Meat every month, and two Mint &amp; 2 Taffy each week, while focusing on HD. The lifespan boost by the Meat, coupled with the elimination of rest should get you a champion fairly quickly, without having to resort to more complex methods, like DP&#39;s MR1 mehod.

 Will a worm hatch if it fights in battles or goes to errantries &#40;training&#41;? Or does it have to be low stress/fatique it&#39;s whole life?

 Just low stress on week 3 of June in its 3rd year of life.
