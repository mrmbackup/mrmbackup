 Hello one and all, last time I played MR1 was before there were known values for stress, fatigue, lifespan hits, and so on, and I&#39;ve never had a gameshark or anything of the sort to find these values for myself.  <BR> <BR>Now, though, in honour of my recently changed name, I have deleted ALL of my monster rancher saves and will be playing each game again - I&#39;ve already gone through MR2 and am starting on a new run of MR1 now.  <BR> <BR>I was happy to find that there are known numbers for MR1 now, but there is very little in the way of recorded methods in the archives. Since I&#39;m starting fresh, I decided to do a bit of math and figure out a few methods that work with the numbers available. Some of these may have fallen into the sphere of &#34;Common knowledge&#34; but as far as I can tell they are not laid out in detail for new ranchers anywhere around here. <BR> <BR>I think Lisa&#39;s &#34;The Shock Treatment&#34; is probably the best freezer method possible, so I will not be venturing into freezer methods, as that is a solved problem.  <BR>Lisa&#39;s method: <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 1 Archive &#40;PSOne&#41;: Raising Methods: The Shock Treatment: 21st Century Technology For MR1 Monsters  <BR> <BR>Chessmaster Vex and Leon both mention Methods that rely on the in-game Training that are reasonably good in this thread - Note I can not find numbers for training effect on Stress, Fatigue, or lifespan, so I won&#39;t be touching on such methods in this post: <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 1 Archive &#40;PSOne&#41;: Miscellaneous Q&amp;A &#40;Post New Questions Here&#41;: Stats Question   <BR> <BR>Item values &#40;Form, Stress, Fatigue, Spoil, Fear&#41; from: <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 1 Archive &#40;PSOne&#41;: FAQ &#40;Required Reading!&#41;: Items Values &#40;New!&#41;  <BR> <BR>First, some abbreviations: <BR>LD or LW = Light Work <BR>HD or HW = Hard Work <BR>CS = Calm Stone <BR>FS = Fire Stone <BR>S = Stress <BR>F = Fatigue <BR>Wk = Week <BR>Mo = Month <BR> <BR>Now, some important numbers from HagFish for quick reference:  <BR>LW = &#43;3 S / &#43;18 F <BR>HW = &#43;8 S / &#43;33 F <BR>Rest = -8 S / -55 F <BR>1st Barn upgrade = -2 S / -2 F &#40;Per Week&#41;  <BR>2nd Barn Upgrade = -4 S / -4 F &#40;Per Week&#41; <BR> <BR>Lifespan hits: <BR>If fatigue is 0-19: No lifespan hits with 0-39 stress  <BR>If fatigue is 20-39: No lifespan hits with 0-29 stress  <BR>If fatigue is 40-59: No lifespan hits with 0-19 stress  <BR>If fatigue is 60-79: No lifespan hits with 0-9 stress  <BR> <BR>SOURCE: Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 1 Archive &#40;PSOne&#41;: FAQ &#40;Required Reading!&#41;: Stress &amp; Fatigue Numbers and Details by HagFish <BR> <BR>And the important Food &amp; Item values, for quick reference: <BR>Meat: -10 S / &#43;3 Spoil / &#43;6 Form / &#43;1 Week lifespan / <BR>Taffy: -50 F / &#43;2 Spoil / &#43;2 Form <BR>Mint:  -50 S / -2 Spoil / -2 Form <BR>Mango: -10F / &#43;1 Fear / &#43;1 Spoil <BR>Gold Peach: &#43;50 Week Lifespan <BR>Plant Egg: &#43;25 Week Lifespan <BR> <BR>SOURCE: Monster Rancher Metropolis: Monster Rancher 1 Archive &#40;PSOne&#41;: FAQ &#40;Required Reading!&#41;: Items Values &#40;New!&#41;  <BR> <BR>Additional info gotten from playing the game itself, for quick reference: <BR>HW = &#43;150g per successful drill <BR>LW = &#43;100g per successful drill <BR>Training= -2000g per month of drill <BR> <BR>Okay, enough of old information, onto the application of these numbers!

Since we lack any numbers for training &#40;that I can find&#41;, I always Feed meat and give 2 Taffy and 2 Mint when the monster returns from training, to insure they are in perfect condition to get back to work.  <BR>The total cost for a month of training, including the mint, meat, and taffy, and assuming no discounts, is at least 3100G per month &#40;400 for 2 Taffy, 400 for 2 Mint, 300 for Meat, and 2000 for Training itself&#41;. <BR> <BR>Regarding Peaches and Plant Eggs: <BR>Feed Gold peaches 50 weeks after prime starts &#40;or if you can&#39;t tell when prime started, 50 weeks from the &#34;important time&#34; type comments from Holly&#41; <BR>Feed Plant Eggs 25 Weeks after prime starts. <BR>Remember that they work by turning back the clock, so when you give the gold peach at 50 weeks after prime starts, you will essentially be back to day 1 of the monsters prime, so adjust future peach and plant egg feedings accordingly.  <BR> <BR>Notice that all of my methods use meat, I am firmly of the belief that you should ALWAYS feed a monster meat, the extra week of lifespan and reduced stress more than makes up for the cost, and even if you have a very tight budget, method 4: Breaking Even will stretch even the beginning 3000G from a new file long enough for your monster to start winning Rank E matches reliably and make a profit, unless you get just absurdly unlucky. <BR> <BR>As for my personal recommendation, I use all of them for various things depending on my budget and how much real-life time I want to put into raising a monster. Even method 4:Breaking Even can have good results, I currently have a 1st generation worm at 5years 11months old who was raised with that method, he is A rank, unlocked the Dragon for me, and has yet to receive a retirement warning. <BR> <BR>Well, I hope my work here helps some ranchers who have decided to come back to this game as I have, or those who are new! <BR>And sorry if I went on a bit long. <BR> <BR>-Jenni

 I missed a couple things when I was reading this over before posting - some much needed corrections:  <BR> <BR>For Method 1b: Proper MR2 Style <BR>Month 2 Feed the fatigue should be 49, not 24. This doesn&#39;t actually change anything significantly &#40;Still no lifespan hits etc.&#41;.  <BR> <BR>For Method 2: Hard Work life <BR>month 1 week 3 and month 2 week 3 the stress should be 24, not 22. This does not actually change anything significantly either.  <BR> <BR>For Method 3: Living Light <BR>I really screwed this one up -  <BR>month 1 week 2 and month 2 week 2 should have a mango. I also forgot to subtract for the barn upgrades. <BR>that means &#43;1 spoil per month &#43;1 Fear per month and -50 more gold per month. <BR> <BR>The new numbers for that section &#40;done correctly this time&#41; is:  <BR> <BR>Method 3: Living Light: <BR>Requirements: 1st Barn upgrade &#40;Fire Stone should work too, but the math is for the barn upgrade&#41; <BR>-- Mo 1-- <BR>Feed: Meat / &#43;3 Spoil, &#43;6 Form <BR>Wk1: LW / - = 3S, 18F = No Lifespan Loss / - <BR>Wk2: LW / Mango = 4S, 24F = No Lifespan Loss / &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear <BR>Wk3: LW / Mango = 5S, 30F = No Lifespan Loss / &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear <BR>Wk4: LW / Taffy, Mint = 3S, 18F = No Lifespan Loss / - <BR>-- Mo 2-- <BR>Feed: Meat = 0S, 18F = No Lifespan Loss / &#43;3 Spoil, &#43;6 Form <BR>Wk1: LW / - = 3S, 34F = No Lifespan Loss / - <BR>Wk2: LW / Mango = 4S, 40F = No Lifespan Loss / &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear <BR>Wk3: LW / Mango = 5S, 46F = No Lifespan Loss / &#43;1 Spoil, &#43;1 Fear <BR>Wk4: LW / Taffy, Mint = 3S, 18F = No Lifespan Loss / - <BR> <BR>^ Numbers repeat  <BR> <BR>Spoil: &#43;5 Per Month <BR>Fear: &#43;2 Per Month <BR>Form: &#43;6 Per Month <BR>Money: -100g Per Month  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m very very sorry about that, and I can&#39;t seem to find a way to edit an existing post I&#39;ve made to correct it there, the math is right in my notes from what I can tell, but typing it all out and reading it over I missed quite a few things, and noticed the errors when I was checking the thread for comments this morning. I&#39;m not the best at proofreading my own stuff, I tend to overlook stupid things.  <BR>again I am very sorry for the errors.  <BR> <BR>-Jenni
