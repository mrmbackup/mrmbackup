 Now, feel free to add to this information, since I&#39;m unfortunately not as certain about this one as I have been a lot of others. I&#39;ve done this three times. Got it to work once. Therefore, it&#39;s either chancy, or things have to be _PERFECT_ for it to happen. <BR> <BR>Get a worm of any sort. It doesn&#39;t neccessarily take a worm/worm, no matter what people insist &#40;I hatched a wing worm the one time I got it to work properly&#41;. The worm has to be born in April, and raised as carefully as possible. This means little to no stress, easy on the injuries, and keep it away from errantries where possible &#40;this may be where I made my mistakes, BTW&#41;. If you manage to do everything right, then after its three years old, make sure it&#39;s well-rested &#40;I.E. &#39;very well&#39;&#41;. In the first week of June, it will cocoon, and hatch out as a random worm-breed. In my case, it ended up being a golem/worm. <BR> <BR>A good way to get those hard-to-get part-worm critters. If it doesn&#39;t work, just reset and try again.

 i went on a hatching spree at the end of my mr1 days, and hatched quite a few worms.  every one of them hatched into an apparently random ____/worm mix.   <BR> <BR>btw, no one has specifically mentionned that the good thing about hatching in mr1, unlike the beaclon in mr2, is that the new creature was born with the stats of the worm, but with a brand new lifespan corresponding with the main type that hatched.  it was hard not to get a champion with a hatched monster...

 Not to mention that you could use it to get main-types with stats that are hard for them to work on, but easy for a Worm, such as a Tiger or Pixie inheriting the Worm&#39;s Power, Defense, and Life.

 I found this conflicting info on various websites. Any comments? <BR> <BR>Should be born on June 1st week, then on the 4th of June his 3rd year, he will hatch into a monster that will be random/worm. <BR> <BR>Should be born on the day of an official tournament. Cocoons on it&#39;s third birthday.

 here is what i know:  the worm must be 3 years old and very well on the 4th week of june.  most of my worms i had be born on june 1 and many, though not all, of them hatched.  a few worms that were born on other dates also hatched; more did not. &#91;i raised a lot of worms in mr1&#93;.  they need not be purebred.  although many of them hatched into a monster corresponding to the sub of the hatched worm, many did not.

 It also does not matter if it&#39;s a pure worm or a worm with another sub-type. They all work!

 Here&#39;s a new bit of info on the subject. I am raising one of each breed to determine lifespans, and I started Worm tonight. I took 2 off CDs and combined them right away. I then took the offspring to the ranch to simply rest until he died to fill out my chart. He was born on May 3, no real planning involved. He cocooned on week 4 of June at the age of 3/1/1, and transformed into a Hare. I have not finished him to see how long he lives. I guess I will do it at least once more to see if the lifespan varies, and the next one I raise will have a birthday in the fall, as far away as possible from June. The one thing I can confirm is that he was completely stress free, having only rested his whole life.

 Wow! I just got the &#34;most important stage&#34; announcement at 5y/8m/3w! &#40;At this point, I must recommend that people refer to the MR1 FAQ thread on monster lifespans, to understand my reference points.&#41; Looks like Torey was right about the monsters starting over lifespan-wise. If you subtract the monster&#39;s age at cocooning &#40;3/1/1&#41; from the &#34;most important stage warning&#34; you get 134 weeks, a good average for a monster with a regular lifespan. It is far better than pure-bred Hare &#40;which came in at 99wks&#41; but I guess that the Worm sub adds quite a bit to the formula. I&#39;ll post my final results as they happen. -And i plan on raising a few more of these &#40;hopefully they will cocoon into other breeds, or stay Worms so i can get more data.&#41;

 I&#39;ll create a Hoaxes, Myths &amp; Pranks post on what I now know to be untrue. &#40;Like the birthday thing&#41; Look for it in a day or so, as I get a few more bits of hard data.

 I wish I could remember what I found about this. Like Torey, I think it was that it has to be three, or near three, on the fourth week of June. &#40;Which happens to be a tournament&#41; The birth date didn&#39;t matter, though. Or at least, it can be born anywhere within that two months or so that you have leeway. <BR> <BR>Wait! I remember now! I froze the Worm, because I was trying to see if that would effect it. It hatched if I froze it for less than a month. &#40;In other words, if it was between three and three and three weeks. I couldn&#39;t test older than three&#41;  <BR> <BR>But if I tried to hatch it on one of the OTHER tournaments in the year, it would not. So I&#39;m guessing that you can take ANY Worm, of any birthday, freeze it and thaw it out so that it&#39;s third birthday falls on 4th June.

 I just raised a bunch of worms &#40;31 total so far&#41;, ranging from born on July1 to born on June1. All of them hatched on June 4 while they were 3 years old. Some were 3y/0m/3w, some were 3/11/m/3w. There were lifespan variations which seemed odd, but aside ffrom that, no variation on the date of cocooning. And, BTW, none of them cocooned on their birthday.

 Actually, that does make sense, since freezing the monster would reduce the age at which it would have hatched. I&#39;ll have to do some more experiments. I suspect it isn&#39;t the birthday that is important, its the age at hatching.
