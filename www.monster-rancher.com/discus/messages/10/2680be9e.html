 In an effort to see if drug use affected offspring, as so many people claimed <BR> on other message boards, I created a controlled experiment. I raised two <BR> pure Dinos from the same CD. I used the &#34;Vitamin D Trick&#34; from week two on <BR> both of them, so they only had one week of life without being &#34;drugged&#34;. I <BR> used mint and rest liberally, and they only did light drills, fed only fish. One <BR> lived 4 years 1 month, the other 4 years 3 months. I saved every week at <BR> the end of their lives, and went back and froze each in the week before they <BR> would have died. I combined them, and of course got another pure Dino. I <BR> put him on a regimen of resting on each &#34;seems well&#34;, or 2 weeks light drill, <BR> one week rest - with mint every other month on week 4, fed only fish. Like <BR> his parents, he did nothing else. One odd thing happened, at 3 years 8 <BR> months, instead of getting the &#34;he&#39;s at the most important stage&#34; notice, <BR> Holly said, &#34;Whether the monster becomes a good fighter or not depends on <BR> how you raise him&#34;. &#40;of course, he never fought a single battle&#41; I got the <BR> first retirement warning, &#34;he&#39;s tired and worn out&#34; at 6 years 5 months. His <BR> final lifespan was 7 years 5 months.  <BR> <BR> Clearly, vitamin/drug use does not affect offspring. I believe that in the <BR> past, before we knew a lot about MR2, no one really examined MR1 in depth. <BR> Most of the message boards were full of people bragging about impossible <BR> feats and spreading rumors about make-believe monsters. No one really had <BR> studied the life-span shortening effects of stress, and how the use of mint <BR> could improve raising methods. So most claims about item use were really <BR> just wishful thinking, or poor research.

 Good research Lisa. I&#39;m glad to see some people begin to chip away at MR1. I think there are probably a lot of things that we still don&#39;t know about MR1. I very seriously doubt that all the &#34;hidden&#34; secrets in MR2 were created solely for that game, but rather were also used in MR1, although perhaps not as many.

 I agree, Torey, and I&#39;m happy to see that the drug thing has FINALLY been tested!  We&#39;d been debating this for a while, but I&#39;m glad to see that you were right.  Now, I can start feeding them Vit D without worries &#40;It&#39;s not TECHNICALLY a bad drug.  Vit D is found in milk, you know :P&#41;. <BR> <BR>GREAT research, Lisa!  If you&#39;d care to know, I THINK I have discovered what all effects the adventures.  Should i post it, or would it be a waste, since we know the basics?
