 What was your best expedition where you made a lot of money from it?  For me, my best one was one of my recent expeditions in Hartville.  My maxxed out Teddy made 47k from his last trip to Hartville.  I am asking this b/c I am curious to know if anyone might have a much better, or similar experience with expeditions while being nice enough to reveal their methods to make money from them.  Meanwhile, I want to share my experiences with expeditions to help trainers who are going to be making monsters for them.   <BR> <BR>Let me start things off by saying Hartville &#40;sp?&#41; is the best place to go for exploring.  You can actually make over $40,000 from that area by going into a building that has a lot of valuable items.  However, it can be very tough to make over 40k there b/c monster can get lost regardless to it&#39;s int. level &#40;My maxxed out Teddy got lost a LOT of times in Hartville, and he had 999&#41; while some expeditions fail from the lack of good items &#40;e.g. you only find 12 herds&#41;. <BR> <BR>  Once you have a monster than can explore, Send your monster to Hartville in July, and go to the spot where Lisa has a red square with the number 2 on her map.  Take a monster with a descent power level that will smash the obstacle that blocks your way to building 2, and a very high intelligence level.  This building offers diamonds, emeralds, gold, medicine A, medicine B, Gali disc chips, and herbs so it is definitely worth checking out. <BR> <BR>Explore this area until you run out of time.  You should reset if: a&#41;your monster gets lost during the expedition &#40;even if you only had one day left, and you made $57,000, you could have found two diamonds on your last day if your monster did not get lost&#41;, or  b&#41;You got a lot of junk &#40;e.g. too many herbs which happens sometimes&#41;. <BR> <BR>Building 2 in Hartville is the best spot to go because of its location.  It only takes half a day to get there, and it gives you time to find emeralds, gold, and other valuable items.  When you are inside a building in an expedition, you have 2 chances to find stuff within that day.  In total, if you go somewhere within the very first day, you&#39;ll have 28 or 27 chances to find diamons, emeralds, etc.  I am not sure if Titus has any descent spots, and Reno can be obnoxious sometimes.   <BR> <BR>  To clarify my point, let&#39;s say that you&#39;re in Titus, and you go to a temple that took you six days to reach it.  Since you have eight days left due to the location of the building, you only have 16 or 15 chances to find stuff where as building 2 in Hartville gives you 27 chances to find valuable items. <BR> <BR>  Destorying the first obstacle that stands between you and building 2 gives you a quick route to help you find stuff.  There&#39;s another route to get there, but it consumes more time.  Once you get rid of that obstacle, you can simply raise Intelligence alone.  Just raise power with int. when you are going there for the first time. <BR> <BR>After you explored Hartville, rest your monster, or give it 2&#43; Taffy pieces and 2&#43; mint leaves, and freeze it until the next Hartville expedition.  I have a save file that has the stuff my Teddy found so you can e-mail me if you want to see it.  He made 47,000 from 3 medicine A bottles, 3 medicine B bottles, 2 emeralds, and 1 Gali Disc chip. <BR> <BR>  Let me warn everyone that it is NOT easy getting over $40,000&#43; in the Hartville expedition.  I probably resetted over 20 times when I explored Hartville with my monsters because I am trying to make 30-40k&#43; with my Teddy when I send him to Hartville.  It can be obnoxious to see a successful expedition where you make 25k&#43; within 4 days fail on the 5th day because your monster decides to get itself lost.  If you hate to use the reset button &#40;I can&#39;t blame you&#41;, stick to battles b/c you can actually make more from them if you have a good monster. <BR> <BR>Personally, I think it is somewhat better to constanly fight in all of the S-Class tourneys rather than going on expeditions.  You can make over 60k &#40;64k to be exact&#41; by winning every S-Class tourney without losing a single match.  Try this method if you&#39;re a trainer has a descent monster around the C-A classes &#40;A is alright, but S is better&#41;.  You could make more than 64k in Hartville, but you have to be very lucky to make that much money &#40;e.g. 7 diamonds, 9 emeralds, 12 gold bars, 14&#43; medicine A/B within those 14 days or so&#41;. <BR> <BR>Post your best expedition experiences while revealing your techniques to make money from them.  I hope my post will help people with expeditions.

 Thanks for the info, Gizmo the Lemur! In a good way, of course...  <BR> <BR>As a counter to getting lost &#40;but not a good money method&#41;, I often visited locales that were in proximity to others. If my monster failed to find anything in one building, I&#39;d pull him/her out &#40;though I never did raise a Pixie to explore&#41; and visit the next one, repeating the process. If an item was found, i.e: a Henger doll part, I would pull my monster out and revisit the area until he/she failed to find anything. However, this technique is better in Reno, which, as you said, CAN be obnoxious, but is a good method to find the Henger clay doll appendages. Sure, I scarcely made over 1000G in one expedition, but the best experience came from the result of 3 Hengers, 2 of which were very successful fighters. <BR> <BR>Sadly, as Hartville&#39;s very good buildings are a long distance from intersections, the technique described wastes valuable time... but it does preserve your monster should a key battle come up shortly after an expedition.
