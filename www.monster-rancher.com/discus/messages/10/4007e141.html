 Where do you find the plant eggs in mr1?? i bet they are in hartville but i never found them. Also is it possible to find a peach less than every 10 years? If possible i would like detailed instructions to the plant egg location.

 It&#39;s dificult to give precise directions to the &#34;Plant Egg&#34; in Hartville.  All I can say is it is in the upper left corner of the map, just slightly below and to the right of the giant statue that blocks the road.  As for your second question, I believe it was said that every monster may find one, and only one, &#34;Plant Egg&#34; and one &#34;Golden Peach.&#34;  There is no truth to the &#34;every 10 years&#34; legend.  However, you need above average intelligence of 400&#43; or so to even find one.  Once again, I recommend 700&#43; intelligence for an expedition monster. <BR> <BR>&#42;Note: Beware the effects of the &#34;Plant Egg&#34; and &#34;Golden Peach&#34; as they reduce loyalty by as much as 50! @_@&#42;

 Yeah, my second monster, a pure-breed Pixie got me my Master rank.  Of course, I new quite a lot about MR2 at the time.  Anyways, skill DOES help in expeditions.  It&#39;ll either help locate better items or help from getting lost in buildings.  As to which it is, I am uncertain.  I THINK it prevents getting lost, but I have no facts to back that up.  In short, both shoudl be at 700&#43; for a good expedition monster, but even at 999 int &amp; ski there is a 1% chance of getting lost.

 yeah ill just train in those, my serene actually got me my master ranking with quite poor stats. about 245 life, less than 80 power, 266 defense, 521 skill, 450 speed, and 637 intelligence. i guess i beat the magic at the tournament by withering all its will with firewall. &#40;the best move for a pixie in my opinion&#41;. I have not researched this but my angel &#40;my expedition monster&#41; has over 900 intelligence and about 500 skill. i usually never get lost &#40;about 5% of the time.&#41; this leads me to believe that quality of items is skill and getting lost is intelligence. Though i have nothing to back this up either

 There are Power obstacles, and nicely enough, once they are cleared away, they are gone forever. So, if you send a high Pow monster in a few times, you&#39;ll clean out everything -making way for a high Int monster to come in and find the goodies. I guess I am recommending two monsters for the job. <BR> <BR>As a rule of thumb, Int should be over 300 to find much of anything. I have found that overall, it&#39;s better to skip going if your monster isn&#39;t up to it, than to get lost and lose a few weeks after the expedition. <BR> <BR>As a side note, you might want to check out the FAQ section. I recently got a Tecmo authorised Japanese guide book for the game, and the items chart I posted shows some surprising info on what exactly foods and items do for you.

 I found my first and only so far plant egg at the very upper right corner in hartville at the end of the long hidden path &#40;which is also a very good place for other goodies such as emeralds, gold, and pink cd fragments&#41;. I send my expedition monster to that location every year and come back with around 20k-40k extra gold each time. &#40;i believe that hartville is the money-making expedition.&#41;

 Plant eggs... <BR> <BR>I remember when I gave my Henger one too many Plant Eggs/Golden Peaches too early in his life. It knocked him way back into the baby stage, his loyalty went all the way down to 30, and his gains dropped to the floor. I don&#39;t remember how old he was, anywhere from 1 to 4 I&#39;m guessing. I think that particular Henger lived to 10 years, IIRC... I&#39;ll have to go and check.
