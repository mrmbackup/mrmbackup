 After looking at the various drugs in MR1, I stumbled upon a great way to max out a monsters stats without your monster aging a week.  <BR> <BR>Is your monster going to die in 2 weeks? Want to mould your monsters stats as you see fit for an online tourney? Well then check this out. <BR> <BR>There are several drugs in the shop that become available after a certain amount of years, that actually increase stats instantly without taking up any time. Some raise stats by 20 and lower another by 10, some raise two stats by 10, and lower one by 10. Since giving your monster any amount of items each week is possible, you can literally MAX out several stats by giving them these drugs multiple times. <BR> <BR>Here is a list of these drugs and their effects: <BR>&#40;These effects may not agree with the official item values from Tecmo, but trust me, these are correct. I&#39;ve been using them all day&#41; <BR> <BR>Fly Pill: &#43;20 Speed -10 Defense <BR>Heart Pill: &#43;20 Skill -10 Power <BR>Vitamin A: &#43;10 Power &amp; Life -10 Skill <BR>Vitamin B: &#43;10 Defense &amp; Life -10 Speed <BR>Pill: &#43;10 Power &amp; Defense -10 Life <BR> <BR>Here is a great way to use these to your advantage, whether you want to pummel your friend to submission or want to get omptimum stats for an online tournament. <BR> After training your monster to its retirement warnings, save it and give your monster loads and loads of these pills. Don&#39;t fear my friend of drug over-dose, the lifespan loss doesn&#39;t matter, because your going to freeze it after your done anyway. Although these drugs lower some stats, there are some ways to get around it. <BR> <BR>- Take for instance Vitamin B; if you want your monster to be a tank, dont worry about this drug&#39;s side effect, because with max life and defense you don&#39;t really plan on dodging any attacks.  <BR> <BR>- Vitamin A has a harsh side effect of lowering skill by 10, so just cancel this out by giving your monster a Heart Pill for each Vitamin A. A combo of these two items can potentially max out life and skill in 1 week.  <BR> <BR>- If you plan on maxing out life and speed, you can use the combination of Vitamin B and Fly Pill. Create a speeder with high life! <BR> <BR>I tested this method of maxing stats on my 8 year old Pull Worm and 170,000G later here is what I got: <BR> <BR>Before               After <BR> <BR>Lif: 798 -----------&#62; 999 <BR>Pow: 867 -----------&#62; 950&#43; <BR>Def: 906 -----------&#62; 950&#43; <BR>Ski: 706 -----------&#62; 950&#43; <BR>Spd: 101 -----------&#62;   1 &#40;who cares? lol&#41; <BR>Int: 130 -----------&#62; 130 <BR> <BR>The best thing to do after drugging your monster is to save on a different file, specifically for battling. You may want to battle your un-drugged monster later or do other things with the rest of its life, and plus you may want to keep all the money you spent. Although the benifits of this method are beyond godly, it comes at a price... <BR> <BR>- You&#39;ve practically killed your monster <BR>- Empties your wallet <BR>- You need to create a new save for it <BR>- Time consuming <BR> <BR>Despite these negative points, altogether I&#39;d say this is a great way to prepare your monster for any online tournament, or to wow your friends. Remember to make use of those near-retired monsters!

 I thought of it, and &#40;back when I still didn&#39;t know how to make monsters last&#41; had a very dissappointing Hare/Suezo that was about to die at 2.5 years.  So I realized this potential, and started dumping pills into him to bring his Life and Defense to the levels I wanted-- though I eventually quit because it was costing me too much.  Later I came back to the game and raised me a REAL Hare.

 I did this to a tiger a long time ago.  sure, he maxxed, didn&#39;t take long.  but a couple things urked me about it. <BR> <BR>1. it felt cheap, like I didn&#39;t really raise a monster <BR>2. it was pretty expensive, drained my acct pretty fast, good thing I had another save. <BR>3. it was super boring <BR> <BR>not bagging on toado or anything, just my pov.

 I don&#39;t think it&#39;s boring at all...  <BR>I think it&#39;s actually kinda fun thinking which items your gonna use to cancel out the negative effects of others, and see how everything turns out. It can&#39;t be more boring than the shock treatment...

 Most methods involving maxing usually involve a lot of tedious repetition. This one is no different, but at least there is no need to use dummy monsters and that kind of nonsense.

To argue against DB, you could make dummies useful...to an extent.  I mean, make them fight general tourneys for some quick cash, or if they are in C Class with 45&#43; fame &#40;pick a fight or two in the D-tourneys until it hits 40&#43;&#41;, and 300-500&#43; Int., send them to Hartville to make $30,000&#43; like I mentioned back in November <FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#40;though it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been on an expedition since my Teddy called it quits with exploring so don&#39;t quote me on the exp. until I do with my current dummy yet&#41;</FONT>.  That&#39;s what I did to make some chump change that would be immediately spent on taffies and mint leaves.

 Just wanted to note that to save cash do this on a &#34;sale&#34; week. When you need to use drugs in those quantities, the savings of 600 less per drug really add up quickly.
