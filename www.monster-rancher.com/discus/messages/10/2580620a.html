 Okay, I&#39;ve just about given up on finding another one of these.  I found my first GP in Reno, by accident.  I have never found another in that location, almost 100 years ago.  I have raised many expedition monsters to do teh job, but all get lost or only find &#34;Sting Dust&#34; and &#34;Jell Disc Chips.&#34;  I remember a thread where, I think it was Torey, said that he found all of his peaches in some sort of stadium-like structure.  Could somebody PLEASE confirm where they are located, so I can continue my research and ultimately break the 9 year mark &#40;8.5 is my current record, though I have not raised my Henger, yet.&#41; <BR> <BR>While I have your attention, what is the difference between a &#34;Wind Whistle&#34; and a &#34;Clam Stone&#34; I have three &#34;Wind Whistles&#34; and two &#34;Calm Stones,&#34; and am not certain which ones to sell, if any.  Also, does the &#34;Wind Drum&#34; concentration mean that the monster will receive better stat acquisition?  Finally, does any body know for certain if the lifespan hit from &#34;Vitamin D&#34; really DOES effect the lifespan of the offspring of the drugged monster? <BR> <BR>Thank you for all of your help in advance.

 Keep both the Wind Whistle and the Calm Stone. Both make your monster better off. Just leave them in inventory.  <BR> <BR>I got all my Gold Peaches from exactly the same structure. It does take a monster with a huge INT. I had my best luck with a Pixie whose INT was about 800. I used to freeze her for a year between adventures while I trained other monsters, unfreeze her, send her to Reno, get a peach or two, then freeze her again.

 let me see...you turn left, then right up the far right side of the trail.  take the first right, then the first right off of that trail.  there should be one round building at the end of that trail.  go there every year - from what i remember, years between xxx6 and xxx9 are especially fruitful for some reason.

 OH!  The &#34;Disc Shrine.&#34;  Thank you for those directions, Torey.  I was even looking in the wrong place, it seems. ^_^

 The Wind Drum&#39;s &#34;concentration&#34; means that you have a better chance of learning moves from Training.  That&#39;s what the game counsellor at Tecmo told me two years ago.

 Thanks Nate, I was wondering what it meant.  MR1&#39;s layout is not as balanced as MR2&#39;s, but it definitely has its&#39; strong points! ^_^
