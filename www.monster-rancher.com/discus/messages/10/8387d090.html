<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
Looking over our site and many others today, I was struck by the lack of certain monsters on CD. While chatting, hengersrock mentioned that he didn&#39;t think you could get any of the monsters that you unlock in the game off CD except their rares. &#40;Ape, Doodle, Dragon, Ghost, Henger, Magic, Nya, and maybe Disc -even though it&#39;s not locked&#41; This fits neatly with the complete lack of certain types from almost everyone&#39;s CD lists on the web. <BR> <BR>Now, I have been going through the CD list at MRM, and we have one entry for a monster on that list, posted by someone who is long gone. I am looking for people to confirm or deny that this disc works: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Monster</TD><TD>Disc</TD><TD>Posted by </TD></TR><TR><TD>Henger/Dino</TD><TD>Syphon Filter &#40;Playstation&#41;</TD><TD>kyle topham</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>If anyone can prove, via posting the subcode in the Laboratory section of the site, that they have a CD making a non-rare, Ape, Doodle, Dragon, Ghost, Henger, Magic, Nya, or Disc, then maybe they are available on CD. If no proof arises in a few months, I will close the sections and declare unavailable except in-game via either items or combinations.

 well, i know syphon filter is a popular game a lot of people have it, &#40;i dont however&#41;, so it shouldnt be too difficult to test.  You can also rent it&#40; i will if no one posts it&#41;.

 Might this be why that save was included on the Underground Jampack?

Yeah it explains the Disk monster being on the Jampack. We did have one entry for the Disk/Disk which I deleted because it was posted by the &#34;Cheeze&#34;, someone who got banned for posting a lot of other bad info, etc. His entry said <I>&#39;Ratt, &#34;Spin Me Round&#34; first pressing only&#39;</I>. I looked other places and did not see any confirmation, nor could I find a separate CD by that name. I know Ratt&#39;s big 80&#39;s hit was &#34;Round and Round&#34; off the &#34;Out Of The Cellar&#34; album.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to see any CDs making any of these monsters, really!

 And, one more additional point, there are a total of 28 types I am talking about here. Thats a lot out of 215 total. It seems like one of us &#40;Even amongst the regulars here at MRM we must have at least close to 10,000 CDs or more; the online lists I checked represent about another 10,000 discs.&#41; and for none of to have found even one of these 28 types is very compelling.

 One last &#34;bump&#34; to this topic. Without compelling evidence otherwise, I will be closing off the appropriate sections of the CD list, and adopting the above observation as a fact about the game. -Will prbably start re-doing the site tomorrow.

 Just a quick question. What if somebody latter on finds those monsters on some CDs? How will they be able to post them if the sections are closed? <BR> <BR>But I do agree that it is odd that nobody has found at least one CD yet that makes a Dragon or one of the other monsters listed.

 I will put up a note, asking them to post it in the General Q&amp;A section, and to post the subcode. We can always move posts into those areas.

 Could be because none of us have the game and don&#39;t want to buy or rent it just for a sub-breed monster.

 I have Syphon Filter, but I think my copy of MR1 is so scratched up i dont think it will work anymore.... <BR>I&#39;ll try it tomorrow though if I can get it out of my roommates room. <BR>I know it still works enough to make a sueki suezo, so I&#39;ll cross my fingers as too actually loading a game up.

 Also if you search for Syphon Filter Dragon_King you would have found it already listed in the Monster Rancher CD section under the dino listing.

 Ok, well, it&#39;s been quite a week. We now have conclusive proof that the chart the in-game system uses to make monsters cannot make pures for Ape, Disk, Dragon, Ghost, Henger, Magic, and Nya. <BR> <BR>Doodle has at least one CD that makes a pure for it, but we haven&#39;t found it yet. But we have working subcode in the Laboratory. <BR> <BR>Disk really cannot be made from CD, except the rares, and it might be a glitch. Doodle is 18 on the chart, and the ID for Disk is 19, so a programmer may have mis-typed the ID number when creating the data to have a CD make the monster. <BR> <BR>The Santa Claus monster really does have two hard-coded CDs that make it.  <BR> <BR>So, most mysteries solved, one remaining; what Cd makes a pure Doodle?

 Is there only going to be one specific cd that makes it, or will it be random like regular monsters &#40;such as Tiger, Suezo, Jell, etc&#41;?

 A little of both. Tecmo chooses one CD to represent each main type, then also sets things up so it can be found randomly. Catch is, no one who worked on this game&#39;s CD localization is still with the company.  <BR> <BR>It would be a CD that was out in early 1997 or before, and fairly popular.
