Here&#39;s a list of common myths regarding worms and the process of hatching or cocooning them into other breeds: <BR> <BR>&#34;Should be born on June 1st week, then on the 4th of June his 3rd year, he will hatch into a monster that will be random/worm.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Should be born on the day of an official tournament. Cocoons on it&#39;s third birthday.&#34; <BR> <BR>Can only be a pure worm, or a particular breed is mentioned.  <BR> <BR>&#34;The week it&#39;s born does matter. I believe it has to the week of the official tourney in June/July&#40; haven&#39;t played in a while, I forget what month&#41;&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;No, it doesn&#39;t reset lifespan. Sorry&#34;  <BR> <BR>I am posting a new guide about worm hatching in the Worm section of the Monsters area. Check there for more real data.

 worms were always my favorite mr1 monster.  i think i remember a lot about them, and how they hatch.  it will be interesting to compare my misty water-colored memories with the reality of the whole subject.

 Well, this could explain why worm-hatching always seemed so hard to me! I have a Nintendo Power rep to slap around for a while, I see. Even he thought it had to be in June &#40;he said the first week&#41;, and that it&#39;d cocoon in the 4th of July. Although I&#39;m also almost positive that I heard it can cocoon into a worm/worm as well. Guess it makes sense, though, that a caterpillar can&#39;t cocoon into another caterpillar. <BR> <BR>Suddenly, I have this urge to get back into MR1 for a while, just to see how good a worm I can end up with. A few errantries, some good hard work, lots of mint and taffy in between, and voila!

 Why is worm hatching so good? why cant you just breed them? or even why cant you just get them off of cd&#39;s?

These monsters once hatched, start lifespans up all over again, making them the longest lived in the game. It&#39;s a great way to raise a champion without having to worry about peaches or plant eggs. <BR> <BR>Also, for those people who don&#39;t have a lot of CDs, its a way to get, say, a Pixie or two and then have breeding stock for a line of Pixies with no Pixie CDs in the house.

 Do the stat-gains match the monster, or do they stay &#39;set&#39; as a worm, as they do in MR2? Do you have to breed the monster to get it out of worm-mode?

 I don&#39;t know, Kurasu. I was simply resting them every week to discover the maximum lifespan. But, I would not be surprised to see that they are still set as &#34;Worm&#34;, attribute-wise. It&#39;s like that in MR2.

 I can vouch that stat gains are altered when they cocoon into, say a radar.  I had tried multiple worms in attempts to cocoon, and one day my 9 year old cousin came over, played 1 time and it worked.  went from a pure trained in skill, speed, and power.....turned into a radar power gains went right down, and skill and speed went up.
