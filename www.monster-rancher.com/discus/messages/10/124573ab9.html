 How do u guys raise the majority of a monster&#39;s stats?? Don&#39;t u use the &#34;training&#34; in the schedule? Or just simply use one of the vitamin d tricks or whatsoever...

 Vitamin D trick drastically reduces lifespan, so I don&#39;t use it. I generally raise whatever a monster is good at in babyhood and old age, and what it&#39;s bad at during prime. I like Hard Work, but it doesn&#39;t help every stat. Some people like to go to a lot of training because it gives good results. With my maxxed Golem, I just kept doing HW and LW until he was done. &#40;Check the Methods Section for my Method.&#41;

 I use a combination of tactics.  I&#39;ll just pick a  <BR>random month...June.  In June, I send my Angel  <BR>&#40;Who I am trying to max&#41; training.  When July  <BR>rolls around, I let her sleep on week one, do work  <BR>on weeks two and three, and rest on week four.   <BR>Then, in August, she goes off training. <BR> <BR>This is a rough life for a monster, in the long  <BR>run.  I got the middle-aged message on my Dixie at  <BR>only 1 year, 7 months while using this tactic.   <BR>So, to keep Angela &#40;the Angel&#41; alive, I give her  <BR>meat each month, and Golden Peaches on her  <BR>birthday.  Which means she lives in the freezer  <BR>for 20-25 years while I raise other monsters to go  <BR>questing for said peaches. <BR> <BR>&#40;Note:  High skill and intelligence are needed to  <BR>successfully find peaches, so I specialize in  <BR>Pixie and Gali breeds.&#41; <BR> <BR>This method is very costly, so you may wanna play  <BR>the game for a while, first.  I&#39;m at year 1136 or  <BR>so...and have almost 1,000,000 G to play with &#40;Me  <BR>likes the Hartville treks&#41;.  Much fun. <BR> <BR>And, with this method, Angela is now 20&#43; years  <BR>old, with maxed out Ski, Int, and Spd.  640 Life,  <BR>and Pow and Def in the 300&#39;s.  It takes a lot of  <BR>work, but it&#39;s worth it.  At least, worth it as  <BR>far as a game can be. <BR> <BR>Do think it&#39;s been easy though.  Raising a Pixie&#39;s  <BR>Pow and/or Def is almost as hard as raising a  <BR>Golem&#39;s Spd.  So, yeah, you will have some tough  <BR>times.  But, bear in mind, it&#39;s a game, and there  <BR>is always a way around hard stuff in games.  Be it  <BR>time, cash, whatever.  The best thing you can have  <BR>to raise your monsters well is determination! <BR> <BR>And a really boring social life helps too. :P

 I had a very simple method to max a henger&#39;s pow skill and spd, and got lif and def up to 450 each and I didnt bother with intellegence, so hes stuck in the frezer on the last week of his life pumped full of drugs with 999 in all stats but intellegence. It works for any monster, of course.  <BR>Here it is: <BR>Week 1: Feed meat, send off to training. <BR>Next month: Feed meat, 2 mint leaf, and 2 taffy. Send off to training. <BR>Next month: Repeat. <BR>Next month: Etc. <BR> <BR>I know it was a henger, but you can get any monster with maybe 3 stats at 600&#43; and you&#39;ll beat even Gabarn easily. <BR> <BR>Unlike in MR2, training won&#39;t decrease lifespan by more then the 4 weeks spent there unless you send at &#34;Seems well&#34; or below. <BR> <BR>Constant training takes care of tech aquisition. Even though this can get incredibly expensive &#40;Gerigon made a few hundred grand go down the pooper&#41;, you&#39;ll easily earn it all back and more once you freeze and use a dummy monster in between big 4 fights.
