 While catalogging my disk collection in MR1, I came across an interesting bit of knowledge, that at first, I dismissed as coincidence. <BR> <BR>Once oyu unlock a monster, it generally starts with three starting techniques.  Did you know that these techniques are somewaht flexible?  For example a Pure-breed Gali will always begin with &#34;Flash Bomb&#34; as one of its&#39; techniques, whereas, a Gara &#40;Gali/Monol&#41; will always get &#34;Demon Punch&#34; in its&#39; beginning move list.  Not a really powerful breakthrough, until I started comparing all of my other pure breeds with the sub-types.  A Suezo will begin with &#34;Lick,&#34; a Horn &#40;Suezo/Tiger&#41; will get &#34;Teleport,&#34; as will a Melon &#40;Suezo/Dino&#41;, but a Pink Eye &#40;Suezo/Pixie&#41; would receive &#34;Telepathy.&#34;  This brought me to wonder about why the Horn, clearly an intelligent-based sub-type, ended up with &#34;Teleport&#34; &#40;a clearly power-based technique&#41;. <BR> <BR>After looking over the similarities within them, I decided to check the stas...BINGO!  Horn and Melon have the highest stat as skill, whereas, Pink Eye had quite a larger gain in intelligence, granting it the &#34;Telepathy&#34; attack.  I continued this experiemtn with my Hare, Jell, and Tiger collection.  All pure-breed Hare would begin with &#34;Guru Guru,&#34; Buster would always start with &#34;Shriek,&#34; and my Amethyst began with &#34;Head Jab.&#34; <BR> <BR>Looking at the sats for my Hare, Buster, and Amethyst led me to another conclusion...sub-type.  It would appear that even though the pure Hare and Amethyst both had power as their main stat, they would receive different techniques.  Hence, the nature of the sub-type must play a part.  Naga is power-based and Pixie is intelligence-based. <BR> <BR>After cross-checking the Jell with the Icy &#40;Jell/Tiger&#41;, and getting &#34;Flyswatter&#34; vs. &#34;Slap,&#34; I concluded that I was right, but did one more test, just to make certain.  I cross-checked my Rover &#40;Hare/Tiger&#41; with a pure-breed.  The Rover started with &#34;One-Two,&#34; a power tech.  My pure breed Tiger, on the other hand, would always have &#34;Tackle,&#34; a skill tech. <BR> <BR>In short, it would seem that there are three different starting techniques for a monster, as well as four factors that determine which will be gotten. <BR> <BR>1.&#41;  The sub-type of the monster. <BR> <BR>2.&#41;  The power/intelligence base of the sub-type <BR> <BR>3.&#41;  The highest starting stat of the particular species. <BR> <BR>4.&#41;  What the sub-type specialises in &#40;i.e. Tiger in skill, Hare in power, Monol in defense&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>I have tested over 110 disks this way.  I am confident that I know what I&#39;m talking about.
