<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
Ever since I got the books from Japan, and saw all the data that US ranchers had never been able to access, I have been thinking about working on a method to take advantage of of the information. From the first day, Dark Phoenix, was an inspiration and a great help. It was he who suggested, on that first night in chat, that it would be great to just raise a monster on week 4 and feed meat. Well, I thought about it, worked on some problems &#40;and played another little game called Monster Farm 3&#41; and devised a no-rest method that really works well.  <BR> <BR>This method is expensive, very expensive, as expensive as you can imagine a method ever being, because your monster will be immortal, and he&#39;s gonna get fed a lot of items. Be prepared. <BR> <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the Routine: <BR>&#40;M=Mint, T=Taffy, HW=Hard Work, LW=Light Work&#41; <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>No Items held in inventory. &#40;You could, but calm stone and fire stone have a minor effect, beneficial but minor. I prefer being able to buy more items at one time.&#41; <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>During the first year, use a dummy monster in week 2&amp;3. Bring out your &#39;real&#39; monster for week 4&amp;1. All notation is for the &#39;real&#39; monster. <BR> <BR>Week 4: get from town, 2M/2T, HW <BR>Week 1: feed Meat, 2M/2T, HW, then 1M/1T, town &amp; freeze <BR>Holly will say the monster &#34;seems well on week 1 &amp; 2 this is ok, it will be &#34;well&#34; when it returns from town. <BR><CENTER><FONT COLOR="ff6000">&#42;&#42;&#42;</FONT></CENTER> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">&#42;</FONT>After year one, shift over to raising exclusively on week 4  <BR>&#40;except for training months to get techs, those are outlined below.&#41; <BR> <BR>HW Week 4: get from town, 2M/2T, HW, feed Meat, 1M/1T, town &amp; freeze <BR>Holly will say the monster &#34;seems well&#34; on week 1, this is ok, it will be &#34;well&#34; when it returns from town. <BR>-or &#40;occasionally, you need to do LD, just to get stats up -or to give yourself a breather&#41; <BR>LW Week 4: get from town, 1M/1T, LW, feed Meat, town &amp; freeze <BR> <BR>Training month: let the dummy go all the way through week 1-4, feed it, and freeze it. Bring your &#39;real&#39; monster out in Week 1. Feed 2M/2T, send to train, feed Meat, 2M/2T, town &amp; freeze. <BR><CENTER><FONT COLOR="ff6000">&#42;&#42;&#42;</FONT></CENTER> <BR>Basic Tips: <BR>&#42;Save Often -I save at least once a month, usually just before bringing my &#39;real&#39; monster out of the freezer. That way, if he were to fail, I can conveniently reset. &#40;Although, so far, i have not had a single failure.&#41; Occasionally the game itself freezes up, usually when going to or from town. Since you&#39;ll be doing this a lot, saving will prevent any major losses. <BR> <BR>&#42;It is essential to feed 1M/1T before going to town if the monster is &#39;seems well&#39;, and 2M/2T if tired or worse. There is some sort of calculation by the game in town that adds stress, and will tally up items used -if they are used just before the trip. I have several proofs on this one. Most of us have noted the additional stress along with the loyalty boost, and shift towards Firmness with repeated trips to town. Also, a very tired monster after a training month can simply be fed 2M/2T and be sent to town, frozen and return well, when a very tired monster who is frozen without items returns very tired. In weeks you do LW, you should not need the feeding before going to town, as you monster should be &#34;well&#34; after 1M/1T &amp; LD. <BR> <BR>&#42;I raise for 2 weeks in the monster&#39;s first year of life to help combat &#39;going to town stress&#39; and so that it ages a bit, making statgains improve. Face it, you could do just week 4 from birth, but then you&#39;d simply have a slow learning, 1-week-old monster! <BR> <BR>&#42;The 6 months of lifespan used up in year one, coupled with the 3 weeks used up per training trip should bring your monster closer to prime. If you have a monster that doesn&#39;t have a lot of techs, or you feel is just too far from prime, keep them on the ranch for as long as you like, just remember, keep up the M/T; 2 each on HW weeks, 1 each on LW weeks. -And your monster won&#39;t have to rest.  <BR> <BR>Results? <BR>So far, I have been raising the golem that MR2 makes in MR1. It has never rested, it has also never failed. I am only battling once I know I can breeze through an official tourney.

It got the &#34;Most Important Stage&#34; warning at 2y3mo. The monster in the chart above has not yet gotten the warning and it has not reached prime. As it stands, I can tread water indefinitely. I will keep adding to the chart as each year passes. &#40;slowly&#41; <BR> <BR><B>8/15/2001</B> Update: I got to the 14th birthday today, and decided that I was really tired of the working in week 4 routine, so I began sending him to to training to boost stats fast. As you can see, the jump from year 14 to 15 was very nice stat-wise, and it only took about an hour in real-life! &#40;unlike my average of 5-9 days per year before&#41; I got the &#34;most important stage&#34; warning at 14y 3mo. Now, while I would love to simply train until he&#39;s all maxxed, I am going to do some math and see just how much I really can squeeze in, because he only has 179 weeks to live after the warning.  <BR> <BR>My current plan for &#40;he just turned 15&#41; is to max out the Life &#40;currently at 943&#41; by doing LW, since he&#39;s just entering prime, it&#39;s as good a time as any, and far better than being stuck doing work in old age. I will then work on Speed, that being his worst attribute &#40;he&#39;s still only doing 6-8 per week in training in that one!&#41;, so he will get the full advantage of prime. After that, I will work on Skill and see how it goes. <BR> <BR>I have discovered that there is no difference between freezing between trainings, and simply sending them right back out after they come back. Each way they return as &#34;seems tired&#34;. I simply feed 2Mint and 2 Taffy before sending them out. Of course, I send on week 1, so they get a feeding of meat upon their return. &#40;That extra week of lifespan will be useful!&#41; <BR> <BR><B>12/27/2001 <BR>We have been getting a lot of messages about this method, most of them saying that people could max out monsters without it. Yes, you can max out monsters with Peaches &amp; Plant Eggs. They are time consuming to get, and that system has been known since 1997. <BR> <BR>At the time I posted the Items list seen in the FAQ section, people did not believe that Meat extended lifespan, and this method was the first real-life proof that it does extend lifespan. <BR>  <BR>This method isn&#39;t the only way to do things in MR1.  <BR> <BR>It <I>is</I> a no-rest method that does not involve having to go on expeditions to get items to carry it out.  <BR> <BR>Also, I used a Golem -a monster notoriously difficult to max because of its low statgain in Speed. Bragging that you maxxed a Henger is really no comparison.</B>

 Thanks for the kind words, torey! I can really only get through 4-6 months of his time a day right now, so I will be adding updates every 3-4 days. I am looking forward to maxxing him out soon, I don&#39;t know if I can stand to go for the full 23 years!  <BR> <BR>Also, for the record, he&#39;s still getting 3-4 in Skill and Speed, and 6s in Def, so those attributes will take some serious time to boost. I have gotten all the techs, so there&#39;s no real reason to do training any more. I could ude it to boost some stats, but at the risk of using lifespan.

 I started out rotating the 4 HD evenly. None of them reduces Int, but 2 raise it. Also, while rotating the HD, Def, Ski, and Spd all wound up gaining nothing in the long run. I was doing training then too, which helped boost some stats. In year 6 I shifted to all LD.  <BR> <BR>Once a few stats are maxxed, I might try a few trainings in Speed because he&#39;s only getting 2s on LD in Speed.  <BR> <BR>He still has not gotten the &#34;Most Important Stage&#34; warning, so I know I am simply re-living the same week over and over. At some point, maybe I will go back to drilling 2 weeks in a row; simply to hit prime and get better stagains. At least I currently have a lot of flexibility in my choices. <BR> <BR>I am also writing down all the birthday songs for a separate post.

Yes! Finally, a way to max a monster in this  <BR>game. I am most definitely going to give this  <BR>one a run, so I can continue my long-suffering  <BR>slating experiment.
