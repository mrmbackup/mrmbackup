I&#39;ve done a few combining experiments, and had some excellent results in terms of tech carryover! <BR>It all started while I was trying to pass time in the game before Vitamin D showed up. I raised 2 jells from the same CD. I didn&#39;t do anything special. &#40;My MR1 memory card had frozen, so I restarted the game at an early poverty-stricken stage.&#41; They battled a bit for money, went on training and lived 5y 8mo, and 5y 10mo respectively. I decided to combine them. They had 6 techs,Stab,Whip,Slap,Cannon,Flyswatter,and Insecticide. Their stats: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Life</TD><TD>Pow.</TD><TD>Int.</TD><TD>Skill</TD><TD>Speed</TD><TD>Def. </TD></TR><TR><TD>204</TD><TD>282</TD><TD>252</TD><TD>369</TD><TD>259</TD><TD>405 </TD></TR><TR><TD>234</TD><TD>272</TD><TD>242</TD><TD>339</TD><TD>273</TD><TD>381</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>I was warned that it was a bad combo. The results were: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Life</TD><TD>Pow.</TD><TD>Int.</TD><TD>Skill</TD><TD>Speed</TD><TD>Def. </TD></TR><TR><TD>100</TD><TD>90</TD><TD>189</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>90</TD><TD>130</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>-not too remarkable....until I looked at the techs. <B>All 6 had carried over!</B> <BR> <BR>Next I decided to raise that monster as a money maker and see about some more combos! I&#39;m in the middle of that right now, currently I&#39;m raising 2 plants to see how they combine with each other. However, occasionally I save my game and check on potential combos. Here are some mid-project reports. <BR>I raised the jell, had it aquire 1 more tech, and mostly used it as a money monster. I raised the first plant specifically to try and aquire techs. At three years I tried a combo for fun. The jell had 7 techs &#40;added spit&#41; and the plant had 5: Toxic Nectar, Jab, Steady Jab, Slap and Hook. <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>type</TD><TD>Life</TD><TD>Pow.</TD><TD>Int.</TD><TD>Skill</TD><TD>Speed</TD><TD>Def. </TD></TR><TR><TD>Jell</TD><TD>177</TD><TD>335</TD><TD>224</TD><TD>363</TD><TD>217</TD><TD>220 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Plant</TD><TD>224</TD><TD>280</TD><TD>195</TD><TD>327</TD><TD>178</TD><TD>279</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>I was told it was a nice combo, but there were only 3 techs for the resulting Naga/Jell. <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Life</TD><TD>Pow.</TD><TD>Int.</TD><TD>Skill</TD><TD>Speed</TD><TD>Def. </TD></TR><TR><TD>104</TD><TD>150</TD><TD>152</TD><TD>143</TD><TD>123</TD><TD>104</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>Overall, unremarkable results, so I didn&#39;t save this result, and kept raising the two monsters. <BR>At 4y 6mo, I tried the combo again. The jell had the same 7 techs, the plant had added one, Seed Gun. <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>type</TD><TD>Life</TD><TD>Pow.</TD><TD>Int.</TD><TD>Skill</TD><TD>Speed</TD><TD>Def. </TD></TR><TR><TD>Jell</TD><TD>180</TD><TD>400</TD><TD>242</TD><TD>428</TD><TD>239</TD><TD>225 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Plant</TD><TD>230</TD><TD>335</TD><TD>209</TD><TD>402</TD><TD>232</TD><TD>284</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>Once again I was told it was a nice combo. The result was a Jell/Plant. Results: <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Life</TD><TD>Pow.</TD><TD>Int.</TD><TD>Skill</TD><TD>Speed</TD><TD>Def. </TD></TR><TR><TD>174</TD><TD>142</TD><TD>143</TD><TD>204</TD><TD>123</TD><TD>190</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR><B>And all 7 Jell Techs carried over!</B> <BR> <BR>I will continue, I need to raise a second plant to combine with the first, to see if I can get plant techs to carry over. Right now, it looks like if an offspring is the same main type as a parent it can get all the techs!This is important because I suspect that training in MR1 takes lifespan from your monster, like errantry does in MR2. In terms of trying to max out a monster, the less time spent at the training grounds, the better! <BR> <BR>Clearly, I&#39;m not doing very well in stat carryover, but I&#39;ll look into that too.

 Great report, Lisa!  I haven&#39;t done any combining, yet, but when I do, all of my monsters have at least 8 techs, so it shoulnd&#39;t be too difficult.  As for &#34;Training,&#34; I&#39;m not so certain that it does reduce lifespan, though I have only done limited research on that, and lack the GS or any other form of device to certify, so I can&#39;t be sure.  Interesting discovery, though...I can hardly wait for your findings on all of this, Lisa. ^_^

 Just a quick update. I started raising plant #2, and tried a few combinations that I did not save. <BR> <BR>I combined my retired plant with 9 techs with the other one at 1 year, told it was a bad combo, &#40;these are both Plant/Naga off Tail of The Sun PSX&#41; and I got a fairly unremarkable naga &#40;the #2 option in the list&#41;with 3 techs. I tried resetting 4 times and got the exact same result. I don&#39;t think combining is as random in MR1 as in MR2. <BR> <BR>I raised the second plant for a few years and at 3y 1m tried combining again. The second monster had 6 techs. Once again I was told the combo was bad, but this time I got a plant. It had stats about 200 composite total higher than a monster from CD and 6 techs. The interesting thing was, the six techs were not identical to the younger monster &#40;plant #2&#41;, there were 3 techs from way down the chart that only the first monster with 9 techs had aquired. &#40;including the super-deadly face drill&#41; It was as if I had gotten the best six possible! &#40;I think the three basic techs are required in carry over.&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still raising monster #2, and will give a final combo result with numbers in a day or two.

Ok, it&#39;s not as simple as I had hoped. My first Plant &#40;plant/naga&#41; was frozen at the first retirement warning.

 Makes me wonder if MR2 has the same sort of thing/. I mean, a combining month, so to speak. At least that one&#39;d be easy to test. Freeze two critters, combine &#39;em one month, try the next, try the next, etc. etc. ad infantum. <BR> <BR>Actually, in MR1, I managed to get very good at passing moves on, but I never mastered the stat-passing. A Ballon with 260 skill was my greatest achievement in that area. However, I found that if you took them out as soon as you got the first &#39;retire him&#39; warning, the moves seemed to cross over a lot easier &#40;at least for me&#41;.

In an effort to debunk the April as best month for combining, I did one final experiment. I took 2 pure dinos from CD and raised them cocurrently and froze them. I tried combining them several times during their lives, and got the best stats when combined during their prime, before any retirement warning. &#40;I&#39;ve misplaced the paper I wrote it down on, but the offspring of these guys at prime had two stats over 240 and one at 200.&#41;The final stats at retirement, and the offspring&#39;s: <BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>monster</TD><TD>Life</TD><TD>Pow.</TD><TD>Int.</TD><TD>Skill</TD><TD>Speed</TD><TD>Def. </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dino #1</TD><TD>220</TD><TD>334</TD><TD>235</TD><TD>430</TD><TD>216</TD><TD>155 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Dino #2</TD><TD>176</TD><TD>308</TD><TD>205</TD><TD>350</TD><TD>325</TD><TD>202 </TD></TR><TR><TD>offspring</TD><TD>100</TD><TD>120</TD><TD>100</TD><TD>140</TD><TD>100</TD><TD>100</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER> <BR>I was told it was a bad combo.

I just kept trying the combo over and over in week 4 of June. I got a different tech carryover result almost every time! Looks like the different weeks have nothing to do with tech carryover at all! &#40;and I wasted a lot of time!&#41; <BR> <BR>So, in conclusion, I would just add two points to my previous list of rules: <BR> <BR><B>1&#41;Combine monsters in their prime for best stat carryover. &#40;I saw a 400 total point drop as they got older, even though the parents had higher stats in old age!&#41; <BR>2&#41;The date doesn&#39;t play any role at all. You just have to keep trying your combo, and reversing the order combined helps &#40;or at least helps break up the boredom!&#41;</B>

 i remember that that was a common thought on mr1 boards - that you should not wait until retirement to combine.  it&#39;s intriguing to be reminded of it, and to see the proof of it, in one post.  good work lisa!

 Well, that would explain MY luck in combining.  I never let a mosner retire until I&#39;m forced to.  I&#39;m getting ready to make my first second generation monster in MR1, just for the sake of having it.  I intend to combine Danielle &#40;Pixie/Pixie, 7yrs, 3mo, got me Masters rank&#41; with Wags &#40;Market Tiger/Tiger, 5yrs, 6mo, my first monster&#41; to get my first MR1 Mint.  I don&#39;t know how this will result, but I know if Min tis as good in MR1 as she was in MR2 for me, then with the souped-up techs a Pixie has to choose form in MR1, Vix Fierce &#40;my intended name for her&#41;, shouldblow away all competition with ease! <BR> <BR>Well, enough bragging for me, it&#39;s time to see if I can make it come true...MUAHAHAHA  Wish me luck ^_^

 I don&#39;t remember whether it&#39;s been recorded on this board or not, but in my experience, each week in MR1 has its own formula for combinations that it follows at least 95% of the time.  For instance, on March 3rd, if you combine &#40;Main-type A&#41;/&#40;Sub-type B&#41; with &#40;Main-type C&#41;/&#40;Sub-type D&#41;, you will almost always get &#40;Main-type C&#41;/&#40;Sub-type A&#41;.  Or, as a more concrete example, if you combine a Worm/Naga with a Tiger/Jell &#40;in that order&#41;, you are almost guaranteed to get a Tiger/Worm.  If you switch the order around, you&#39;ll get a Worm/Tiger.  This made it SO much easier to fill out my Monster Book in MR1 than it was to fill out my cards in MR2. <BR> <BR>Oh yeah, and as far as getting a full tech carry-over if a parent&#39;s main-type matches the offspring&#39;s main-type, that must only work with a low number of techs.  I tried repeatedly to get one Dragon/Henger to pass on its complete move list to its identical offspring, but I could only get around 7-9 moves to transfer on any of the many tries I made.

 Strange that you mention this, Nate.  I just did that, though I regret to say that I&#39;m not keeping it.  I just combined my Mint with a Naga &#40;play combining&#41; to see what the Allure in MR1&#39;s card was.  Doing these little things keeps me sane while I catalog all night.  Anyways, as I had predicted, the result was an Allure &#40;I had also used this formula to get a Prism, Radar, and Vixen&#41;.  The allure had all stats in the high 140-190&#39;s, excpet life, which was at 100.  I didn&#39;t think much of it, until I looked at the techs it carried over.  It had the identical of what Vix Fierce had acquired.  The Allure had all of the techniques of a Pixie, with the exception of &#34;Kiss&#34; and &#34;Fire Ball.&#34;  Sadly, I&#39;m not keeping it, because I was just playing around and am not yet finished with my Mint.  Still, I thought it was impressive. <BR> <BR>BTW, if you care to try the same thing, I am catalogging and play combining in the November 3, of the year 1038.
