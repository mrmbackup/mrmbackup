 I have a theory. Not a hoax or prank, just a thought that crossed my mind. Could it be possible that Disk was meant to be in MR1 but they took out the method to get him, and by glitch you can get him from CDs? Please let me know. This was killing me for a while

 I personaly think that someone accidently screwed up on the method to get a regular one when they were translating MR1 for the USA.  I lucked out and managed to have the CD which produced one of the rares and all I had to do then was combine the two rares and get a regular one.  Both were listed in my book fully translated so I doubt they tried to scrap them.  I also doubt there was a glitch with the CDs used to get the rares.  There were only two of them listed &#40;maybe more&#41;.  I had the Inxs kick album and I forget the other one.  <BR> <BR>On a side note, they really were not much in looks.  Just image a monster fragment as a full circle and there you have it.  A disk!!  But they were good as fighters with high accuracy and speed.

 My theory is that Disk was supposed to be available as a super secret monster you can get from special CDs at the start, or perhaps even a CD that it can&#39;t read. However, the programmers made a typo: instead of making Disk the only pure rare available, they made DOODLE the only pure rare available. There&#39;s no reason Doodle should be able to be gotten from CDs, so I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a glitch. Also note how close Doodle and Disk are in the game; it&#39;s an easy typo to make.
