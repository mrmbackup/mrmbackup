<B>Why does my game seem so different from what you talk about here?</B> <BR>If you live in Europe, Australia, NZ or anyplace on the PAL television standard, then the game you call &#34;Monster Rancher&#34; is actually Monster Rancher 2. The tips in our MR2 section should help you. Here&#39;s how to tell the 2 apart: <BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD></TD><TD>Monster Rancher</TD><TD>Monster Rancher 2 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Assistant</TD><TD>Holly</TD><TD>Colt </TD></TR><TR><TD>Association</TD><TD>FIMBA</TD><TD>IMA </TD></TR><TR><TD>Expeditions</TD><TD>Karn</TD><TD>Roveest&#44;Kavaro&#44;Dr.Talico </TD></TR><TR><TD>Increasing Stats</TD><TD>Work <FONT SIZE="-2">earns money!</FONT></TD><TD>Drills </TD></TR><TR><TD>Foods</TD><TD>Potato&#44;Fish&#44;Meat</TD><TD>Potato&#44;Fish&#44;Meat&#44;Milk&#44;Cup Jelly </TD></TR><TR><TD>Item Shop</TD><TD>Man</TD><TD>Aunt Verde </TD></TR><TR><TD>Items</TD><TD>Taffy</TD><TD>Nuts Oil </TD></TR><TR><TD>Market</TD><TD>Dino&#44;Suezo&#44;Tiger</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Mocchi&#44;Gaboo&#44;Suezo&#44;Arrowhead&#44;Hare&#44;Zuum</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>View</TD><TD>Your Book</TD><TD>Your Cards </TD></TR><TR><TD>Techs</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Gotten At Training</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Gotten At Errantry</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Logo on Cover</TD><TD>&#34;Monster Rancher&#34; all text</TD><TD>&#34;Rancher&#34; has a suezo in the &#34;e&#34; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Exclusive Monsters</TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Dino&#44; Disc&#44; Doodle&#44; Magic</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Arrowhead&#44; Bajarl&#44; Baku&#44; Beaclon&#44; Ducken&#44; Gaboo&#44; Joker&#44; Metalner&#44; Mock&#44; Mocchi&#44; Niton&#44; Phoenix&#44; Undine&#44; Wracky&#44; Zilla&#44; Zuum</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER> <BR> <BR><B>What Does FIMBA stand for?</B> <BR>Fraternal International Monster Breeders Association <BR> <BR><B>I&#39;m A Master Rancher But Still Can&#39;t Get Comittee Permission!</B> <BR>Some monsters are not avaiable to you until you&#39;ve unlocked the species. Check the FAQ section thread &#34;How To Get All 20 Types&#34; for instructions on how to unlock them. Then, check the CD list to find CDs of the breed you&#39;re looking for. <BR> <BR><B>Can I make any of the /??? breed monsters I see in the CD list by combining?</B> <BR>No, they are only available off CDs. Combining 2 /??? monster will always give a regular monster of some sort. <BR> <BR><B>Can I have an assistant other than Holly?</B> <BR>No. <BR> <BR><B>How do I pick the best type of monster to raise?</B>  <BR>There is no &#39;best&#39; breed of monster, just like there are no bad breeds. If your monsters don&#39;t live long, or can&#39;t get very far in the official tournaments, change your raising method. There are no bad monsters, only bad methods!  <BR> <BR><B>Does raising the Life stat increase my lifespan?</B> <BR>No. It&#39;s been tested extensively. <BR> <BR><B>What do the attributes do for my monster?</B> <BR><I>Power:</I> how hard your monster hits when it uses Pow based &#40;yellow icon&#41; attacks. <BR><I>Intelligence:</I> how hard your monster hits with Int based &#40;green icon&#41; attacks, and helps them find items on expeditions. <BR><I>Life:</I> your lifebar in battles. &#40;Has NOTHING to do with your monsters&#39; lifespan.&#41;  <BR><I>Skill:</I> affects how accurately they attack  <BR><I>Speed:</I> affects how well they dodge attacks  <BR><I>Defense:</I> affects your monsters&#39; ability to withstand hits, high Def means less Life lost per hit.  <BR> <BR><B>What should I do when Holly warns about stress?</B> <BR>If Holly has warned you about stress, you have already lost lifespan due to excess stress. Try reading the FAQ threads about Items &amp; Foods and their effects. Essentially, you need to insure that your monster is fed Meat or Fish, gets rest on &#34;Seems Well&#34;, and is fed sufficient Mint &#40;at least twice a month&#41; to counteract the stress from Drills and Errantry. Feeding Taffy to reduce Fatigue helps as well. <BR> <BR><B>Why can&#39;t I find a particular item or opponent?</B>  <BR>Unlike story-based games, Monster Rancher 1 is primarily a Monster Breeding simulator, meaning that what you do in a variety of instances makes your individual game very different from other players&#39;. Some events are random, so not everyone finds things in the same place, not everyone has events happen in the same sequence. Relax, and play your own game. There is no race to see who can finish first, this is a game you can literally play for years without exhausting its potential.  <BR> <BR><B>These &#34;Methods&#34; take a lot of money. How do you get all that money to raise a good monster?</B>  <BR>Well, you need to use a &#34;moneymaker&#34; monster or two, or three. Simply take any monster, the Market monsters are good, and raise him until he can beat E class comfortably, and keep him there battling every un-official tourney. Once you have him going, freeze and raise another, this time up to D, and alternate the two battling. Then raise a third up to C. If you have 3 monsters, one each at E,D, and C level, you can make quite a bit of money in just a few game years. <BR> <BR><B>How can I make my monster live longer?</B> <BR>You need to become familiar with the items chart in the FAQ. Three items actually increase lifespan: Peaches, Plant Eggs, and Meat. You can also preserve the lifespan a monster is given at birth by managing Stress &amp; Fatigue. The best plan is to feed at least one Mint &amp; one Taffy every week. It&#39;s even better to feed 2 Mint &amp; 2 Taffy every week. Each monster can only find one Peach or Plant Egg ever. However, you can stockpile what several monsters find, and feed them all to other monsters. A monster can be fed unlimited numbers of Peaches and Plant Eggs. <BR> <BR><B>Where can I buy Monster Rancher?</B> <BR>The game has been out of print for a while, but copies do show up at <A HREF="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&amp;ht=1&amp;SortProperty=MetaEndSort&amp;query=monster%2Brancher" TARGET="_blank">Ebay</A> quite often.
