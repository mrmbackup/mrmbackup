 I have come up with a method to get monster that get good gains in int., spd, and skill. ie, ghost pixie, ect. <BR> <BR>here&#39;s the key:  <BR>t=taffy <BR>c=cart drill <BR>h=hunt drill <BR>f=field drill <BR>ft=forest drill <BR>g=guard drill <BR>l=logging drill <BR>cs=circus drill <BR>b=build drill <BR>m=mine drill <BR>ml=mailman drill <BR> <BR>Heres the method: <BR>You must have a vitimin D &#40;warning, it takes away lifespan significantly&#41; <BR>Regenerate a monster and take it to the ranch on week 1 of any month. give it vitimin D. <BR> <BR>Month 1: week 1- f <BR>         week 2- f <BR>         week 3- ml &amp; 2 t <BR>         week 4- take monster to town and freeze <BR>                 then get a dummy monster and rest it.  <BR> <BR>Month 2: week 1- feed dummy monster fish, go to town and freeze it. revive the monster you are raising.   <BR>         week 1- ft <BR>         week 2- ft <BR>         week 3- m &amp; 2 t <BR>         wekk 4- do the same as above as in month 1 week 4 <BR> <BR>Month 3: week 1- do the same as in month 2 <BR>         week 1- l <BR>         week 2- l <BR>         week 3- cs &amp; 2 t <BR>         week 4- same as above <BR> <BR>Month 4: week 1- do the same <BR>         week 1- g <BR>         week 2- g <BR>         week 3- b &amp; 2 t <BR> <BR>Repeat this process for as long as you feel it is necessary. When you go off the process, make sure you do the month right, do the week 4 and week 1 and on that week 1 go to training, and you will get the effects of vit. D until you come back. <BR> <BR>GOOD LUCK! <BR> <BR> <BR>PS- I will post a monster which will be a Ghost after i am done with my current ghost which i used this method but very unorganized and after 1 year of training to get it down right.

 forgot to say that on month 4 week 4 to do the same week 4 as above. <BR> <BR>also, if you get tired at all any other time to just use a taffy <BR> <BR>also, thanks to nate, and lisa for their methods which i sorta combined to make this one.

 ok, hengersrock just pointed this out- if you feed meat you get &#43;1 week of life. <BR> <BR>so if you change week 1 to week 2, wekk 2 to week 3, week 3 to week 4, and week 4 to week 1, and feed meat, the method will still work and be better

 What kind of monster would you suggest doing this with? Cause it hits a little flaw in, your monster wont gain any new attacks... some monsters just suck at going up in some stats. Your stats will end up being considerably low unless your some how able to become GOD and make a monster live till 23. Even with VIT D your stats arn&#39;t going to go up a beliefable amount. I have better things to do then try this method right now, but i&#39;m betting you can&#39;t hlaf your skill over 4 maybe 5 hundred tops. Not to mention the little flaw in that you wont be able to raise there ranking, and some monsters just don&#39;t like Taffy. I&#39;m really glad to see you slapped a bunch of random words together to make people think you know something special... but i&#39;m afraid your little &#34;method&#34; isn&#39;t going to work out as well as it seems... unless of course you just like losing and running out of money.
