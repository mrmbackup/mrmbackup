This is mainly for Link, but it might be helpful for everyone. <BR> <BR>When you use Vitamin D &#40;vitamin C also works, but D is more effective&#41;, your monster will have improved results from working or training, but it only lasts for 4 weeks. There is a way to get around that though. The effect doesn&#39;t really end after 4 weeks, but it ends after the fourth week IN A ROW that your monster is on the ranch. That means that if you work the monster 3 times, then freeze it and use another monster for a week, you can unfreeze the first monster and use it another 3 weeks, with the vitamin D still active. In fact, if you keep doing 3-freeze-3-freeze, you can get the vit. D effect for as long as your monster lives! However, the shortening of life span happens each week the vitamin is in effect, so this will radically reduce lifespan. <BR> <BR>This is a dirty little cheat the programmers didn&#39;t catch, or didn&#39;t want to fix. If you want to try it, feel free, but it quickly becomes tedious. It&#39;s just more fun to actually raise the monster the normal way. Also note that you can&#39;t sned your monster to Training, as this will last 4 weeks and end the effect. <BR> <BR>-- B Campbell, August 01, 1999

This is a post that I had printed out from the old board. Thought as a side note, I&#39;d add that the spelling and grammar errors were on my copy. I wanted to correct them, but I wanted to maintain the integrity of it by leaving it in it&#39;s original form. Also, in MR1, when you take your monsters to the freezer, there is an effect on them. Each trip adds Stress and after so many times, your training style begins to get more Strict. Just keep that in mind if you try this. My bro-in-law tried it, and he got results, but he also got bored with it. God forbid if he tries DP&#39;s MR2 method!! He&#39;ll go nuts!!

 Just a note, I tested this out recently, and Vitamin D became available at the shop in my game in the year 1041. This is probably not a set date, I just wanted people to be aware that it&#39;s one of the last items to show up at the shop.

Yes, it&#39;s real. Vitamin D will dramatically boost your monster&#39;s stats, and the &#34;trick&#34; makes it affordable. The downside is that it shortens lifespan greatly. I raised a couple of monsters on it from birth &#40;as part of an experiment to see if the effects were passed on to offspring&#41; and they just lived a few years.
