I have verified the lifespan loss for Vitamin C and Vitamin D is determined every time that the effect of it is granted, not when the drug is given to one&#39;s monster. <BR>I had been raising a dragon along a modified &#34;Shock Treatment&#34; style.  I had fed him a Vitamin D, worked him only on week 4, fed meat every time, along with abundant mint/taffy use. <BR>My monster still aged, and I received retirement warnings and he eventually died of old age. <BR>I had saved on the 1st week of January, if I rested him &#40;with taffy and mint leaf&#41; he would die on the 4th week of January &#40;3 weeks of life left&#41;. <BR>If worked in a light drill, he dies on the 2nd week of January &#40;1 week of work &#43; 2 weeks of Vit D life loss&#41;. <BR>I then fed him Vit C and rested him, he lived until the 4th week. <BR>Given Vit C and worked, he would die if rested the following week &#40;1 week work &#43; 1 week Vit C &#43; 1 week rest&#41;. <BR>As a control, I fed him one of the other drugs available at the shop and rested him, he died on the 2nd week &#40;1 or 2 months life loss at the time of the drug being given and stats are adjusted&#41;. <BR> <BR>But on a side note I did find out that if you send a monster on expedition it WILL live past it&#39;s normal expiration date and you can freeze and save your monster after he returns &#40;I had to find something to do with my dragon, being affected by VitD and having 3 weeks to live, he couldn&#39;t work or fight any more, so I sent him on expedition to clear out some obstacles&#41; <BR> <BR>This is given just as a word of caution.  If you&#39;re going to try the Shock Treatment to get a monster to live forever, don&#39;t be impatient, as I have found out that it can cost the monster it&#39;s life. <BR>&#40;1 week work &#43; 2 weeks Vit D - 1 week meat = 2 weeks aged for every week alive in this manner&#41; <BR> <BR>Happy Ranching <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#34;</FONT>

Thank you! I just finished off my Golem and am taking a few days off from research. This is very good to know for certain, I had suspected it earlier with short-lived  monsters I had on VitD their whole lives, but had not proven it exactly.

 just took a look at your golem, lisa!  quite impressive...a 17 yr 11 mo old golem with all 999s and all techs. <BR> <BR>anyone who wants to see it should go to the raising methods part of the mr1 archive, and choose the &#34;shock treatment&#34; thread.

 Thanks, Torey. He was off CD, and if I hadn&#39;t started using training for building up Speed, it might have taked forever, since he was only getting 2s on that light work.
