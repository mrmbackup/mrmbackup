 Okay... basically I need help defeating MauMau am I spelling that right? I haven&#39;t played in a few days because of the difficulty... <BR> <BR>He is the ONLY thing in this game I&#39;ve had trouble with so far... <BR> <BR>I have no clue what to do. Is there a trick to beating him? <BR> <BR>Or do I need to make 3rd gen monsters just to beat him? <BR>Because I&#39;ve KO&#39;ed every single monster up to him without even breaking a sweat. I rarely ever get hurt. <BR>Then all of a sudden, I fight him, and BANG! every hit he gains guts, and eventually he does his super move, which hits my entire team, and basically kills them or leaves them for dead. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve used my first gen monsters up until now, and they have just now &#34;reached potential.&#34; So is it trying to give me the hint that I need to breed? <BR>Or is there some trick to beating him that I am missing?

 best acvice I have is find a nice low guts move on one of your monsters that does decent damage against him and throw just that move. imho this is the toughest boss in the game.

 I would have had the same problem but I gave all my first gen characters the Final Guts ability. MaoMao attacked me and would have knocked me out but then all my guys traits kicked in, they rose from the dead and delivered the death blow. Final Guts is a great trait to have, especially much later in the game.

 well, I tried low guts moves but the thing ran me over and when it does that, two of my monsters always die and it leaves only 1. <BR> <BR>But thanks you two, I&#39;ll try a couple more things. I think I will get Final Guts for all my creatures, also.

 just to clarify my strategy a bit also try having at least 2 monsters with fighting aura and start throwing from the very start. usually it will be enough to put him away as you can start with in excess of 70 guts &#40;with 2 fighting auras&#41;  <BR> <BR> <BR>even worse is once you finish the story it opens a new adventue the nameless corridor. in it after about 7 levels you run into a random boss from the story but with about 2000 extra health and stats to match. mau mau is ridiculous as he is even worse with more health <BR>moo is also insane at this point as he hits for over 4000 with all of his attacks

 this stratagy normaly works max out a guy in speed then max out a guy in power and use other monsters for union attacks and guts regeneration then send the monster with max speed up to the boss so he cant hit your other guys the blitz him with your max power guy
