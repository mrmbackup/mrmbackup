 Hey guys, I&#39;m new here &#40;kind of&#41;. I used to post here at the MRA2 section as Ranma 1/2 quite some time ago. Anyway I fiddled around with breeding and figure some stuff out. <BR> <BR>Regarding DNA meter: <BR>This is completely random. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re breeding Raiden/? and Pixie/?. The possible offsprings that you get will have random DNA meters &#40;in this case, you&#39;ll get 3 possible offsprings - Raiden/?, Pixie/?, Raiden/Pixie&#41;. Notice that if you cancel the combining and then try it again, you&#39;ll get different DNA meters results. <BR> <BR>Regarding inherited traits &#40;show, injury, bonding, etc.&#41;: <BR>Some of these are random, some of these are set.  <BR>Random: Bonding, Policy, Show, Training. <BR>Set: Injury, Sickness, Motivation. <BR>I&#39;ve experimented with my first generations with this. I found out that no matter what I do, for Injury I always get Steel Body &#40;none of the parents were injured more than once before breeding&#41;. For Sickness, I always got Healthy. For Motivation, I always got unmotivated &#40;I&#39;ll do some  more research on this when I max out my second generations&#41;. For Bonding, sometimes I get loner, sociable, or sceptical. For Show, either YoungBlood or none. For Policy, it&#39;s random &#40;either like/dislike&#41;. And finally for training, it&#39;s also random, as mentioned. <BR> <BR>&#40;Boy was experimenting tiring, I must&#39;ve saved and loaded at least 100 times -_-&#39;&#41; <BR> <BR>There are still some stuff I&#39;ve yet to figure out such as the AP inheritance. So far whenever I breed my first generation with a newly created monster, the second gen inherits the first gen&#39;s AP. When I breed my first gen and another first gen, I get around 2/3 of the combined AP of the parents &#40;first monster had 1177, second monster had 1453, second gen got around 2300&#41;. I&#39;m still unsure about the Personality. I&#39;ll try playing around with combining again in the future and post some more.

 Whoops, I forgot to add something back there. About the parents&#39; &#34;used&#34; DNA meters. When the DNA meters hit Zero they don&#39;t disappear AND they can still be used for breeding &#40;although I&#39;m not sure about what traits/properties the offsprings will get&#41;. Looks like we&#39;ll have to donate them to get rid of them &#62;_&#60;

 Another thing I forgot... <BR> <BR>Regarding Stats: <BR>The offsprings inherit whatever stats the parents had. Here are a few examples: <BR> <BR>First generation X new monster &#40;not raised&#41;: <BR>First generation - Pow&#40;4&#41;, Int&#40;6&#41;, Spd&#40;3&#41;, Acc&#40;4&#41;, Def&#40;5&#41;, Life&#40;7&#41;. <BR>New monster - Pow&#40;2&#41;, Int&#40;1&#41;, Spd&#40;1&#41;, Acc&#40;2&#41;, Def&#40;2&#41;, Life&#40;2&#41;. <BR>Offspring - Pow&#40;3-4&#41;, Int&#40;5-6&#41;, Spd&#40;2-3&#41;, Acc&#40;3-4&#41;, Def&#40;4-5&#41;, Life&#40;6-7&#41;. It varies by the monsters&#39; types. <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;Notice that the offspring inherits strictly the first gen&#39;s stats. <BR> <BR>First generation X first generation: <BR>First generation - Pow&#40;4&#41;, Int&#40;6&#41;, Spd&#40;3&#41;, Acc&#40;4&#41;, Def&#40;5&#41;, Life&#40;7&#41;. <BR>First generation - Pow&#40;7&#41;, Int&#40;8&#41;, Spd&#40;2&#41;, Acc&#40;3&#41;, Def&#40;3&#41;, Life&#40;5&#41;. <BR>Offspring - Pow&#40;6-7&#41;, Int&#40;7-8&#41;, Spd&#40;2-3&#41;, Acc&#40;3-4&#41;, Def&#40;4-5&#41;, Life&#40;6-7&#41;. It varies by the monsters&#39; types. <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42;Notice that the offspring gets the highest stats from either parents. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if the breeding system is similar with other PS2 games, because this is my first PS2 MR game.

 Hey guys, found some more stuff out: <BR> <BR>When BOTH parents&#39; DNA meters reach zero and you combine them, it&#39;ll be like combining newly created monsters. Nothing will be passed down to the offsprings. No AP, traits, etc. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got another one for &#34;Show&#34;: Veteran <BR>I got this from combining a monster with zero DNA meter &#40;raised to max&#41; and another monster with more than one DNA meter &#40;also raised to max&#41;.

 The games explaintion of dna breeding a bit. <BR> <BR>Motivation = average motivation of a monster when you reset it by doing a show.  So if it always is at 100 % when you do a show it&#39;s going to pass on a good motivation <BR>I.E. 100% the first show, 50% the second show. it will have a 75% motivation. <BR>The plus is the motivation will increase faster <BR> <BR>Bonding = average bonding the monster had with its trainers. <BR>same I.E as above. <BR>the plus is bonding will increase faster <BR> <BR>Show = depending on how many shows the monster was in. &#40;no numbers yet&#41; <BR>The plus is they will get less tired after a show <BR> <BR>Injury and Sickness : <BR>depending on how many times the parents have been Injuried or sick will increase the baby&#39;s likelyhood to get injuryied or sick. <BR>I.E. bad parents = bad child, If the parents got sick alot the kid is going to get sick eaasier. <BR>The plus is if the stats are good they don&#39;t get sick as often. <BR> <BR>Policy : <BR>Depending on the training policy you used with the parnets. <BR>I.E. if you used hard alot it will like hard. <BR>The plus side is it will get less tired using that policy then it normally would. <BR> <BR>Now I wonder if it will take after one parent more than the other if say you use that parnets dna more

 About the Motivation though, I&#39;ve experimented with it for some time now. I raised 4 monsters that ALWAYS have 100% motivation on every show and I still get unmotivated offspring. So that&#39;s why I stated that it&#39;s random. On the other hand, I did get about 3 &#34;Raring to go&#34; on motivation out of about 50 tries. Around 15-20 blank, and the rest were unmotivated. @_@

 seeing how good that stat is it might take more then one generation to get it all the time.  Also where they at full motivation when you sealed them?&#40;that is also a factor&#41;  But it still may boil down to monster speices playing a big factor.  I&#39;m currently rising a 3rd gen pixie I&#39;ll seal it at 100% and try it out a bunch of times when its done. <BR>I really hate to think I could have made a much better pixie thing if I just kept redoing it till I got raring to go. Also I&#39;m only really focusing on 1 monster at a time :&#41; the rest are just gene pool fun.

 Yep, all of them were at full motivation and still got unmotivated most of the time for some reason...

 Hmmm well I&#39;m stumpped almost.  It usaually takes 2 months to get a monster from one show to the next with 100% motivation.  Maybe it needs to be in a set number of shows before that stat counts.  Even if it lives to 3 it will be in about 17-18 shows and I doubt Motivation needs to be all the way up to 100% on average to get raring to go.  So maybe have them in 20 or 25 shows.  Thats about all I can come up with that may fit though but it sounds like a shot in the dark even to me.

 My monsters are finally ready for combining, as Nayuta told me they&#39;d reached their potential so I should combine them and they&#39;re no longer gaining stats at shows. I went to combine them and Nayuta and the one training the monster complained at me for trying! <BR> <BR>Am I something wrong or am I supposed to just ignore them?

 Do you mean that when you try to seal, the trainer complains? If that&#39;s the case then don&#39;t worry, when the bonding between the trainer and the monster is high, the trainer is going to complain when you&#39;re trying to seal their monster. So yeah, just seal them and combine them.

 On the motivation dna part.  My monsters are getting &#34;raring to go&#34; on the 3rd and 4th generation.  That stat might just take a while to build up to start passing on from generation to generation consistantly.

 Well on the Dna note anyone else noticing Dna traits may appear hidden in a monster that there rasing?  Like with early Generation and new monsters while they have been rasied for over 2 years bonding has already been at 100, I&#39;m seeing movativation starting to build faster like it had &#34;raring to go&#34; in the dna trait. <BR>So anyone else seem to notice any dna bonuses appear in a monster while your rasing it &#40;not physically appear but act like it had them&#41; or am I just seeing things.

 I know it may be wrong but I have been inbreeding my monsters and waiting to the very last age message before combining them. I have noticed that I got really good results. <BR> <BR>From Parent and Child Breading: <BR>Breed: Pixie / Piroro <BR>Generation: 3rd <BR>Age: 0 years 0 months <BR>Pow: 11 <BR>Int: 14 <BR>Spd: 7 <BR>Acc: 12 <BR>Def: 6 <BR>Lif: 12 <BR> <BR>For a new born these are awesome stats. I also noticed that bred monsters have a nice pool of Anima to get skills and such right off the bat. <BR> <BR>I have had other monsters with similar results but the one thing that seems to be a must is that you must get the monster past the final age message. you know the one where it says it can&#39;t progress in any matter any more.

 ther are 2 age messages  <BR> <BR>one says your monster has reached its max potential...basically you monster has gotten a max stat total for its generation and breed. the monster can no longer gain stats but can still gain anima from adventures. <BR> <BR>the second is reached maximum lifespan which is basically the your monster is dead message. it no longer gains stats or anima. <BR> <BR>I have found sealing monsters before the lifespan message will give you worse results in combining than if you played out the monster to its full &#34;lifespan&#34;

 combining lower generation monsters with higher generation monster will produce greater intial stats but will shorten the amount of time given for potential.  <BR> <BR>dont be suprised when you combine a 4th gen wit ha 1st gen if it doesnt max potential in under a year &#40;6 months is the fastest I have seen&#41;
