 This isn&#39;t a huge thing, but I thought people would like to know about a slightly annoying aspect to missions.  The time limit on the missions is how long you have to report.  If you fufill the mission on the last week you will still fail it because you don&#39;t have time to report. <BR> <BR>I learned this by putting the performance for the performance mission on the last week. <BR> <BR>-Berge

 I have something to add. If you fail a mission and you&#39;re signing up for another mission, they&#39;ll give you somewhat &#34;easier&#34; missions. And when you finish this one and complete it, they&#39;ll say that you&#39;ve made up for it :D

 Dunno what happens if you keep failing. I&#39;d assume you just keep getting given easy missions until you finally finish one, but I don&#39;t know.  <BR> <BR>Anyhow, since we&#39;re talking about missions, figured I&#39;d give a couple heads-ups to people getting started: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Give Show missions - these have you give a circus show within a time limit, but note that each show has a minimum satisfaction that you have to reach during that show to succeed at the mission. Scroll right with the directional pad when you&#39;re looking at the mission info to see what satisfaction you have to reach. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Capture missions - if it doesn&#39;t tell you offhand, scroll right to see how many of a monster you need to catchto succeed at the mission. Also, if the monster you&#39;re trying to catch is a basic &#34;pure&#34; monster name &#40;like Lesione, Plant, Garu&#41;, animals with either that main type or subtype will do the trick. So for example you can defeat a Poseidon or Undine, and they will count as a &#34;capture&#34; for a Lesione mission.

 Just something to add to Trickster&#39;s list: <BR> <BR>3&#41; Get Items missions - Well, you need to get the items that are being asked. You can do this in adventures &#40;if you don&#39;t already have them&#41;. My reccomendation is don&#39;t go on adventures just to look for the items, kind of a waste of time, and the reward money is minimal compared to capture and give show missions.

 can anyone tell me if there is a trick to capturing monsters, or if I just have to defeat them in battle??  I&#39;m afraid to take a capture mission, because I&#39;m not sure I know how to &#34;capture&#34; a monster...

 you just have to find an fight the monster on a battle &#40;of course you need to defeat it&#41;. <BR> <BR>I recomend looking for the missions that specify the monster type over the species.  If it asks for a specific monster than all the noron will be that specific monster.

 Has anyone gotten the special missions after beating the game? I have gotten one, but I cannot understand how to complete it. I have the mission where you must investigate the evil in the cave of tukuyomi. does anyone know how to get these missions started. I have takled to the client, but that does not seem to help.

 I tried the Tukuyomi one but never got deep enough, I think. <BR> <BR>I also tried the CongaConga one, and this is what happened: <BR>I went into the adventure, and as I was going along, slaying and grabbing loots, when I went into the spiral, I got a location triggered battle against a monster who killed me so very very dead. Just enough time to make some ineffectual attacks and lament the added fatigue from the KOs. <BR> <BR>I expect that all of them are this way: Somewhere in the adventure mode is a invisible trigger point for the special battle. You just have to find it and manage to kill the beast.

 darkalo is correct <BR>also remember these are S rank missions and are comparable to boss fights &#40;sometimes even worse&#41;

 I got the one from the King of Campana in which you go into the adventure zone and have to defeat three monsters.  Only problem is they had some serious power and kicked my monsters butts even though i had one that had a wonderful habit of one hit KOing everything in sight.  He was doing Zero damage and they kept doing no damage and he was at max for his generationg &#40;hes gen 2 by the way&#41;.
