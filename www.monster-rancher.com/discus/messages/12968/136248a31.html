 I was playing EVO, and I saw something that amazed me. I was just advancing my monster&#39;s stats to level 17 &#40;above 1700&#41; and I came across something intresting. It appeared to have another slot for a stat gain. What I&#39;m saying is that there was a ten-thousands slot. Can your monster&#39;s stats go over 10,000?

 I didn&#39;t know Monsters could go over 999 for each stat. I used my AR MAX to max one monster to see If I could beat JhuChu in the first battle but her Jokers caused around 2,000 points per hit. However Nayuta keeps telling me that my Monster is done growing with 999 in every stat so now I&#39;m really confused.

 How old is your monster? My monsters stats go over 999. Maybe you might need a certain item. I don&#39;t know, but my monster&#39;s stats go over 999. But my question still is not answered. No offense, Scorpio Maurus.

 I&#39;ve never had a monster with anything higher than level 41 yet... so I don&#39;t know if they can get stats higher than 9999.

 I don&#39;t know now, but the problem seems to be the AR MAX codes. They assumed that like all other MR&#39;s that 999 would be max so thats what their codes are set at. I assume the game still read them a Maxed though because of something AR MAX did to the codes. I think thats why I got the message about my monster being done growning.I converted codes from CodeBreaker to AR and at 9,999 the Level shown is Lv. 99 I don&#39;t think they can go any higher than Lv. 99.

 For &#34;final&#34; gen monsters &#40;with full grandparent/parent history--which is likely how the game counts &#34;generation&#34; for stat purposes&#41;, the &#34;almost complete&#34; message came for me at about 120 levels of total stats, or 12,000 pts. Divided by six stats, that&#39;s an average of 2000 for final generation monsters. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t remember what level totals produced the same message for a brand new first gen, but I suspect it was less than half that &#40;or less than 999&#41;... so anyone setting the stats of a monster with a cheat device to 999s without also giving it a history to raise its generation would probably get the &#34;cap&#34; message. As I recall, I capped a couple of my first generation of monsters, and as I also recall, none of them had more than 50 levels of combined stats. 1000 across the board would be 60 levels, more than enough to draw the cap message. <BR> <BR>It might not be possible to find out without using a cheat device whether any one stat can go higher than 9999, because of the same cap. In theory, you could raise two first generations in a single stat, then mix it twice, raise those monsters in the same stat, and then mix them to produce a &#34;final&#34; gen monster in the same stat, and possibly reach level 99 in a single stat, however, since the &#34;final&#34; gen cap seems to be around 120, 125 total levels, and since most gadgets train all stats somewhat, you&#39;d have to be getting 4:1 imbalance between your favored stat and all other stats combined. <BR> <BR>From what I&#39;ve seen of the gadgets, there is no gadget build that would allow this. So it is a practical impossibility. <BR> <BR>All it would take to confirm is for someone to alter a cheat device&#39;s code to set the stats to higher than 9999, and see what the game does. <BR> <BR>But in all honesty, I think 9999 is a practical impossibility, even without it being a hard-coded maximum. Of course, many past games have included loop-holes that allowed fully maxed monsters to be raised, and this is based purely on my unconfirmed experience, so.
