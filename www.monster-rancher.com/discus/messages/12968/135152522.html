 Hey guys, I have a few questions if anyone knows... <BR> <BR>1.  Is it possible to defeat Jhuchu in Grabad?  I figure it is, but for my first run through I didn&#39;t want to spend the time finding out.  Does anyone know what the &#39;prize&#39; is? <BR> <BR>2.  Besides the DNA &#40;motivational/injury/etc.&#41; does anything else transfer from parent to child?  Like Traits or Techniques? <BR> <BR>3.  Do certain monsters have better guts regeneration than others?  Or is guts regen based only on # of monsters and how many are lined up? <BR> <BR>4.  Badges... I thought I saw that they&#39;re used when combining?  Are they supposed to show up in inventory, and does anyone know what they do specifically? &#40;ex. Dark Badge = ???&#41; <BR> <BR>5.  Does intelligence have anything to do with finding items during adventures?  Swapping in higher int. monsters doesn&#39;t seem to make any difference in the # of items found.  Maybe higher int. = better items found? <BR> <BR>Thanks!  If nobody knows I&#39;ll probably end up doing testing myself to find out. <BR> <BR>&#40;SI&#41;

 &#62;1. Is it possible to defeat Jhuchu in Grabad?  <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t know, but it seems unlikely. The story pretty much requires you to lose at that point. <BR> <BR>&#62;2. Besides the DNA &#40;motivational/injury/etc.&#41; <BR>&#62;does anything else transfer from parent to <BR>&#62;child? Like Traits or Techniques?  <BR> <BR>Babies bred from saucers start their life with a few thousand AP. I didn&#39;t spend the time to figure out what, if anything, influenced the amount. This obviates the need to pass on traits or skills as you can just buy the starting traits or skills you want. <BR> <BR>&#62;3. Do certain monsters have better guts <BR>&#62;regeneration than others? Or is guts regen <BR>&#62;based only on # of monsters and how many are <BR>&#62;lined up?  <BR> <BR>If linking makes any difference in guts regen I didn&#39;t notice it. It DID appear to me that speed up caused a noticable increase in guts regen but I wouldn&#39;t state it as a categorical fact. LIkewise, I used a few different monster types and didn&#39;t notice any particular difference between teams. <BR> <BR>&#62;4. Badges... I thought I saw that they&#39;re used  <BR>&#62;when combining?  <BR> <BR>Yes. <BR> <BR>&#62;Are they supposed to show up in inventory, and  <BR>&#62;does anyone know what they do specifically?  <BR>&#62;&#40;ex. Dark Badge = ???&#41;  <BR> <BR>Now that you mention it, I don&#39;t believe I ever saw any in inventory unless I was about to combine something that was compatible with a particular badge. <BR> <BR>&#62;5. Does intelligence have anything to do with <BR>&#62; finding items during adventures?  <BR> <BR>Not that I ever noticed. My low-int monsters found pretty much the same stuff in the same amounts as the high-int ones. Finding better stuff seems to be more a function of equipping the monsters with &#34;BoxItemUp&#34; or &#34;AdvItemUp&#34; traits than anything else. <BR> <BR>Basically, your monster is this lego brick that you attach other lego bricks to depending on what it is you want to achieve. Breeding as you might have thought of it in the previous games doesn&#39;t really enter into things much.

 Wow!  Thanks for the quick and detailed reply Slick!  But I do know that linked monsters have increased guts regen.  Besides support abilities, there wouldn&#39;t be much reason to link up otherwise.

 3 yes having your monsters lined up helps, imho different monsters regen at different rates but not so much to make a real difference. only having 3 slow or 3 real fast regen rates does it seem like it at all. <BR> <BR>4 badges  <BR>data inventory consumables last page under that heading. <BR>will have a brief description telling you what triat the badge will bestow. <BR> <BR>5 no int doesnt seem to matter. you can find or make items to help with finding items, or increase the level of items you find and various other loot related stuff. different monsters seem to find slightly different things and the map your on has a specific list of what all you can loot

 Yep, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s probably why I thought that &#34;speed up&#34; was making guts regen faster. The times I used the ability were primarily when the whole team was linked for maximum effect.

 I think Beating Jhuchu is absolutly not Possible. I used my AR MAX to max out 3 monsters just to see and All stats were at 999 and her Jokers caused 2,400 points of damage to each of my monsters. Her monsters are Stronger if yours are stronger. Sadly no Prize I tried twice &amp; the first time she killed them one at a time, the second she used a Union attack and killed them all together. Oh yeah and Even with 999 Strength I still caused 0 points of damage on most of my hits, So I don&#39;t know what their defense went up to. But It seems to me to be highly unlikely to beat her then.

 I agree about Grabad.  I wasted time there, myself, though I&#39;m on my first run-through and thought maybe  there would be a branched story.  Nope, you can&#39;t win.  I don&#39;t think her Monster&#39;s DEF goes up to anything, though; I think the program just initializes any hit to 0 &#40;creates a Null function&#41;.  The attack looks to be a percentage ratio, though.

 WOW ok I converted some Codebreaker codes to AR MAX and they give 9,999 to each category so now I will start a new game on my other memory card to see if my Poor monsters still cause 0. I assume they will but who knows. I should&#39;ve known AR MAX was stupid again their Idea of maxed stats is 999, I wonder why they didn&#39;t actually check the games max stats before making their codes.

 Yup it&#39;s confirmed, I started a new game on another Memory card and Gave my Monster 9,999 on every stat the first week and I just made it to Jhuchu now and My Piroro Sora couldn&#39;t do anything to stop her. It said No Damage everytime, but at least it took her 4 hits to kill me this time instead of one LOL. Also in the first few tutorial battles you only cause a set ammount of damage until they are done explaining everything to you.
