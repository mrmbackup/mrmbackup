Under Construction <BR> <BR><B>How do I get monsters in this game?</B> You can use CDs, DVDs and game discs to create monsters, you can buy discs in-game, you can re-create monster types you have made before by using your book, you can get data added to your book by defeating opponents in battle, and, you can combine monsters you already have. <BR> <BR><B>What do the attributes do for my monster?</B> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Attribute</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">Effect</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B><FONT SIZE="-2">Power</FONT></B></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">how hard your monster hits when it attacks in battle with Power &#40;yellow icon&#41; attacks</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B><FONT SIZE="-2">Intelligence</FONT></B></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">helps the monster attack with Intelligence &#40;green icon&#41; attacks</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B><FONT SIZE="-2">Life</FONT></B></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">your lifebar in battles &#40;Has NOTHING to do with your monsters&#39; lifespan.&#41;</FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD><B><FONT SIZE="-2">Accuracy</FONT></B></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">affects how accurately they attack</FONT>  </TD></TR><TR><TD><B><FONT SIZE="-2">Speed</FONT></B></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">affects how well they dodge attacks</FONT>  </TD></TR><TR><TD><B><FONT SIZE="-2">Defense</FONT></B></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="-2">affects your monsters&#39; ability to with stand hits&#44; high Def means less Life lost per hit</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR><B>All of my Discs seem to make Hare &#40;Hare/Hare&#41; monsters, what&#39;s up with that?</B> <BR>Make sure that you are only using pre-recorded music CDs, PS2 games, PSX games, and DVDs in the shrine. The PS2 isn&#39;t capable of reading most PC CD-ROMs &#40;unless they have an audio track&#41; and other disc formats, so the game reverts to making this monster, rather than nothing. if ALL discs make Hares, then this means your PS2 is having problems reading discs. There are several possible causes: lens in need of cleaning, lens out of alignment &#40;need professional adjustment&#41; or a worn out laser assembly &#40;needs professional replacement&#41;. <BR> <BR><B>What&#39;s the deal with Union Attacks?</B> <BR>When you have three monsters linked in combat and more than 50 Guts, and if you have charged at least one Union Attack in the Anima menu, you can choose to execute a Union Attack by choosing the red attack available in the attack move menu. A Union Attack spends all of your available Guts and hits all enemies on the screen. Once you&#39;ve started your attack, a red/blue bar will appear. You need to hit the X button repeatedly to strengthen your attack. Many bosses also use Union Attacks, which will activate the red/blue bar. You hit X button in this instance to reduce the damage done by the boss. <BR> <BR>To charge your Union Attacks, hit the square button in an adventure or town screen, and choose the Anima menu. Once there, use the D-pad to select a monster and hit R1 to use that monster&#39;s Anima Points to charge the Union Attack bar. To charge to 1 Union Attack, it costs 100 AP. Each successive charge &#40;up to a maximum of 9&#41; costs double the previous step. <BR> <BR>Monsters who have aged beyond the point where they gain AP automatically charge the Union Attack bar with the AP they would have gained. <BR> <BR>Union Attacks tend to about as much damage as an E rated Life Damaging attack, but they hit all enemies regardless of whether they are linked or not. Union Attacks aren&#39;t very useful in boss battles, because they do fairly small amounts of damage and consume all of your Guts. Union Attacks are a great way to quickly clear enemy groups in adventures &#40;so long as your Union Attack is strong enough to one-hit KO all enemies&#41;, especially if you&#39;re using an old monster whose AP will automatically charge the Union Attack bar, or in high-level dungeons where you gain 600&#43; AP on each monster &#40;so you can easily recharge Union Attacks&#41;. <BR> <BR><B>Do monsters die in this game?</B> <BR>Monsters do not die in Monster Rancher: EVO. Monsters who reach old age &#40;Nayuta will tell you when they will no longer gain stats&#41; can still be used indefinitely in adventures and shows, but they will not gain stats after shows and any Anima Points they would have earned will automatically be dumped into the Union Attack bar. <BR> <BR>Monsters who are turned into saucers before they&#39;ve reached old age will not pass on their stats when combined as well as monsters who are turned into saucers and combined after you get the old age message. <BR> <BR>Generally speaking, there&#39;s no need to keep old monsters active, because if you combine them with a saucer of comparable power, the child will have very close to the same stats and can gain Anima Points from battle and stat increases after shows. <BR> <BR>Old monsters are also more susceptible to injury, so if you keep them around, take pains not to let them get too stressed or tired.
