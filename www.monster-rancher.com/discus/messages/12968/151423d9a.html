 ok so I am trying to get a list of all the enemy monsters in the game put together and here are my results for the Devil&#39;s Forest so far the first dungeon in the game.  Well actually before I post my results so far guess I should explain them alittle and a few things I have noticed.  The monsters are different from week to week as someone mentioned in another thread sorry I forget who, I am still working on a method for figuring that out.  Also the monsters stats grow it seems as the game progresses or at least their life does I do not yet know if it caps out yet or not as I am still trying to put this all together for the first area, but figure I&#39;d post my results so far so if anyone has any prefered way i post it from now as i figure it out i can do it their way or if i a forgetting something important &#40;it has been know to happen&#41;.  but anyway the results for the Devil&#39;s Forest I have divided up into 4 sections making the different areas in the game as well as my fame in the area since it was suggested that might factor in if it does have yet to notice it but still posting that data anyway.  the percents are the number of times that monster appeared in a fight out of the total number of times i fought in that area during that time ok so here comes the listing. <BR> <BR>In the first one there are 6 monsters and I am sure someone will ask it so i will answer ir now  <BR>Q: how do you get even percents in an area with 6 monsters? <BR> <BR>A: the first time through is really twice and since i did not know about the monsters changing i had started to combine my list so the first data set is out of 10 battles and the rest are out of 6. <BR> <BR>Flaminden Raiden/pixie life 98  30% chance <BR>PumpkiDuck Ducen/pancho lif 98 20% chance <BR>Uminaibi Lesione/ maya life 128 10% chance  <BR>Pixie pixie/pixie life 106 30% chance <BR>Golem golem/golem life 121 40% chance <BR>Kangabron beaklon/maya life 119 20% chance  <BR>MellonCho pancho / beaklon life 110 20% chance <BR> <BR>so that was the monsters i encountered in area 1 the first time through I have yet to encounter the Flaminden, Pixie, Golem, Kangabron, MellonCho, Uminaibi again though in any more adventures now on the second time through i found these ones. <BR> <BR>16 fame <BR>Momo Slime jell / pixie life 121 83% chance <BR>Hare hare/hare life 114 67% chance <BR>Jaguarbeat tiger/ beaklon life 123 67% chance <BR>MagaMocken ducken/maya life 121 33% chance <BR> <BR>I know 4 completely new monsters  <BR> <BR>on the third attempt through <BR> <BR>7 fame &#40;yes my fame dropped i don&#39;t know why&#41; <BR>Scarbio Lesione / Beaklon life 148 50% chance <BR>PumpkiMochi Mocchi / Pancho life 131 50% chance <BR>Insebel Jell / Beaklon life 131 50% chance <BR>Queen Plant Plant / Pixie life 148 50% chance <BR> <BR>yet another 4 monsters, but these ones appear in the further areas later. <BR>so on to my fourth adventure <BR> <BR>Fame 17 <BR>Mocchi mocchi/mocchi life 145 100% encounter <BR>Pink Golem golem/pixie lif 140 50% encounter <BR>Matalyn Gitan/maya life 140 33% encounter <BR>Scarabio lesione/beaklon life 156 33% encouter <BR> <BR>now here is the intesting thing and i noticed this before with monsters in another sector of the forest but Scarabio&#39;s life increased 8 points from venture 3 to venture 4, at first i though maybe their life points were connected to my fame status but my data on mocchi&#39;s in another sector showed it still went up, my thought on this is that as your monsters grow so do the monsters in the region perhaps, anyway i am not going to post my data for the other 3 monster zones in the forest till i have a bit more to go on, although it seems more consistant, but here is my research project as i have it so far.  I will continue to work on this as it is something that will not just work overnight.  If anyone has any questions or wants me to change my posting format just leave a comment and I will do my best to change or find the information you wanted.  So I guess for now I am out on this topic then, be back with more info as i come up with it
