 My team was the Piroro, a Zan, and a Beaclon. My strategy should work for you, with some alterations. <BR> <BR>I ran everyone in to close range because his close range attacks seemed to be more likely to target a single monster and to be a little less devastating. I ran everyone in together because the link boosted guts regen, and I found that leaving the Piroro and Zan out to draw fire only got them killed very quickly and left the Beaclon without the guts regen to effectively whittle away the tree&#39;s Life. <BR> <BR>The Beaclon has a close range move for 5 guts that has decent hit and damage. With your Golem, you&#39;ll probably either want to buy Double Chop if you can afford it, or just be sure he has the Accuracy to land most of the time. Obviously, if you&#39;ve bought Stone Guard, you should pop that first once everyone is close in and linked to increase your survivability. Then just pound away with the Golem. Don&#39;t bother with anyone else unless their attacks do decent damage for the Guts cost. You&#39;ll have more trouble with it because the Golem&#39;s moves cost more than the Beaclon&#39;s cheapo strike, but it should still work. Obviously, if you have Anima to burn, Attack traits like Warrior, Infighter, and Full Power will help to seal the deal. <BR> <BR>It also helps that once you pound him some, he starts spending moves to heal, and with a beater, you shouldn&#39;t have a problem keeping ahead of that. I also noticed that when you&#39;re in close, he wastes time charging for a push instead of attacking, much of the time, which is basically free time for you to regen Guts and pound him.

 I had an uberspeedy Saga &#40;Zan/Naga&#41;, and I just linked him to the boss and let my Haktak and Jelaydon do all the pounding, linked together and out of range. <BR>Basically Ogglemock couldn&#39;t attack anything but my Saga, who dodged pretty much everything the boss threw at him. I would quickly move my Saga back into link with Ogglemock if he was pushed away, and when he started his annoying regenerating thing, one accurate attack from Saga was able to stop it. <BR>If either your Piroro or Maya is incredibly speedy, you might want to try this. Or come up with your own strategy. Don&#39;t rush into things.

 try one powerhouse to attack and one wall for defense.  Keep the wall up close and let the aggressor fight from the rear.  If you lose once just run another circus and try again.

 You don&#39;t need to follow my exact monster choices, I was just giving examples &#40;if you did, our teams would be too similar! XD&#41;. Along general guidelines, have a speed or defense monster link to him and use attackers from the rear, like Mayhem said. Make sure to give the monster up in front good accuracy so it can finish off Ogglemock if needed. <BR>This strategy works for me most times. Sometimes I need to make a few changes, so be open-minded!

 I don&#39;t know, but try it out with the levels you have now, and if that doesn&#39;t work, put on a few more shows and then try again.
