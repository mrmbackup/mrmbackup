 This happened twice, I was doing a Showtime, and after doing the preformance with the Box Magic I got a silver star in the area, like a coin would appear normally. It didn&#39;t seem to give any money, and made a different sound when picking it up. It was a level 2 Box Magic, I didn&#39;t get a nessicarily good score, probably around 70, both different scores each time... The monster working it was a dragon/maya, 4 months old... <BR>I&#39;ve never seen the star before when playing except on that one prop with the dragon on it... <BR>Anyone know why I got it or what it does?

 I have a couple ideas. I think it may be the prop. I&#39;m not sure what it does, either. I think it either boosts fame or the monster&#39;s motivation slightly, but I haven&#39;t nailed down what it does or which prop might cause it. <BR> <BR>Out of curiosity, which prop &#40;if any&#41; do you have on that gadget?

Darklao, just in case you were wondering, I have gotten these stars with almost all of my gadgets. At least one in every show. It always seems to come up with <B>Box Magic</B>, <B>Barrel Toss</B>, <B>Knife Throw</B>, and occasionally, <B>Cannon</B> something, I forgot what it was called. I also had the very same question, but never got around to ask it.

 Hm. Well on the Box Magic I have Shake Parts and an INT tank M. This is the first time I&#39;ve seen it with any of my gadgets.

 Oh but that might be something to note... Shake Parts says its a one colored light from above but the prop that actually seems to go off is many different colored lights all around. And it is possible to get multiple stars per show. I got 2 in one show the last time. Seems 100% that I get the star with the dragon and that specific box magic kit. I don&#39;t know what they do yet though. I&#39;ll try practing on it with a different monster to see if that has anything to do with it.

 It might be the shake parts. I used to run a lot of Ball parts &#40;lvl 2 of shake parts&#41; and get the stars frequently. But then, since I&#39;ve been experimenting with other props, I haven&#39;t seen them at all. That&#39;s why I thought it might be a function of the prop. <BR> <BR>Let us know if you nail it down. We&#39;re pretty sure all the props have some effect. A guy over on GF said that the Wind parts seemed to speed you up &#40;your physical movement&#41; between performances, and another prop &#40;Bomb parts?&#41; added some time to the clock... and my tests seemed to bear that out, but when I tried some of the other parts, I didn&#39;t notice any obvious effects. Anyway, yeah, it&#39;s definitely something worth looking into.

 Actually, it seems that when you pick up the star, the prop effect &#40;colored spotlights&#41; plays outside of its normal sequence after the mini-game. I&#39;m guessing this raises satisfaction, but I&#39;m not sure. <BR>Yeah it seems to be the shake parts. <BR>But I did also notice that the wind parts increase movement speed and such, though I don&#39;t think that another prop actually gives more on the timer, because that seems to occur whenever I get a high score on a red training gadget for me. <BR>I&#39;ll test whether the clock increases for other gadgets, just to make sure though.

 This also happens with &#40;a gold star&#41; Photo Light 2... That&#39;s what I think it was called. <BR>And yeah, I guess just alot of my red level gadgets have the props that give that effect. <BR>One of them is the snow effect.

 Er, I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s just called Photo Light, it&#39;s level 1. And the other thing was a smoke effect, not a snow effect. Oops :x

 Actually, I don&#39;t think those stars do anything other than make the effect of the prop show up during the downtime &#40;when the timer is running between performances&#41;. The main thing I think it would do is it may or may not raise the audience&#39;s level of satisfaction &#40;those this is kind of difficult to test seeing as it involves testing what influences satisfaction also...&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also, the props that are in a family &#40;like being level 1, and level 2, level 3 of the same recipe&#41; seem to have similar effects. <BR>I&#39;ll look into this more when I go back to playing MR:evo though.
