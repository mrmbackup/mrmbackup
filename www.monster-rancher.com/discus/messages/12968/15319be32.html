 This is more of a mechanical question. <BR> <BR>Has anyone ever had their game work fine in a perfectly working PS2, then the game started having issues, eventually resulting in the game freezing during people talking and eventually culminating in the game playing the entire intro cinematic without a hitch, but by clicking either New game or Load game, results in a freeze? <BR> <BR>Or how about, My ps2 works FINE &#40;plays DVDs, blue disks, black discs&#41; but has the last related issue. I try using my father&#39;s PS2, same thing happens, but I take the game in to a game store to show it doesn&#39;t work, but then it PLAYS FINE ON THEIR PS2. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m very confused... any help?

 Are your PS2&#39;s the original type or the slim type?

 A combination of both, to be honest. It has a REALLY wierd story, so please bear with me on this.  <BR> <BR>I got the game BRAND NEW. I was playing it in my slim PS2 and was doing fine in it and got to the first adenture. During one of my plays, when I went to sit down, I kicked the stool that the PS2 was on and it, of course, fell off. The disk came loose and the turntable was still spinning, leading me to believe that I may have damaged the disk. Well, I cleaned the disk off with a very soft cloth and tried playing again and the game worked fine. <BR> <BR>I got up to the boss battle against the person who uses the cat thing in the first adventure &#40;the Maya, I believe?&#41;. Well, I lost as I did not have any clue what the monster was good in. However, when I went back into the game, I found that the game would freeze upon trying to enter the adventure field. I thought that this might have been an in game glitch and just decided to train my monsters longer. Then I went into the town and the game would freeze whenever I&#39;d try to talk to someone, resulting in me being locked in the conversation, able to move the camera, but the text box would never appear. <BR> <BR>Then it got even worse to the worst state possible. I can start the system, it knows what the game is, it starts the game, plays the opening cinematic perfectly fine, but when I tried to Load a game, it went to a black screen and Froze there. I tried wiping my memory card of the MRE data and startign a new game, and instead it goes to a white screen and freezes. <BR> <BR>So, I went ot try it on my father&#39;s Slim PS2, same thing. <BR> <BR>I went to a game store to have the disk cleaned &#40;sanded and buffed of scratches&#41; and before I even did that, they put it in the system they had &#40;an origional shape&#41; and it played the game fine, even bypassing the glitches I had of conversation errors. <BR> <BR>Well, I had it cleaned anyway and tried it again, playing it fine in the origional shape. <BR> <BR>Then I took it home and tried it on mine... froze like usual at the load/new game selection. my father&#39;s, same thing. Both systems able to play any other disk just fine at that time, including blue disks. <BR> <BR>Then, my father eventually replaced his PS2 with an origional shape... and it did not work in it. <BR> <BR>I took the game to another store and it started for them in a slim line one... <BR> <BR>Currently, I&#39;m under the impression that I have a cursed game as it chooses to work for anyone BUT me. <BR> <BR>The disk is perfectly clean and has no flaws in it that can be seen with the naked eye, other then some small scratches that are seen with games now and then, usually used, but have never caused issues.

 Ok, I dunno. I was thinking that if you had original PS2s you may have had the disc problems that caused Sony to be sued and replace millions of original PS2 units. <BR> <BR>You may wish to keep an eye out for s cheap used copy of the game....

 Well, we just got a new PS2, or rather, a refurbished one with an ultra powerful laser reader, and while games that couldn&#39;t be read before now work, Evo does not work. Doing the same thing as letting the whole intro run without a hiccup, but freezing at a white screen of death whenever a new game is started. <BR> <BR>So... Yeah... I&#39;m gonna look for a new game.
