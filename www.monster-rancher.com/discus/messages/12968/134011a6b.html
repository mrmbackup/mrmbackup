&#42;&#42;&#42;Page Under Construction&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>There are five different types of Consumables: Food, Treat, Medicine, Combined, and Consumable. These items may be asked for by your trainers in order to help them bond with their monsters, relieve fatigue, and so on. These can be created at certain item shops over the course of the game using the &#34;Material&#34; items, or sometimes purchased outright at a shop. Each type of consumable comes in four different levels, with each higher level being of better quality. <BR> <BR>Although recipes are included with the various items, keep in mind that to create them in-game you need to not only find an item shop that will combine these items, but you must find the recipe itself in the game as well. The recipes are included more as an indication of what materials you should collect and save if you want to create the Consumables later on. <BR> <BR>Foods are the actual prepared dishes, ready for consumption by your monster. These shouldn&#39;t be confused with food-type materials, which are used in combination to form the finished dish. <BR> <BR>Food: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD><B>Food Name</B></TD><TD><B>Description</B></TD><TD><B>Recipe</B></TD><TD><B>Cost</B> </TD></TR><TR><TD>MeatDishLv:1</TD><TD>A basic meat dish.

 I&#39;ve been playing for almost 1 game year and nobody&#39;s asked me for any food.  Are my monsters never hungry?

 Well, apparently Albert feeds them their normal food, anything they ask for is above and beyond that. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t start getting requests for food or anything else until the time I got my fifth trainer. &#40;Trying to be non spoily as possible...&#41; Once they joined, they started asking for a specific item to help them form a bond with their monster. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m suspecting &#40;just suspecting, so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s confirmed or anything ;&#41; &#41; that you&#39;ll get requests when one monster is seriously behind all others in its bonding &#40;by that time all my other monsters had a great bond, since I hadn&#39;t switched any of them to new monsters yet&#41;, or when you start using the higher-level gadgets that have a better chance of really stressing out or tiring the monsters.

 a couple notes on asking for food and larox etc. <BR> <BR>bonding = larox apparently I have numerous monster/trainer combos ask for larox to strengthen bonding, especially with 1st generation monsters <BR> <BR>the mosters fed by the other members of the circus &#40;they bring this up in one of of the little tutorial breaks early on&#41; <BR>I did not see any requests for anything aside from larox until finishing the story line in warp. since then as a I move around some cities seem to have a few different effects &#40;ie in colno at the start of a week the other members of the circus will have a conversation about how hot it is and will say something aobut a specific trainers mosnter. if you talk to that trainer in the tent &#40;they will not have the little ! over their heads either&#41; he will request an item to deal with the heat &#40;cant remeber which it is off the top of my head&#41;. there are a few of these I have seen in various cities and they always pop up at the beginning of a week. <BR> <BR>also on occasion I will see the ! later in a mosters career and it usually deals with fatigue, which the trainer will ask for something specifc again

 My 5th trainer asked for Larox every week on his newly-made monster... and I noticed that while her bonding/stats did not seem to change, she did become motivated 1.5X faster than the others, despite being a 1st gen...

 It is pretty typical for a new monster&#39;s trainer to ask for Larox. <BR> <BR>In fact, if you check your own monster each week &#40;when you get a new one&#41;, you ask yourself to get it a Larox. <BR> <BR>I just now had occassion to do this. It has no effect on motivation, but my monster&#39;s Bonding went from 30 before I handed over the Larox, to 31 after. <BR> <BR>From this, I&#39;m going to say it has a negligible but existent affect on bonding. I doubt you&#39;d do any damage by missing/skipping it, but it&#39;s free bonding, so.

 Ordinarily in this game you don&#39;t have to feed your monsters. If your trainers have a ! over their heads, or if you talk to your monster and it wants something, you have a chance to go get it &#40;if you can&#41;, then the next time you talk to the trainer &#40;or your monster&#41;, you will give it to them automatically.
