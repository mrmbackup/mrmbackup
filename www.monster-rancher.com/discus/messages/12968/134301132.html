 So far, I&#39;ve gotten two events with a fortune teller. You are given a riddle and have to solve it to get a bonus. <BR> <BR>One was about mountains being grateful even for dead trees. It was suggested I buy cheap food. I went and bought one of each food and got 5,000 gold for solving it. <BR> <BR>The second one is giving me trouble. It was about using my skills and how the next 4 weeks are critical. I can&#39;t, for the life of me, figure out how to solve this. I put on a show on the 4th week &#40;the only week Albert&#39;d let me&#41; but that didn&#39;t work, as I got a scene at the end where they muse how they never figured it out. I fought a trial battle at the guild and I got similar results. What am I supposed to do? Has anyone else gotten this?

 Yeah, I&#39;ve gotten a couple of the second one you mentioned. It basically &#34;runs away with your money&#34; &#40;about 20-30k&#41;. Albert always says that he&#39;s going to talk to the mayor or something, but in the end, I think he says that they can&#39;t find the fortune teller and you lose your money. Whenever this happens, I just load the game lol.

 Actually on the second one, it is putting on a show, but maybe the fourth week is just too late to do it. Or maybe you have to reach a certain satisfaction or something similar - maybe use gadgets for some of your monsters that really suit their &#40;or their trainers&#39;&#41; skills? I just know that putting on the show seemed to be the key. <BR> <BR>I do remember that before I put on the show, I went back into the tent after the meeting and talked to Albert. He was the one that mentioned that about how your skills are basically entertaining the crowd, and I think may have suggested the show. It&#39;s possible that maybe you have to talk to him?

 I talked to him and he suggested putting on the show. I put it on and got the performance guy dancing &#40;though it wasn&#39;t the best performance rating&#41;. I still failed. So, either I have to put the show on earlier than that &#40;which means I have to reload to the save BEFORE I got the fortune teller and hope it shows up again&#41; or I have to get as high of an approval rate as I possibly can. I&#39;ll try getting a higher approval rate first, though.

 Okay, I got an approval rating of 88 and still failed. So unless I need a PERFECT score, it means that I needed to do it by the 3rd so that they could reflect on it on the 4th week. So, I need to reload and hope it shows up again!

 I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t have a perfect score. ;&#41; At that time in the game I wasn&#39;t even getting 88s yet. Like I said, either it was too late, or maybe it has to do with the tricks you use being suited to the trainers&#39; skills in general &#40;or to the monsters&#39; skills&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Let us know, and good luck!

 I always gave the monsters tricks that their trainer wanted. This was my team: <BR> <BR>Marlene had a Ripper that was combatative. She suggested intelligence type acts, so I had her juggle. The training method was Hard. <BR> <BR>Tico had his Maya, who was competetive. He wanted speed acts, so I had him on that spiral thing. The training method was Normal. <BR> <BR>Gaufre had a Dragon, who was competetive. He wanted power acts, so I had him on the Baku Lift. The training method was Normal the first time I tried, and then Easy after that as it&#39;s his default. <BR> <BR>Julio had a Tiger, who was cool. I changed his trick twice. The first time he was on Drums, the second time he was on the Spiral &#40;Speed, as Tigers are known for Speed&#41;. I had him on Normal policy. <BR> <BR>I kept retrying the act and I kept failing. For the final time, I bought the medium levels of all the acts that corresponded with their preferences: propeller &#40;speed&#41;, barrel throw &#40;power&#41;, magic box &#40;intelligence&#41;, with Tiger on Drums and then Spiral. This was how I got the 88 performance and I still failed. I&#39;m strongly starting to suspect that I was just putting on the show too late. Rather, I had to put it on by the 3rd so that they could reflect on the show the 4th day. I ended up reloading from an earlier save and it hasn&#39;t reappeared yet. :&#40;

 I tried it in the 3rd week and still got them saying they hadn&#39;t figured it out. :&#40; <BR>Maybe I didn&#39;t have my satisfaction high enough; at the time I was still using all the low level acts. Still, that one is annoying!

 I can&#39;t even seem to get it to activate now! Do you, by any change, remember where you where when it activated? Story wise, I mean? Or what you did? <BR> <BR>The first time I got it, I was just before the tournament in Campana. Now I can&#39;t activate it again. I tried to go through the tournament, thinking maybe it was after but it still won&#39;t activate.

 Well, I finally have an update on my fortune teller problem. I managed to get it again in Campana, before having entered the tournament. You won&#39;t believe how many times I had to reset to get this. ;&#41; I had to skip doing a show, and that&#39;s when it happened. <BR> <BR>I was able to put the show on the very next week, and I got the &#39;good&#39; ending to the event! So you definitely have to do it either on week 2 or week 3 of the timelimit, as the final week has to be used for getting the update. I got a lot of money out of the deal, too!
