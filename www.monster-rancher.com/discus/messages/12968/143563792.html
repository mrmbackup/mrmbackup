 Yay!I beat her&#40;I&#39;m saying that the Maya Is a her,not tico&#41;!It was a challenge,but I succeeded.With the union attack I tapped down all Triange,Square,Circle,and X button at the same time,and was able to hit over 100,and It was smooth sailing from then on.Hah-hah,and peopleay that button mashing Is mindless.

 Well,I&#39;m In the adventure where you go through the factory,and I got to the boss,wich was a gigantic Mock with over 1000 life.Wasn&#39;t able to beat&#39;em though,because my Monster that I had left barely had any life,but I&#39;ll try again.Perhaps maybe fire moves would hit hard on the mock,because It Is a tree and all.And It does have some RPG elements to It.My Dragon,wich Is a Paper Dragon&#40;Dragon/???&#41;wich I named stone that knows a fire-breathing attack,so I&#39;ll try that out.

I&#39;m not 100% sure, but I had just a regular Dragon that knew gravity zero and had a 7 pow and a 6 acc that took it out in 2 hits. <FONT FACE="WINGDINGS">&#75;</FONT>

 Well,I taught my Dragon/??? the attack,&#34;Inferno&#34;,I used It repetitively,almost close to knocking It out.But the Mock knocked out my Dragon/???,and the only one I had left was my Lessieorca,wich I named,&#34;Jonah&#34;,It&#39;s a Lessione/???,In the end,I got up close,hit the mock with &#34;Slap&#34;,and knocked him out.I was shocked when he screamed and fell over.I would of love to brought that Mock with me,but you can&#39;t get any Mocks In MR Evo,oh well.My Lessieorca got over like 3,000 to 4,000 anima points from defeating the Mock,and I&#39;m not lying about that one.If I had a camera,I&#39;d post a pic.

 Yeah, just wait till Moo. My ChuraMaya Maya/Pixie almost got  <BR>10,000 or something in that area &#40;I think to pinpoint it it was  <BR>somewhere in the 13,630&#39;s&#41;. My Carakorus Dragon/Beacklon  <BR>barely did 500 damage to him even with a lvl 17 pow. But my  <BR>ChuraMaya had  lvl 23 spd so it was able to dodge most of his  <BR>attacks.

 Yeah,my Full breed Piroro&#40;wich I named,&#34;Dove&#34;&#41;,had a good defense stat,making him block most of Mock&#39;s attacks.I like Piroro&#39;s Machine Fist attack.It&#39;s a good strategy for picking away at your opponent&#39;s life without having to worry about them dodging the attacks,but the strategy Is at Its best when It has a high amount of guts.

 Well now,I&#39;m In Campana,went Into the Underground Campana,got to the end,and faced off against the boss.Wich came out to be one of my favorite Monsters,a Monol.Wich Is a very big Monol&#40;and It&#39;s cel shaded!&#41;.I like how It used piecces of himself to form a mace,and that spikey wheel.Well,I didn&#39;t beat It,because I tried getting up close to him,so I kind of gave him an opportunity to attack,wich was a flaw In my strategy.Since now I can just teleport to the end thanks to that Bajarl,I&#39;ll be able to fight him at full strength.

 Well,I beat the Monol.He didn&#39;t seem to difficult.What makes a little bit easy Is that he doesn&#39;t dodge or block attacks,but some attacks will end up hitting 0.Looks like he&#39;s another monster that screems when he&#39;s defeated.Now I&#39;m In Tounge Bool,and soon I&#39;ll go In the adventure In Tounge Bool.

 He attacks? Wow. I didn&#39;t know. I gave him time to attack but he didn&#39;t do anything. Well it might have something to do with my Corakarous with a lvl 22 pow and 19 acc. &#40;If your wondering why this Corakarous&#39;s stats are higher than the stats I posted before the answer is this one is a 2nd gen. monster and the other one is a 4th gen monster.&#41; You might say it was stupid to already have a 2nd gen. monster by this point but it&#39;s actullay a little better since his stats start higher.

 Yup,that big monol attacks.One of his attacks Is where he first transforms Into a spikey wheel,and then turn Into a mace and smashes his opponents.Another attack he uses Is called,&#34;Judgement&#34;,and that&#39;s when he transforms Into a hand and flicks or slaps a monster&#40;I don&#39;t remember If It was slapping or flicking,but IT was either one&#41;.And you know how he makes that face when you defeat him?Well,he makes that face when he attacks,but don&#39;t remember what the attack was,but I know he still made the face.Well,I got to the big joker boss.I don&#39;t remember Its name,but It eas something like Daja or Baja,but I think It was Daja.Anyhow,the first time I fought him I didn&#39;t win,since my monsters were low on life,I fought him again,and got him extremely low,but then he attacked the monster I had left,and I lost.I&#39;ll write down my monster&#39;s stats and post them here,as long as I remember to.

 As for my monsters,none of them I had to retire&#40;you know, where It reaches Its life span limit.I didn&#39;t want to get you confused because Nayuta says,&#34;retire&#34;,when your Monster gets Injured&#41;.The Piroro breed can learn some nice moves.One of them Is &#34;Crown Waltz&#34; wich Is a attack that Increases the hit rate,while another called,&#34;Cracker&#34;,can make a monster confused.Then there&#39;s &#34;Machine Fists&#34; that can&#39;t be dodged,but blocked.And barely any monsters can block&#40;except for JackIntheCho&#41;.But I thinka Durahan/Ducken was able to block It though.So It&#39;s not Impossible to block.

 The starter Pioro? I never had much experience with one. I played the game through with a Pioro a Dragon a Pixie and a Maya but I din&#39;t know how to get them new moves. It wasn&#39;t until I was just paying it again recently that I noticed how to get them new moves with the Anima. ?_?
