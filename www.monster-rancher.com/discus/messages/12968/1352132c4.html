 Caveat - I haven&#39;t tried it since I was pretty much just playing to get to the end of the story. <BR> <BR>If you fast-forward a few weeks after the closing credits, the King and Queen of Warp World show up and tell you about the discovery of a hidden passage in the castle that emits frightening noises. Since Julio is Mr. Big-shot Monster Trainer, he naturally asks him to investigate.  <BR> <BR>I turned my game off at this point, but I assume that if you go to the schedule on the following week that you&#39;ll be able to schedule an adventure that will take you to the nameless corridor.

 just a schedule an adventure <BR>after beating the game every time you go on an adventure you will have the option to go to the nameless corridors first then if you say no you will go to the adventure for what ever town your in. <BR>the difficulty of all adventures goes up in order <BR>colno is the easiest &#40;slightly tougher than warp in story&#41; ascending to warp then nameless as the toughest <BR>nameless has roughly 5 levels of difficulty and they are random . meaning the first map you see may very well have the toughest monsters you see instead of the normal 1st map easy last map hard pattern from the story adventures. you can see monsters with around 2300 health and jack in the cho&#39;s are far more dangerous here then anywhere else. after going through between 5-8 levels you will encounter a random uber boss. if yo ubeat him you can repeat the whole process again

 From what I was able to discern is that the strength of the Nameless dungeon is in direct porortion to the stregnth of the town you are in. So if you are in one of the earlier towns the Nameless dungeon would be easier but a later town would be a tougher dungeon.

 It seems to me that the nameless cloister dungeon keeps on going. You do after a while come to an area that has nothing in it and once you cross a certain point your in a boss battle. Also i found that all the book cards im finding are of ? subtypes.

 The Nameless Cloister sucks bigtime in my opinion. I spent 4 hours there to beat it fighting tons of bosses. I had one monster maxed with 9,999 in every stat and it still took that long. After all that time you fight a red Moo and then the depressing warp chick with no personality shows up to talk with you. She is impressed that you made it that far and offers you a reward. Her stupid rewards are a L Power Gadget, L Intelligence Gadget, Rare Card or you can choose nothing and she&#39;ll tell you how noble you are. This is a seriously dissappointing reward for such hard work. She tells you a little more about how the warp people lost hope and then says that you must be tired and that she can use her magic to send you back to town and it&#39;s all over. Hours and Hours of fighting for nothing. So unless you really want to see a Red Glowing Moo with Orange Speckles all over him I don&#39;t suggest trying to beat the whole dungeon. Just get the cards you need and get out. But maybe there is someone out there who really wants to see a red Moo LOL who knows.

 Any hope that cool things will occasionally happen like in MR2, where there were so many extra events?  Or not.  It seems like you still get a few things, like a rival circus and stuff... does this continue? or are these things I never did in the first place?  I just wonder if its worth working in the finished game, or if I should play it again, to try different things...

 Is the rare card she offers you anything special, like a guaranteed /? you&#39;re missing, or is it just a random rare? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been through as many as five bosses in the corridor, but there&#39;re still a couple I can&#39;t take &#40;Moo/AnimaEater&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also, there was a rumor a while back that you could get rare boss pictures/cards if you had a full book... anybody know anything about that? &#40;I&#39;m still at about 146/246 in the book, haven&#39;t gotten around to filling it yet.&#41; <BR> <BR>There&#39;s plenty to do in the post-game, I&#39;ve been hunting the Bromides... I&#39;m pretty sure 34-53 are the gadget photos, and the seven &#40;or more&#41;? before that are the PC photos you get for maxing the fame in each area &#40;I have 3 left to go&#41;. But that still leaves quite a few Bromides unaccounted for... maybe there&#39;s some boss photos? Not sure...

 Sorry I don&#39;t know what card. Because I used my AR MAx to fill the book so I choose nothing and she just told me how noble I was for not being selfish. and OMG honey there are way more than 5 bosses there you wouldn&#39;t believe how many. I fought those darn creey Jokers so many times. Yuck I like their Cool Scythes but they are Ugly in my opinion. like I said even with a maxed monster with 9,999 in every stat I still took 4 hours to get through. I never heard anything about the boss cards. I think I have all the cards and Bromides I will check later and see.

 After you go through it and fight all the bosses in the NC, can you go through again and get the reward for finishing it again?
