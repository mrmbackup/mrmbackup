 I was thinking of going through the game new and writing down all the monster Disks you can pick up from the stores in game.  If anyone has an opinion please share it I would like some feedback as to rather this would interest anyone or not.

 I am also thinking of making an enemy monsters list &#40;non guild mission&#41; for each of the areas so you know roughly what monsters are there.  Any feedback would be appreciated

 I will see what i can do.  I believe that the selection changes at key points in the game but i am not sure.  later today i will get to work on what monsters you can get from the disk shops.  Also if anyone wants an enemy monster list i can write one of those up to.  I will have to check to see if HP changes depending on how many monsters are fighting or not.

 This would be great. <BR> <BR>A couple things I&#39;ve noticed: The adventure monsters change from week to week or adventure to adventure, for instance, sometimes you&#39;ll get a lot of a certain sub-type, so like on one trip to Warp it&#39;ll be a lot of joker subs, on another it&#39;ll be a lot of dragon subs, or zan subs. <BR> <BR>About the saucer shops, I&#39;ve noticed the selection changes somewhat from week to week, but I also think that area fame is a factor, especially for opening the /?s in the shop. I could be wrong, though. <BR> <BR>Good luck!

 I&#39;ll help you out.  Here&#39;s the data I have on /??? Disks. <BR> <BR>Big Tokobot &#40;Golem/???&#41; <BR>Found: Grabad, 3Yr, 7Mo, 3 Wk. <BR> <BR>PieRipper &#40;Ripper/???&#41; &#40;Note: Pie stands for Pirate&#41; <BR>Found: Grabad, 3Yr, 9Mo, 3Wk. <BR> <BR>Yes, I&#39;m still not very far in the game.  I can&#39;t get the free time.  Even now, I can&#39;t get focussed enough for DDMR.  It&#39;s not the working person&#39;s game, espeically when they work night shift ^_^;  In any case, a little clue I HAVE found, or THINK I&#39;ve found at least, is that certain disks are annual.  Once they&#39;ve appeared, they should be there the same time next year.

 I don&#39;t like double-posting, but as for Area Fame, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an issue.  When I got these Disks, I was still pretty fresh in the game, and definitely no more than a 30 Fame, if that &#40;probably closer to 20 or even 15&#41;.  I&#39;d put on about 8 shows in the starting town, and then no more than 2 in Grabad.  Good luck in finding out if there IS a trigger for /??? Discs, though.

 ah well that will be helpful since i am only going through the story mode and listing the ones that show up.  I think the ones that show up in story are preset and then after you beat the game they become more randomized.

 Also I need to know If i should do a new topic with the Listing that i came up with or should i post them here.  Lisa if you read this please give me your opinion of how to go about this as if my theory is correct we will have a list of Main Story based disks by the end of next week. Hopefully.

 Update2: Found out my theory is wrong.  The ones found in story mode work as follows.  The first three in the list stay the same for the area your in.  The last one one the list changes randomly.  Once i finish Chapter one i will post the list of monster saucers and include which week the change was made.

 Okay First round of info. <BR>Colno Disk shop <BR>This list may still be Incomplete but it seems that it repeats after awhile. <BR>Gelotine: Mocchi/Jell 1,2,1,2,2,2 <BR>Green Suezo: Suezo/Plant 1,2,1,2,1,2 <BR>GigaBio: Golem/Gitan 2,2,1,1,2,2 <BR>Eared Mew: Mew/Hare 2,2,2,2,1,1 <BR>Eared mew was replaced with  <BR>PumpkiDuck: Ducken/Pancho 1,2,2,1,2,1 <BR>on the second week then Eared Mew Reappeared the week After. <BR>PinkGolem: Golem/Pixie 2,2,1,1,2,2 <BR>Appeared after the first meeting with the mayor.  Major Events don&#39;t seem to affect the time the disks change.  PinkGolem Replaced the Eared Mew who returned after the second meeting with the mayor. <BR>HawkClaw: Piroro/Raiden 1,2,2,2,2,1 <BR>Replaced Eared Mew after the Violet Cats meeting. <BR>Janne: Pixie/Durahan 1,2,2,2,1,1 <BR>Replaced HawkClaw The week after Hawkclaw appeared. &#40;First Week of March&#41;. <BR> <BR>To Sum up just the list itself its <BR>Gelotine: Mocchi/Jell 1,2,1,2,2,2 <BR>Green Suezo: Suezo/Plant 1,2,1,2,1,2 <BR>GigaBio: Golem/Gitan 2,2,1,1,2,2 <BR>Eared Mew: Mew/Hare 2,2,2,2,1,1 <BR>PumpkiDuck: Ducken/Pancho 1,2,2,1,2,1 <BR>HawkClaw: Piroro/Raiden 1,2,2,2,2,1 <BR>Janne: Pixie/Durahan 1,2,2,2,1,1 <BR> <BR>Let me know if you have any questions Sorry if this list is a little confusing just wanted everyone to know when the changes occured.  Also incase your wondering i checked Every week when i was able to.

 Hmm strange.  Now that i got up to the end of the forest it seems to have added another one to the mix. <BR>Battle Rocks: Golem/Durahan 2,1,1,1,2,2 <BR>This replaced the Janne by the way.

 Also now have a  <BR>Sol: Jell/Garu 2,2,2,1,2,1 <BR>That came up two weeks after the Golem.  Hmm I wonder what determines the rate on which a particular monster species holds up.  I am definately right in one assumption that the top three monsters are always the same however as there has not been one change to them at all. <BR>Oh and by the way for anyone that thinks this is a tad messy I will be cleaning it up when i get each section done unless someone else takes the liberty first.

 Much to my dismay another monster has shown its ugly head. <BR>Mochimew: Mew/Mocchi 2,2,2,2,1,2 <BR>I hope it doesn&#39;t change to another new one next week or else i am gonna end up spaming this board.  Sorry.  I am going to do the next chapter.  if anyone wants to add more to this list for the first town make sure you can prove that you found it in that town and only during the main story not after beating moo.  I believe the appearance rates change when you beat the main game.  And again sorry if it seems like i am spaming this part of the board. <BR> <BR>Good thing i didn&#39;t post this yet. <BR>Turns out theres another one that is showing up now <BR>Battleleon Garu/Durahan 2,1,2,2,2,1

 To clean up the First cities List of disks that appeared.  I have seen the following: <BR>Gelotine: Mocchi/Jell 1,2,1,2,2,2  <BR>Green Suezo: Suezo/Plant 1,2,1,2,1,2  <BR>GigaBio: Golem/Gitan 2,2,1,1,2,2  <BR>Eared Mew: Mew/Hare 2,2,2,2,1,1  <BR>PumpkiDuck: Ducken/Pancho 1,2,2,1,2,1  <BR>HawkClaw: Piroro/Raiden 1,2,2,2,2,1  <BR>Janne: Pixie/Durahan 1,2,2,2,1,1  <BR>Battle Rocks: Golem/Durahan 2,1,1,1,2,2 <BR>Sol: Jell/Garu 2,2,2,1,2,1 <BR>Mochi Mew: Mew/Mocchi 2,2,2,2,1,2  <BR>Battleleon: Garu/Durahan 2,1,2,2,2,1  <BR>There Maybe more but those are the ones that seemed to appear for me.  Remember this list is from Story mode.  Once the story is complete i am not sure if there is a change or not.

 I have a question... i played for about a year and never saw a Battle Rocks... but it might have appeared when i was doing a show that week. I wonder why. How many times did you see it. I just wanna know to confirm my curiosity. But I think I saw a Mocchi/Raiden just to add. And I don&#39;t remember a Hawk Claw there either. I don&#39;t know. Maybe I left to early or something.
