 I threw a Wisp into a Knife kit with a tech tank s, i noticed 2 big diffences then with out the prop.  <BR> <BR>1st, the minigame had a new symbol, one that could speed up or down the wheel of symbols. <BR> <BR>2nd thing i noticed, but i&#39;ll have to check this a tad more, i Got a silver coing and atleast 1 maybe more bronze coins&#40;was in a rush to the next game&#41;.  Keep in mind the green egg i had just done and the green one i did right after it, both perfect 5 combos, only gave me 500. Anyone else do anything with props?

 I too noticed this about adding props to the gadgets. I also noticed that when adding a more spectactular prop to the gadget it often raised the level of the prop as well as provided more money. In a sense I guess this makes sense as it provides a better show for the crowd so they then throw more money. I have been trying to get better props by combining but getting the recepie can be hard. So far I have gotten only three combined recepies for props. My latest one is one that uses balloons but I haven&#39;t used it yet though.

 A little late to the party on this thread, but I noticed something interesting when I was experimenting in the gadget shop. <BR> <BR>When I added a prop, the combine menu showed a &#34;press &#42;square&#42; to see max stats&#34; notice. Pressing the &#42;square&#42; button caused the listed stats to increase a bit. Gadgets without props didn&#39;t get that message. <BR> <BR>The implication would seem to be that a prop can add a bonus amount to the training capacity of a gadget.

 actually that max stat listing is for when your monster is doing level 3 performances with it &#40;ie level 1 is the lowest 3 is the highest&#41;

 The only time I&#39;ve seen the &#39;max stats&#39; note has been with a lvl 3 gadget/lvl 2 tank.  Lvl 3 gadgets/lvl 1 tanks have not given me the message. <BR> <BR>&#40;SI&#41;

 doesnt matter  <BR>you can have a drum kit with a life tank s on it and ther is a difference  <BR>you take a new born regardless of generation and put them on the drum it will be level 1 &#40;as seen on the information tab in the meetings&#41;  <BR>of course sometimes you monster will grow enough during that time &#40;especially with higher generation monsters&#41; that the training gadget will show up as a level 2 before thier first performance. and eventually it will become level 3 when your monster is getting full benefit from the gadget <BR> <BR>this can been seen a number of ways but the best way is by looking at the arrow increase when putting your monster on the gadget. at level 1 it will get minimum arrows for the gadget in question. as level 2 it will be slightly better and at level 3 it will be max number of arrows. <BR> <BR>also you can see the difference in performance as the actual mini game played will become harder with level and the animation for success will be different &#40;barrel toss for example at level 1 there is only one bar to throw over but at level 3 there are 4&#41; <BR>  <BR>example: you take a swing kit that has 5 large arrows up in power as its max stats. put a brand new monster on it and he will get around 3 1/2 large arrows &#40;or there abouts&#41; as he grows older the amount of arrows increases and eventually even a 1st gen monster will get the full benefit of 5 big arrows in power. <BR>hope that helps

 btw props do seem to add a small bonus to the gadget...havnt really figured out if there are specifc combos that work better. <BR>to me it seem universally based on prop level ie a light p2 and laser p2 will add the same bonus. <BR> <BR>will look into this some more but I am only using 3 or 4 props at this point: star, globe , sound and bomb all are level 3 props except globe which is level 4

 after doing some testing last night props do not add anything stat wise but do raise the level of the gadget they are being added to  <BR> <BR>this also increases how much coin the audience will throw out for successful performances

 Don&#39;t forget that it just over all makes the performance look cooler my favorite is the swing with the prop that causes sparks to fly out from the corners of it.  The angle the camera is set at during it makes it look really spectacular.  Just my two cents worth on props.
