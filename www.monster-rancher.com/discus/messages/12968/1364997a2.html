 I know I read somewhere on here someone who wanted to know if there were enemy monster Cards or Brimides. Though now I don&#39;t see the post &amp; I know I posted a reply that I&#39;d look into it using my Action Replay. Obviously I don&#39;t have any enemy monsters in the Book which is sad I liked that feature in MR2. There are sadly no enemy cards in the Bromides I have either. I have 53 which I assume is all because I haven&#39;t found any others but I could be wrong. Bromides # 1-25 are Monsters Bromides# 26-33 are your characters and Bromides# 34-53 are all gadgets. I hope I am proven wrong by the game someday and that you can possibly get Bromides with Enemy Monsters.

 Well I see now that some posts were deleted including one of mine in which I didn&#39;t say anything wrong. So maybe thats why I can&#39;t find what I&#39;m looking for. Do you guys at least wait until the person has gotten an answer to their question before deleting it? That seems awfully rude to me. Maybe it was deleted because I said Tecmo used awful Font,which is true it&#39;s very hard to read. Though I&#39;ve seen many things which seemed more offensive to me so I&#39;m just wondering why my post about Drabitt and the post I was trying to find to reply too seem to have disappeared.

 Good info on the Bromides. I wonder how the monster bromides are unlocked in game... possibly when you&#39;ve raised a certain number of them? Hrm. <BR> <BR>About your posts. The Drabitt post was deleted because I corrected the problem, so it served no other purpose. Your other post was not deleted, but moved into the MR:EVO Miscellaneous Q &amp; A section. I will also move this thread there. Just to keep things tidy. Nobody did anything wrong.

 For anyone with AR MAX I have listed the code to get all Bromides. I have also listed addintional codes for getting all the illegal and Legend Items as well. I will try to post GameShark codes as well soon. However I don&#39;t have a Gameshark so I will need someone with a GameShark to confirm the codes.

 Scorpio, go back and re-read the Office of the Mayor. <BR> <BR>This is not an archive of everything anyone ever posted. We only retain posts with actual, useful game information that other players can use.

 It was just  question Lisa and I think there are quite a few posts here that no longer hold usefull info. Why is it that it seems like everything makes you mad. Like the poor girl who just wanted to have the monsters be able to breed. and you yelled at her because Monster Rancher games would never contain SEX. I think thats a vaild thing to want for the monsters to be able to breed. She simplay wanted all the things Poke&#39;mon allow you to have. Like being able to choose between a male and female trainer. I&#39;ve had a bad enough week after being assualted by 2 Police officers just because I&#39;m half black I don&#39;t need this either. I did nothing wrong I just wondered why psots are disappearing left and right. I&#39;ve read the office of the Mayor and there is no need for me to read it again. There&#39;s no need for sarcasim. But I suppose i order for you to believe that too you&#39;d want pics of my body covered in bruises. It&#39;s hard enough trying to have a normal life and trying to figure out where to find a lawyer with enough &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; to take on our Police department. My video games are a way to get away from the nasty people I encounter over and over in my life. I am disabaled and I&#39;m going to have to go back into physiacl therapy for what they did to me. Don&#39;t believe Milwaukee police are that bad Just Google the words Frank Jude. I just asked a question.

 There&#39;s only so much I can get done in a day. And, since most of the mods have moved on to other games, I am stuck doing a lot more than in the past, in terms of technical support on the site. If you want more deletions on some sort of schedule, then send me enough money to hire staff, or stop whining. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry that you don&#39;t understand that this isn&#39;t a social forum. We retain proven gameplay info and that&#39;s it. Other posts are deleted. <BR> <BR>You want me to archive more, start sending those monthly checks -preferrably before whining.
