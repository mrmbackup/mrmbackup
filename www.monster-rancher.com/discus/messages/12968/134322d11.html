 Anybody know what happens after you complete the story? Is it just complete missions, adventure,  and perform, or is there some sort of tournament mode like in previous games?

 Spoilers!! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m gonna make a list so I&#39;ll give you a few minor details I know so far, &#40;Having a little problem you&#39;ll know why&#41; <BR>Well your right about it pretty much, no tournaments, and you can move to any town in the game.  Theres better effect tanks now but there costly.   <BR> <BR>Also and possibly the best thing they did was crank up the diff of the game and not just a little.  I&#39;d say the normal adventures the monsters are a good 3, 3.5 times stronger. and theres a extra place where there double that. &#40;think 1700 hp each and there other stats are pretty good to, no way to measure though&#41; <BR> <BR>Also some random events and extra battles.  Plus the extra place gives you something pretty great but i&#39;ll hold off on that till later :&#41;

 Well this is the short suming up of a list I put together of changes after the main quest fell free to look at it if you don&#39;t mind all the Spoilers. <BR> <BR>Moving: You can now schedule to move to any of the towns.  It doesn’t take any time to move and your monsters will still train normally. Also some random events may occur. <BR> <BR>1.You’ll get a message about monsters being happy to be in a new place and motivation will go up for all your monsters 50% <BR>2.It seems they put the tent up on an old burial ground.  Split up gang and search for clues!!!! No just kidding you can’t do anything about it and your monster’s stress and fatigue go up.  <BR> <BR>Difficulty: The Monsters in adventure are about 3 times as powerful as the last level of the main quest. There hp’s are around 700 to 1000 depending on where you go.  <BR> <BR>Random events: <BR>1.Lucky lotto – A chance to win up to 200k by buying a 2k ticket. happens once or twice a year <BR> <BR>2.Rival circus challenge – a rival circus will challenge you to put on a show with 60 satisfaction or better in the next 12 weeks and you can’t go on a adventure afterwards.  Your suppose to get a prize but I was in the middle of a guild mission and when I reloaded it never happened again :p <BR> <BR>3.The prophet Lampert– A guy that looks exactly like Lambert shows up. &#40;At least Dotty and I think so&#41;   He says it’s a good omen you’re here but the next week all your monsters fatigue is up.  He can also tell about luck also.  If he says its good the monsters fatigue will go down.  <BR> <BR>4.Neder to the north – A group of researchers want some items that you give your monsters.  They give stuff in return, more as I progress.  I sent a fish dish 1 and they gave me 200g.  Supple lv2 they gave back 400g. Goods 3 they gave back 900g, and for the last they want either a book 4, 2 meat 4 or a 4 of something I didn’t know what lv4.  I didn’t have the ingredients or recipes so I just got a extra 3k <BR> <BR>Sicknesses: A monster and Marlene &#40;Not kidding, well she is a princess after all&#41; will get a sickness and if you give the item they want it will say that something good has happened to your monsters DNA &#40;no idea yet&#41; and an effect for the monster.  If you don’t stress and fatigue will increase. <BR> <BR>1.Hot day in summer – Marlene will be hot in summer and it will Dotty’s monster also.  He’ll ask for soup lv.2 and if you give it to him that week his monsters motivation will go up <BR> <BR>2.Bad medicine – Marlene will get a stomach ache and so will Dotty’s monster.  They want a Veg. lv2 to help the monster. Stress will go down for the monster.  Side note it was because some put a laxative in the monsters water. P.S. why was Marlene drinking the monster’s water? <BR> <BR>3.Cold in winter – Gaufre’s monster will get a cold and so does Marlene.  He’ll want tokiace.  If you give it to him his monsters motivation will go up. <BR> <BR>Bonus Battles <BR> <BR>1.That stupid cat: You receive a letter about a new addition to the Violent Cats and in Camaba you can fight Toro and Petty.  P.S.  When I talk about how much harder the game has gotten and S rank missions, Think of this guy. You’ve been warned.  Oh and you get a “trophee” and a champ tank L for beating him <BR> <BR>Shops: All the effect shops have more and better tanks and every part, props you need to find in Grabad.  Listed are other changes. <BR> <BR>1.Village of Colno: Effect shop is now open and the item shop can combine <BR> <BR>2.Grabad:  The item shop can now combine <BR> <BR>3.Tongue Bool: The gem exchange is open and it’s the only way to get some of the rare items and tanks. <BR> <BR>Guild missions:  All the guilds are tied together.  So you can be in Colno and they can send you on a mission you need to go to warp to and if you want, report on it anywhere you like.  There are also rare S rank missions that you have to search around to find a powerful group of monsters holding an item. There are 7 in all and you get gold and a legend or illegal equipment. There are 7 in total. <BR> <BR>1.Desert bread – You get 10k and a yellow cape for completing this.  Red orca’s send you out to find bread in the desert.  Location of the monsters holding it is right before you go up the stairs to the last part of the level there’s a dead end to right that’s pitch black.  3 monsters 2 with 9999 hp and one with 9 that’s stronger then the other  <BR> <BR>2.  Use a union attack to get rid of the one with 9 hp.  This was pretty easy since I was able to peck at the 2 with 9999 hp and take all there guts away and kill the last one with a union.  My pixie had about level 15 int and currently the only one I beat. <BR> <BR>2.Tochika girl. – You get 5k and a gold charm 4 for beating this.  In the cave you go to the lower levels in the first part all the way to the right.  There’s a bridge that leads to the other side with nothing there but at the end it starts a fight.  3 monsters with around 3000 hp and a lot of defense.  Pixie didn’t win that one. <BR> <BR> <BR>Extra Dungeon: The “Nameless Corridor” Is a random generated dungeon, the only random one in the game.  The monsters are twice as hard as the other places &#40;hp is at about 1700 and the jackinthecho’s are even worst.  The good part?  All the monster books are of /??? Monsters.   <BR> <BR> <BR>What I don&#39;t have anything about is what happens when your circus gets popular so this list is in no way complete.  So fell free to add anything.

 note on the nameless corridors.... <BR> <BR>after going through roughly 5-7 levels you will encounter a boss monster from previous sotry lines. the monster is random and a decent bit tougher than the prior version of the monster <BR> <BR>if you manage to defeat the boss the map starts over creating a new random layout to get to another boss. ie I recently went through and got king monolith killed him proceded through again got king monolith for a 2nd time killed him proceded through and got king monolith a 3rd time which he finally was able to kill 2 of 3 monsters I was exploring with. the bosses seem to drop nothing but gadget parts as a side note.
