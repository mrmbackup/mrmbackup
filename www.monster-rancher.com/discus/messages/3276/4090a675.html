 026. Tiamat &#91;Dragon/Pixie&#93; Everybody agrees on its strength, but few agree on its looks. <BR>027. Dragon &#91;Dragon/Dragon&#93; Everybody knows this legendary monster. But few can raise it.  <BR>028. Corkasus &#91;Dragon/Beaclon&#93; It is difficult to find it since it hardly leaves its homeland.  <BR>029. Tecno Dragon &#91;Dragon/Henger&#93; They say it was made with all the ancient technologies.  <BR>030. Stone Dragon &#91;Dragon/Golem&#93; It is afraid its destructive power may affect others, and hides in a cave.  <BR>031. Armor Dragon &#91;Dragon/Durahan&#93; They say it was used by humans for the ancient battles.  <BR>032. Crab Dragon &#91;Dragon/Arrow Head&#93; It inhabits the lake and rules that lake.  <BR>033. Hound Dragon &#91;Dragon/Tiger&#93; It has a habit of hiding things like a dog.  <BR>034. Gariel &#91;Dragon/Gali&#93; Its head is like holography, for it has a kind of deity.  <BR>035. Oscerot &#91;Dragon/Kato&#93; This monster keeps a collection of oil pot in his house.  <BR>036. Dodongo &#91;Dragon/Bajarl&#93; This dragon can only be seen in the desert area.  <BR>037. Gidras &#91;Dragon/Metalner&#93; This dragon has the mysterious power of Metalner.  <BR>038. Death Dragon &#91;Dragon/Joker&#93; It is said that this dragon was resurrected by Joker&#39;s power.  <BR>039. Ragnaroks &#91;Dragon/Monol&#93; They say the ancient culture might have been destroyed by it.  <BR>040. Moo &#91;Dragon/???&#93; This dreadful looking dragon hardly appears even in legends.  <BR> <BR>Study Materials: <BR>2 dragons <BR>1 armor dragon <BR>1 crab dragon <BR>1 gariel <BR>2 gidras <BR>1 tecno &#40;data&#41; <BR>2 tiamat <BR> <BR>-Number of tracks were 9, 12, 13, 14, or 15. <BR> <BR>Entry0: <BR>-all of the audio CDs had PMin=1 and PLBA=4350 while tecno had PMin=1, PSec=32 and PLBA=6750. <BR> <BR>Entry1: <BR>-PMin were either 6, 9, 10, 11, or 12. <BR>-PLBA were either 26850, 40350, 44850, 49350, or 53850. <BR> <BR>Entry2: <BR>-All Control=0x00 except for armordragon which equaled 0x04. <BR>-All PMin were 40, 42, 43, or 45. <BR>-Psec were 11, 14, 29, 31, 33, 34, 44, 47, or 50. <BR>-PLBA were 180742, 183635, 191425, 192191, 192422, 195702, 195880, 203400, or 204532. <BR> <BR>Entry3: <BR>-PMin=0 for all <BR>-PSec=2 for all <BR>-PFrame and PLBA were identical for each &#40;e.g. if PFrame was 37, PLBA was 37.&#41; <BR>-PFrame=0, 32, 33, or 37. <BR>-PLBA=0, 32, 33, or 37. <BR> <BR>Entry4: <BR>-PMin=0, 3, 4, 9, or 18. <BR>-PSec=0, 9, 22, 23, 24, 29, 34, 36, 47, or 57. <BR>-PFrame=5, 8, 20, 22, 30, 35, 47, 60, or 62. <BR>-PLBA=3397, 13372, 15095, 15210, 17630, 18587, 20060, 43097, or 83408. <BR> <BR>... <BR> <BR>2nd last entries on each: <BR>-PMin=29, 30, 33, 34, or 35. <BR> <BR>Last entries on each: <BR>-PMin=34, 36, 37, or 39. <BR> <BR>Miscellaneous &#34;Theories&#34;: <BR>-Rules of Entry0 and Entry3 applied to any audio recordings so they are ruled out as being a factor in monster selection. <BR>-Possibly Entry1, Entry2 and the last few entries affect the outcome, anything in between varied too much. <BR>-I believe that the PSec and PFrame attributes determine the stats since they are the ones that varied lots.

 Well, I&#39;ve modified PFrame on a CD, and no info changed at all.

 dgcd-24634 <BR>Fearek said that was the barcode # of the Beck Mellow Gold CD that gives Moo. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t know if this info was known yet.

 Err... it&#39;s a # on the cd itself, not the UPC, my bad.

 UPC would help since we can see the number before buying it.  I&#39;m not going to though.

 I may check the used CD locations near me, but I will check my CD to see if it is on there &#40;even though mine is NOT the right one&#41;. The research we&#39;ve done so far seems very sporadic.

 I am personally beginning to hold suspect the claim that Beck&#39;s Mellow Gold CD produces Moo in MR2. <BR>Keep in mind that this is my own personal suspicion, but I have a copy of that disc &#40;BMG edition, btw&#41;, number DGCD-24634 on the case, D102518 on the UPC and on the disc itself. <BR>Part of the cuss words in songs 3 and 11 on the back are replaced with _&#39;s &#40;I&#39;ve seen other versions with the titles replaced by @#$%^ characters&#41;. <BR>My copy of the disc produces the Magnet rare in MR1, but a Mum Mew in MR2.  And given my research fenagling with the subcode data, I have so far been unable to pull Moo off the disc. <BR>So unless Tecmo used two VERY different pressings of the same album for rares in MR1 and MR2, or if someone can produce a working copy, I am personally going to hold the claim of the origin of Moo in the US in serious doubt. <BR> <BR>Sorry for the rant.
