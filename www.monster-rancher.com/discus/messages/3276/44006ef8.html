<FONT SIZE=-1>By <B><A HREF='mailto:quincunx@moonatnoon.com'>Quincunx</A></B> on <B>Sunday, July 8, 2001 - 04:58 am</B>:</FONT><P>
In this post, I will present data obtained by burning custom CDs which were tested in the Shrine in Monster Rancher 2 in search of a correlation between track lengths and the monsters and statistics read from the CDs. <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1">Prologue:</FONT> <BR> <BR>This is purely an informational post.  While some relevant discoveries were made and hypotheses formed, there is an integral flaw in the original method that prevents the data from being used based on their subcode.  But rather than throw the data out altogether, I decided it may still be useful to other Shrine researchers. <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1">Background:</FONT> <BR> <BR>This data originates from my earliest attempts to crack the shrine program to be able to create a CD containing a specific breed of monster.  &#40;The project in its original form has been reduced to an exercise in curiosity and research for research&#39;s sake due to the discovery and popularity of CloneCD, but I am still looking into it.&#41; <BR> <BR>There is an inherent problem with the CDs I burned in this research.  When read in CloneCD, the subcode data does not correspond to what was expected.  All the CDs had two audio tracks, which would indicate there would be five entries &#40;Entry 0 = number of sessions; Entry 1 = number of tracks; Entry 2 = total burn time; Entry 3 = data for track 1; Entry 4 = data for track 2&#41;. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, the CDs have seven entries.  The last two entries do not correspond to audio tracks.  Entry 5 on one of the CDs, for example, contains this data:  AMin=5 ASec=17 AFrame=42 ALBA=23667 Zero=2 PMin=79 PSec=59 PFrame=74 PLBA=359849.  I don&#39;t understand the relevance of the first four entries, but the 79&#39;59&#34;74 could easily represent the 80-minute length of the CD &#40;it <I>is</I> an 80-minute CD-R&#41;.  And 359849 = 79&#42;60&#42;75 &#43; 59&#42;75 &#43; 74 - 150, so it matches up with the frame count. <BR> <BR>Entry 6 on the same CD contains this data:  AMin=160 ASec=0 AFrame=0 ALBA=269850 Zero=0 PMin=97 PSec=26 PFrame=66 PLBA=-11634.  No clue how this is relevant.  Maybe it is proprietary data indicating the CD was burned with X program, or on X CD-R drive, or is some kind of serial number. <BR> <BR>But I digress.  Since I don&#39;t understand these subcode entries &#40;or even how they got there&#41;, I am forced to stick with my original method of analysis.  I only looked at the subcode data because so much of the current research being done at the present time is on subcode data. <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1">Method:</FONT> <BR> <BR>I began this experiment by burning a reference CD to use as a control.  I ripped two audio tracks &#40;tracks 5 and 6 from the Orb CD &#34;Cydonia&#34;&#41; into .wav files.  I then burned an audio CD on my Backpack CD-Rewriter-4E 2.6C using Adaptec&#39;s Easy CD Creator onto a Memorex 80-minute CD-R containing these two audio tracks. <BR> <BR>For each of the other 18 CDs burned, one or more &#40;or, in the case of the second CD burned, none&#41; of the properties of the CD were changed.  Properties changed included contents of the audio tracks, their order and their lengths. <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1">Data and Analysis:</FONT> <BR> <BR>I have combined these two parts of the post so that I can explain my method and analyze the results as they are shown.  Since there is a large amount of data, I feel this will be more useful then posting all the data, then analyzing it afterward.  Plus, it&#39;s less likely to leave you scratching your head wondering, &#34;Why did he burn that CD?&#34; <BR> <BR>Note:  CDs have been assigned a label according to the order they were burned in, from CD-01 &#40;the initial control CD&#41; to CD-19 &#40;the last CD burned&#41;.  The filenames of the .wav files indicate the name of the track from the source CD, &#34;Egnable&#34; and &#34;Firestar&#34;; numbers have been appended to the end of filenames to indicate modified versions of the original files. <BR> <BR>First, the control CD, designed for quick burn time. <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>CD-01</TD><TD>1&#41; Egnable</TD><TD>1&#39;59.47&#34; </TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>2&#41; Firestar</TD><TD>0&#39;46.03&#34; </TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>Total time</TD><TD>2&#39;45.50&#34;</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Shrining results: <BR>Frozen Gaboo &#91;Gaboo/Tiger&#93; <BR>Stats:  150/154/90/100/175/40 <BR>Form:  Normal  Nature:  Best <BR>Likes:  Potato  Dislikes:  Cup Jelly <BR>Attacks:  Chop, Slap <BR> <BR>Thought process:  What happens if I burn an identical CD?

How did <I>that</I> happen? <BR> <BR>Thought process:  I took a second look at the CD that created the Hare Hound.  There were major changes from the original CD-01, including the total number of whole minutes of burn time, the number of whole minutes in the second track. <BR> <BR>This is where I stopped the experiment.  I had fully planned to continue it further, but I realized I needed time to regroup and collect my thoughts.  I then made my other major research post, How the MR2 Shrine Program Generates Stats for Monsters from CDs: Initial Research. <BR> <BR>Now that I understand a bit more about CloneCD and realize the 19 CDs I burned for this experiment are &#34;malformed&#34; in their subcode with the extra entries in the TOC, I decided to post the original data as is, because continuing with this malformed data won&#39;t help with research in CloneCD, which is where I plan to move my research to.  I will take the knowledge from this research with me. <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1">Conclusion:</FONT> <BR> <BR>I have drawn the following hypotheses from this research: <BR> <BR>&#149; The attacks, form and nature, likes and dislikes are not determined from the CD subcode data &#40;other than that which determines the actual breed&#41;, but the statistics &#40;Power, Life, etc.&#41; are. <BR> <BR>&#149; The unit of time that appears to make changes in the monster is one second, since smaller tweaks produced identical monsters. <BR> <BR>&#149; Tweaking the length of the first track &#40;and thus, the total burn time&#41; within a narrow range changed the sub breed, but kept the main breed constant <BR> <BR>&#149; Tweaking the length of the second track &#40;and thus, the total burn time&#41; within a narrow range left the main and sub breeds the same, but produced new stats. <BR> <BR>&#149; Tweaking the length of the second track &#40;and thus, the total burn time&#41; on a larger scale changed the main and sub breeds. <BR> <BR><FONT SIZE="+1">Epilogue:</FONT> <BR> <BR>Once again, this is all sheer hypothesis.  My sample sizes were quite small for scientific research.  I need to look at and tweak the subcode data itself to see where the numbers might come from, since my regular audio CD burning program is giving me malformed subcode. <BR> <BR>I welcome all comments, criticism, praise and questions, either through this message board or through e-mail.  I especially would be interested in data which contradicts my findings.  And kudos for reading the entire post. =&#93; <BR> <BR>- Quincunx

 bravo!  bravissimo!  well written - very lucid. <BR> <BR>btw, an anagram of torey luvullo is &#34;to lull voyeur&#34;.  there is no known sensible anagram for quincunx - more research needs to be done in that area!

Torey:  Thank you!  I hope it helps some researcher somehow.  Even if it&#39;s more &#34;in style&#34; to work with subcode &#40;which is where I&#39;m headed myself&#41;, this information could still be useful.  After all, subcode is basically just a represenation of the TOC, as is a list of actual track times. <BR> <BR>And I intended to find another anagram for your name, but the ones I came up with weren&#39;t flattering. &#171;grin&#187;  And while there aren&#39;t any good anagrams for &#34;quincunx,&#34; it <I>can</I> score you 311 points in Scrabble.  =&#93;
