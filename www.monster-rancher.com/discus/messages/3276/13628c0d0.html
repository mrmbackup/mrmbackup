 Well the first one makes a Worm&#92;Gali which was disappointing because I thought it was going to be a rare. But I do have 4 Playstations which have been know to read things differently so I will try it later in the others unless the Worm&#92;Gali is what it should&#39;ve been. The Sencond one is a Wracky&#92;Durahan. But I don&#39;t get why anyone would purposely burn a CD of a monster you can just combine to get. I guess you were right when you said waste 2 CD&#39;s on them. Oh well.

 btw, for the future, if you burn one CD and it doesnt work, then that probably means I... did something wrong... and the second &#40; or any other subcode file &#41; prob wouldnt work... so you would only have to waste 1 CD that way... I wonder what went wrong now... guess Ill have to look at it later... darn...

 Btw, since you said: <BR> <BR>&#34;But I do have 4 Playstations which have been know to read things differently so I will try it later in the others&#34; <BR> <BR>can you please test those 2 CDs in a Playstation &#34;known&#34; to produce accurate monsters then? I ask cause Im pretty sure I got the algorithm correctly and those 2 files should have given you rares... so before I &#34;go back to formula&#34; I would appreciate if you can test them in a reliable system then, if its not too much trouble :&#41; &#40; since you already got the 2 CDs made anyways... &#41; <BR> <BR>Oh and I guess regular HTML tags dont work here or something? the &#60;I&#62; tag isnt working... guess I should go to the formatting playground....

 Oh and thanks for testing the MR1 files! :&#41; <BR>Im just alittle disappointed in how these turned out tho... but maybe its like you said and they might still work... guess Ill wait to hear back....

 Hmm Yeah I tested them on my other playstations and still got Worm&#92;Gali from Subcode 1 and Wracky&#92;Durahan from Subcode 2. And I did have to waste 2 CDs because  technically these could be considered rares since you must do things to unlock them. And without knowing what they should be how would I know it was wrong? What were they supposed to be? I assume one should&#39;ve been Pole Mock since thats one everyone is still looking for. And yes I used them in the US version. I have 2 PSX and 2 PS2 and they all read the same.

 Ok, well I went home and I tested these by falsifying the CD read data, &#40; ie making the game believe I put in such and such CD &#41; and I got what I expected for both. Then I changed the required CD data for the monsters to match that of my Final Fantasy Tactics game and I once again got what I expected from it. <BR> <BR>Then I followed John Hawley&#39;s advice and lowered the write speed of CloneCD to 1X and was able to make one of these 2 CDs &#40; the first time I put the CD in it took a while to get it to read, but then it worked &#41; and I actually got what I expected I would from it... so bottom line is, so far, everything Ive done to re-test these have given me correct results. &#40; or I should say, what I expected to get &#41; <BR> <BR>The only thing I havent tried is to actually pull out the old PSX, plug it in with all the cables, put in the game, get to that point in the game and actually try the CD, which is a hassle Im trying to avoid... short of that, well, I dont know what to tell you... <BR> <BR>Since the monsters are rares, I got the &#34;you&#39;re not allowed to make these, blabla&#34; message, so I did go and changed some data to give myself those qualifications, but I really doubt that could have affected anything as to what monster you get... <BR> <BR>Something on your side is obviously different from my side... that is, either the game version is not the same for some reason, or the CD you made for some reason doesnt match the subcode data, etc. <BR> <BR>Maybe I&#39;ll just burn the other CD and mail it to Lisa so she can test them out...

 Lisa, is the address you have at the consent form current? I think Ill just mail you the CDs so you can try em out... see if its just me that has an issue to work out...

 Btw Scorpio Maurus, thank you for your efforts. I hope I didnt come across as though I was being nasty or anything... sometimes I say things without realizing others might mis-interpret my meaning... I m just confused as to why you got the monsters you did with those CDs... ?_?

 Ohhh... here&#39;s an idea... why dont you now use CloneCD to make the subcode files out of those CDs and post them. If cloneCD copied everything fine, the subcode file it makes out of those 2 CDs should be the same as the subcode you used to make them... that would be an interesting test... <BR>Oh and I did mess up in one of the files. For the  subcode file that has this for entry 2: <BR> <BR>&#91;Entry 2&#93; <BR>Session=1 <BR>Point=0xa2 <BR>ADR=0x01 <BR>Control=0x04 <BR>TrackNo=0 <BR>AMin=0 <BR>ASec=0 <BR>AFrame=0 <BR>ALBA=-150 <BR>Zero=0 <BR>PMin=61 <BR>PSec=4 <BR>PFrame=15 <BR>PLBA=178515  <BR> <BR>It should be: <BR> <BR>&#91;Entry 2&#93; <BR>Session=1 <BR>Point=0xa2 <BR>ADR=0x01 <BR>Control=0x04 <BR>TrackNo=0 <BR>AMin=0 <BR>ASec=0 <BR>AFrame=0 <BR>ALBA=-150 <BR>Zero=0 <BR>PMin=61 <BR>PSec=4 <BR>PFrame=15 <BR>PLBA=274665 <BR> <BR>The PLBA value I had forgotten to re-calculate it... sorry... in any case, even if that messed things up, the other CD should have worked...

 Hmm I just read a little of: <BR> <BR>Monster Rancher Metropolis: The Laboratory: Technical Research On The Monster Rancher CD Read Process: General Q &amp; A: CloneCD rejecting CD&#39;s ? <BR> <BR>And it seems like some people have ran into problems with certain CDs or subcodes not working for them in certain situations, etc... Could this be one of those issues? I wonder...
