 Okay, so Lisa&#39;s discovery with MF/R3 CDs got me thinking, and I realized that if Tecmo had really wanted CDs to be &#34;special&#34;--that is, a certain CD yields a relative monster--that they would have the foresight to know that different pressings would screw up that scheme. <BR> <BR>So why, why, WHY does it?  I thought about some of Enigma&#39;s research, and, after reading some pieces of info he overlooked, I decided to test it myself. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, because of current lack of resources, I could only do a 3-CD test.  Everyone is welcome to pursue this further. <BR> <BR>The basis of my research is the Birdie rarity, namely because it has only 1 track, and that track &#40;fortunately&#41; ends at Frame 7.  My theory is that the entire rare monster could be taken from a CD whose minutes and seconds match the given CD, but not necessarily the frames. <BR> <BR>Why?  Well, as we&#39;ve all noticed, a slight change of frames &#40;greater than 4--note this, Enigma, because from what I read, you overlooked this--and if I&#39;m mistaken, I apologize&#41; will give you a different monster.  In most cases, a small change will modify the subbreed.  In some cases, as with rares, it will give you something completely different &#40;and, please, no references to giant feet&#41;. <BR> <BR>This CD has the following stats: <BR>Length:  35:31:07 <BR>Track One:  Starts at 00:02:00 <BR> <BR>Result:  A Birdie &#40;Suezo/???&#41;. <BR> <BR>According to modern theory, a relative change of 4 tracks &#42;should&#42; keep the same monster.  This may or may not be the case, since the base frame may not be 7.  However, I assumed it was, since it would be a safe bet that the subtype would not change. <BR> <BR>CD-Test1 <BR>Length:  35:31:03 <BR>Track 1:  Starts at 00:02:00 <BR> <BR>Result:  Birdie &#40;Suezo/???&#41; <BR> <BR>Okay, this test yielded the expect result, although research of this nature &#40;from what I am familiar with, including my own research&#41; has not been extensive--rares may not be included in the 4-frame rule.  Anyhow, the Birdie was the same. <BR> <BR>Now to try something that, under normal circumstances, would yield a different subbreed, if not a totally different breed of monster:  I was going to set it well beyond 4 frames &#40;23, to be exact&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>CD-Test2 <BR>Length:  35:31:30 <BR>Track 1:  Starts at 00:02:00 <BR> <BR>Result:  Birdie &#40;Suezo/???&#41; <BR> <BR>Conclusive?  In my opinion, no.  But it definitely lends itself to my theory.  And, as I stated earlier, everyone is welcome to continue this research.   <BR> <BR>And, consider this:  what if, using my theory, Tecmo wanted, say, a CD of 55:55:xx to yield Monster X, and they used a sample CD for it.  It would have worked well...&#42;&#42;unless that CD&#39;s physical length was 55:55:73&#42;&#42;.  If there was another pressing, the next pressing &#42;might&#42; be 55:56:0x, and, thus, no longer be subject to the Fuzzy Frame rule.  A slight oversight, and a lost Rare. <BR> <BR>--Cats
