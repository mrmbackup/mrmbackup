 I downloaded the version of CloneCD from Legend cup and set everything up, but then when I click it something pops up where it says &#34;CloneCD is not free!&#34;. Then there are some issues of copyright laws, it expiring, etc. At the bottom it asks me if I want to &#34;Try it!&#34; or &#34;Register...&#34;. What do I do and how? If this is answered somewhere else please tell me. I could&#39;ve sworn someone said it was free and never expired...

 The instructions are pretty out of date. I did it this weekend tho. Just click the &#34;Try it&#34; whenever that box pops up.

 Thank you, that had me so freaked out. I would never want to do anything illegal or download something that costs cash&#40;yah, that&#39;s right, i&#39;m a cheap goody-good&#41;.

 Yeah, I was pretty flustered when I was trying it too. It looks like the version currently available is newer then the one they wrote the instructions for. All the icons and steps are totally different so I sure didn&#39;t expect it to work but, happily, it did.

 The instructions are written for: <BR>&#34;or you can go to legendcup.com and download version 2 which never expires.&#34; -as mentioned in step 1. <BR> <BR>If you have the version 2, do not select &#34;register it&#34; because you will then be stuck downloading a newer version. Just click &#34;try it&#34;.

Then the instructions have been changed very recently. The ones I used and printed were from last Friday and they had a link to a &#34;Not Found&#34; page for the trial version and step one read &#34;You must have Clone CD software, a 30 day trial of the latest version can be found HERE&#40;<A HREF="http://www.elby.de/CloneCD/english/download.htm" TARGET="_top">http://www.elby.de/CloneCD/english/download.htm</A>&#41; or you can go to legendcup.com and download version 2 which never expires.&#34;  <BR> <BR>It defenitely didn&#39;t state which version it should be used for and since the link was dead I just googled for it. I see I would have saved my self a lot of panic if I&#39;d just gone to legendcup tho, dangnabbit.

 Well, I&#39;ve run into another annoying problem...the files aren&#39;t in my c:/windows/temp, they&#39;re somewhere else where it says I can&#39;t open them because windows doesn&#39;t know what created them, and evidently, my Image.ccd file doesn&#39;t even exist. This would be easier if someone was in chat, then I wouldn&#39;t be wasting your space, Lisa. I am such an idiot when it comes to computers...

 You need to enable the hidden files somewhere. That exact thing happened to me. Do a search for a file name &#34;image&#34; and be sure to have it search hidden folders as well; that option is a little lower in the search window. <BR> <BR>And the computer will never know what program created the file; you have to tell it with the &#34;open program with&#34; selection then just choose Notepad.

 I am such an idiot that I failed to notice &#34;select notepad&#34;. Well, everything was different for me so I got a little funged up. And I speak of wasting space, terribly sorry. Thanks again Magic Pink.

 I have changed the link here at MRM to download the CloneCD version 2 straight from Legendcup.com this way you are using the same version many are using and the same version that the instructions were written for. <BR> <BR>Also, there should be instructions on both sites &#40;MRM &amp; LC&#41; as to how to enable viewing hidden files and folders so that you may find the image.ccd file <BR>:&#41;
