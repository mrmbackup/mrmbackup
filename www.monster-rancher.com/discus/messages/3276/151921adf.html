 Has anyone ever tried to/figured out how to play monster rancher using a playstation emulator?  I&#39;ve been trying to get a bunch of different emulators &#40;pSX 1.13, ePSXe, PSXeven&#41; to read the subcode data files but they generally always give jell subtype and correct main type, or correct subtype but dino main type.  I believe I had one of them working when actually reading off a cd it seemed to work, but then it&#39;s almost not even worth it to use the emulator. <BR> <BR>By the way, I&#39;m talking about the first Monster Rancher.  I don&#39;t own any of the others.

I was able to get it to work with Monster Rancher 2 &#40;you can give this a shot with MR1&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve spent the last few days trying to figure out how to get an emulator to read a CloneCD .ccd datafile without having to burn the CD onto a new CD-R, and I&#39;ve finally gotten it to work successfully with ePSXe &#40;I&#39;m using v1.6.0, though I&#39;m sure it works on other versions&#41;. <BR>The whole issue was trying to find a program that was willing to mount the modified .ccd file that had a mismatching .img file. <BR> <BR>!!Note: It is best if you have a digital copy of your game on your computer for this to work &#40;an .iso, .cue/bin, or other form&#41;.  The main reason is because ePSXe does not allow you to re-assign which CD drive it reads from in the middle of playing without exiting the program and reopening. <BR>A way around this might be using savestates for when you need to switch, but it may be a bit of a hassle.  You can create an image of your game using several types of software; I used Alcohol 120%. <BR> <BR>What you need to do is &#40;on Windows&#41;: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Download Virtual CloneDrive, which is a free program distributed by the same company that owns CloneCD. It&#39;s basically a &#34;virtual CD drive&#34; like Daemon and Nero: <BR>&#40;<A HREF="http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html</A>&#41; <BR> <BR>2&#41; Install Virtual CloneDrive.  It should appear in the tray by the computer clock.   <BR> <BR>3&#41; Right-click and make sure to remember what drive letter it is &#40;&#34;Drive &#91;?&#93;:&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>4&#41; Go to the drive&#39;s menu and click &#34;Mount...&#34;, and find and select the modified .ccd file that you created. <BR> <BR><U>To ePSXe:</U> <BR> <BR>5&#41; In ePSXe, click Config -&#62; Cdrom <BR> <BR>6&#41; Click on &#34;Configure&#34; for whichever plugin is used &#40;default will work&#41;. <BR> <BR>7&#41; Select the Cdrom letter that&#39;s the same as the letter used by Virtual CloneDrive &#40;from steps 3/4&#41;.  Leave all the other options unchecked. <BR> <BR>8&#41; Run Monster Rancher 1/2 on ePSXe, and go to the shrine. <BR> <BR>9&#41; When it asks to switch discs, press &#34;Esc&#34; and go to File -&#62; Change Disc -&#62; CDROM, and press &#34;OK&#34; <BR> <BR>10&#41; Let the game read the disc data, and then change discs back to the Monster Rancher CD.  &#34;Press X&#34;...and go!  You should be able to get the monster that the .ccd code is intended to give. <BR> <BR>I hope this&#39;ll be helpful, because I&#39;ve tried all sorts of weird things before I was able to get it to work.  I&#39;ve seen more Gaboos and Hachiro failures than I&#39;d ever want to see again. XP

 Hello, here is another method i used. <BR> <BR>I have ePSXe v1.6 and MR2 .img &#43; .ccd files. <BR> <BR>UltraISO: <BR>- Use UltraISO to convert MR2 img file into CloneCD as .img .ccd and .sub files <BR>- Rename the 3 files into another name &#40;e.g test.img, test.ccd, test.ccd&#41; <BR>- Make sure all 3 files are in the same directory <BR>- Modify test.ccd to any subcode you want <BR> <BR>DAEMON Tools Lite &#40;Get the latest version&#41;: <BR>- Left click on it from your task icon <BR>- Mount test.ccd &#40;from above&#41; <BR>- Remember the drive letter <BR> <BR>ePSXe v1.6: <BR>- Config -&#62; select &#34;CDR WNT/W2K core...&#34; <BR>- Click on &#34;configure&#34; <BR>- Select the Cdrom letter &#40;from above&#41;, all options below unchecked <BR> <BR>After all are done, proceed with the game: <BR> <BR>1&#41; File -&#62; Run ISO -&#62; MR2.img &#40;whatever your image name is&#41; <BR> <BR>2&#41; Go to the shrine and prepare to &#39;change disk&#39; <BR> <BR>3&#41; Press esc on the &#39;change disk&#39; part <BR> <BR>4&#41; File -&#62; Change Disk -&#62; Cdrom, click &#39;ok&#39; <BR> <BR>5&#41; Continue with the game <BR> <BR>6&#41; After &#39;disk&#39; being read, it will ask you to change back to MR2 <BR> <BR>7&#41; Press esc on the &#39;change disk&#39; part <BR> <BR>8&#41; File -&#62; Change Disk -&#62; ISO -&#62; MR2.img &#40;whatever your image name is&#41; <BR> <BR>9&#41; And here&#39;s the big moment! Thats all! <BR> <BR> <BR>You can modify test.ccd anytime you want and shrine it. Just re-mount it on DAEMON TOOLS. <BR> <BR>Just a lil&#39; help from me ^_^ <BR> <BR> <BR>Also, can&#39;t seems to mount some subcode. Can&#39;t seems to bypass/force mount it.
