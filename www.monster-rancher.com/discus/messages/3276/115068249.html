 Hey kiddies, <BR> <BR>  Long time no see.  Been busy.  Sorry.  I see that not a  <BR>lot has gone on with DVD research, so I&#39;ll lend a slight  <BR>hand.  Here&#39;s some 411 I&#39;ve got now, and hopefully  <BR>tonight I&#39;ll have some more: <BR>   <BR>  1&#41;  PS2&#39;s don&#39;t like DVD-RWs.  That&#39;s going to totally  <BR>crimp my style.  Especially when one considers: <BR> <BR>  2&#41;  Back in the day, I could burn several CDs.  that was  <BR>no problem.  Cd &#60; 20 cents.  No problem.  DVDs,  <BR>however, are more like $3 a pop.  Not exactly  <BR>something I can fiscially justify in burning several in a  <BR>row just for testing.  However, I&#39;ve got several movie  <BR>clips I want on DVD, so it should work out.   <BR>Unfortunately, <BR> <BR>  3&#41;  It takes a while to encode my movies to MPG-2  <BR>format.  Fortunately, it doesn&#39;t take as long as I thought,  <BR>but it can take days &#40;given my schedule&#41; to get a DVD  <BR>together. <BR> <BR>  4&#41;  Unlike in the day &#40;and as I&#39;m sure you guys can see  <BR>by my absence&#41;, I don&#39;t have as much free time as I  <BR>used to.  So I&#39;ll help where I can. <BR> <BR>  5&#41;  I confirmed a few nights ago that my original  <BR>accessment was right:  DVD movies are burnt on a  <BR>single track.  &#40;Don&#39;t confuse this with titles, which  <BR>subdivide a track--I&#39;ll explain in a future posting&#41; <BR> <BR>  6&#41;  Turtles are green. <BR> <BR>  7&#41;  When CSS/Macrovision/Region protections are  <BR>removed, burnt DVDs will produce a Psiroller under  <BR>MR3.  oh yeah, that too: <BR> <BR>  8&#41;  I don&#39;t have MR4 yet <BR> <BR>  9&#41;  back to 7&#41;:  So I&#39;m going to test with turning those  <BR>protections on.  My next DVD will just have CSS and  <BR>Region encoding &#40;since Macrovision is just per-video,  <BR>and probably doesn&#39;t affect the shrine process, physical  <BR>track time aside&#41; <BR> <BR>  Whew.  TTYL. <BR> <BR>--The Ever Immortal Cats

 oh, but i should note that I&#39;ve just had the optical replaced  <BR>by Sony;  it may be available on older models, but is isn&#39;t on  <BR>the newer ones. <BR> <BR>--Cats

 Darn it. <BR> <BR>  Okay, after spending probably an extra 10 hours on  <BR>burning this DVDs &#40;both extra work to enable CSS/Region  <BR>as well as unexpected problems&#41;, I finally got it burnt. <BR> <BR>  Unfortunately, I had overlooked one simple thing:  most  <BR>home DVD burners lack CSS encryption abilities.  &#40;CSS is  <BR>designed so that one can&#39;t just rip a DVD&#41;.  My SuperDrive is  <BR>among them.  So after all that work, the only protection I  <BR>had on it was region encoding &#40;of which I protected for  <BR>Region 1 &#40;North America&#41; and Region 8 &#40;Special&#41; &#40;didn&#39;t  <BR>know what it was for, so I left it in&#41;&#41;.  I didn&#39;t use  <BR>Macrovision, since that affects the actual playback of each  <BR>track &#40;read:  title&#41;, not the overall protection of the DVD.   <BR>&#40;It&#39;s designed so that you can&#39;t just dumb-dub a DVD onto,  <BR>say, VHS.  Instead, you get static or video distortion&#41;.  I may  <BR>come back to it and put Macrovision back in.  I don&#39;t know. <BR> <BR>  End result:  Psiroller.  Same as with the other movie DVDs I  <BR>have burnt.  I suspect, for movie DVDs, one needs to  <BR>actually include CSS protection onto the burnt DVDs.   <BR>Without the ability to this, however, this is only conjecture. <BR> <BR>  There is another possibility that there is another variable  <BR>&#40;such as actual media testing&#41; at play.  I&#39;ll see what else I  <BR>can dig up.  But the overall answer--even without the CSS  <BR>testing--is that DVD copying for creatures is not going to  <BR>be feasible for most people.  &#40;Further, copying actual DVD  <BR>movies that you do not own is, obviously, immoral, illegal,  <BR>and very fattening, and thus not something I can  <BR>recommend or endorse&#41;. <BR> <BR>  I did confirm, btw, that DVDs are indeed a single burnt  <BR>track.  &#40;And this is why I start using the term &#34;title&#34; above  <BR>and in chat, as to not confuse;  although, to be honest,  <BR>&#34;track&#34; is also correct for referring to the data burnt into the  <BR>single movie track&#41;. <BR> <BR>--Cats, who will continue this in the next message

 &#40;continued&#41; <BR> <BR>  I wanted to explain the makeup of a DVD, for those of you  <BR>who are not familiar with it. <BR> <BR>  A movie DVD is just like a data DVD.  It is.  It&#39;s in Joliet  <BR>format &#40;ISO 9660&#41; with at least two folders on it &#40;one  <BR>contains the audio, which, for me, is almost always empty &#40;I  <BR>don&#39;t use multi-language on my home movies&#41; and one that  <BR>is video &#40;TS_VIDEO&#41;, which contains all the video&#41;. <BR> <BR>  Unlike audio CDs, where different physical tracks make  <BR>sense, movie DVDs are on a single physical track.  The data  <BR>on that single track makes up the different content of the  <BR>DVD:  foreign languages, multi-angle, pictures/slideshows,  <BR>etc.  On an audio CD, it makes sense having separate  <BR>physical tracks--if you&#39;re listening to your CD in your car,  <BR>for example, you don&#39;t care about different languages,  <BR>cutscenes, different angles, etc--you just want to get to the  <BR>next &#34;chapter&#34; or cut in the audio CD.   <BR> <BR>  On a movie DVD, all those extras are combined  <BR>&#40;multiplexed&#41; into several files.  By doing this, you can have  <BR>the same video with different subtitling or audio &#40;language&#41;.   <BR>Further, they are combined to allow additional protection  <BR>&#40;to prevent others from just &#34;ripping&#34; the video&#41;. <BR> <BR>  This also means that, unlike audio CDs, where the number  <BR>of tracks affect what creature appeared during shrining,  <BR>movie DVDs have a different set of specifications to use.   <BR>Perhaps physical track length is still used &#40;mind you, you  <BR>can now use hours for track length;  before, you could only  <BR>use minutes:seconds:frames&#41;.   <BR> <BR>  But this also means, to use the TOC to create specific  <BR>creatures &#40;like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon for a Zan&#41;,  <BR>you would need to actually create the data to the exact  <BR>length, as well as possibly filling in much of the same info  <BR>&#40;number of tracks/titles&#41;--basically, something that is not  <BR>entirely that feasible for the average Joe. <BR> <BR>  So that&#39;s where I stand now.  If I get any brilliant ideas, I&#39;ll  <BR>let y&#39;all in.  If anyone has any ideas or questions, just post  <BR>it.  I&#39;ll be around.  8&#41; <BR> <BR>--Cats

 Update: <BR> <BR>I had rented MR4 a week ago &#40;or so&#41; and tested some of the  <BR>DVDs I had burnt.  Same issue.  &#40;I don&#39;t remember what  <BR>type of creature it produced, but it was better than the lame  <BR>PsiRoller&#41;. <BR> <BR>Long story short:  if you want rares based on DVDs, you&#39;re  <BR>gonna have to physically possess the DVD to shrine the  <BR>creature.   <BR> <BR>--Cats
