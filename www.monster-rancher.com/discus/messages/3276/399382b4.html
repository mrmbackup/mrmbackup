 CloneCD seems to take offense at &#34;Songs in the Key of X.&#34;  This is the CD that gives the Bajarl/??? Ultrajarl.  I&#39;ll post the exact error message, but before I do, anyone else run into this problem with this or any other CD?

 Yes, I don&#39;t own it, but in chat people have mentioned that particular CD by name as not working, I believe there may be one more /??? CD as well, but I do not recall the title.

Sometimes it simply seems not to work... <BR>example: <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t remember who, but someone posted a &#34;Skeleton&#34; which the subcode was in eror and produced a Niton/Kato &#40;which seems to ALWAYS happen after burning bad subcode data that makes the game freeze until you put the MR2 CD back in&#41; <BR> <BR>A friend also sent me several other subcodes, some worked some didn&#39;t.  a Mia and Kokkushi in this case.. If yours work, John, then either it is a bizarr rare error that just happens, or maybe some CDROMS just don&#39;t read certain CDs that well.. &#40;or the PC is sub standard etc.&#41; <BR> <BR>Basically.. I don&#39;t know why sometimes the same CD will work for 1 person and not another <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Monster Fenrick</FONT>

 Can&#39;t say if they work, MF. No burner. All I can do is post &#39;em and take &#39;em down if somebody says that they don&#39;t work. So long as CloneCD makes a code anyway.

 I just poted my Skeleton and Kokushi last night.  I did not try to burn them of course since I own the cd&#39;s but I will just to make a copy for the MRM.  We&#39;ll see if I run into problems. <BR> <BR>Perhaps I should try it out on my lone CD-RW so as not to waste 50 cents per CD-R... Hmmm... never mind. ;&#41;

 I think I know what the problem is with the &#39;Key Of X&#39; CD. There is a hidden track that is placed at the _beginning_ of the CD. You have to put the CD in, then _rewind_ it for approximately 10 minutes to hear the two hidden tracks. Just putting the CD into the machnie starts it _after_ those hidden tracks, therefore giving you a bit of space that doesn&#39;t need to be there. <BR> <BR>.... at least, that&#39;s my best guess on what the problem would be, with Key Of X.

 Hmm... That might be it.  CloneCD can get the track and other info off it through the drive info command, but fails both a data and music track read. <BR> <BR>On a side note, I was unable to burn a copy of the Chef &#40;Blink 182&#41; CD using a different IMG and SUB file.  I think it&#39;s due to the Blink 182 CDD info being a 2 seesion set and the small IMG I&#39;m using is a single session file.  This might also explain the problems encountered with the Skeleton CDD info which again, is two session.  I have both cd&#39;s so I&#39;ll check that theory now and report back.

 Well the mystery deepens.  As I suspected, trying to burn a copy of the &#34;Skeleton&#34; &#40;Marilyn Manson&#39;s Mechanical Animals&#41; using the two session CDD file with a single session IMG and SUB file didn&#39;t work.  CloneCD gave me a &#34;CDD does not match the IMG file&#34; error.  To my surprise, the same error occured when I replaced the single session IMG and SUB files with two session files from the Blink 182 disc.  I guess I&#39;ll try editing the CDD file to wipe out traces of a second session, and see if that works.  I suspect though that if it indeed is able to burn the CD, I won&#39;t get a Skeleton.

 Well how about that &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;! It worked!  I went into the CDD for MM-MA, erased the entry for Session 2, changed tracks 19-22 from Session=2 to Session=1, put my small single session IMG and SUB files in the TEMP directory with the modified CDD file, burned the CD, shrined it in MR2, and got a Skeleton &#40;Henger/???&#41;.  How about that! <BR> <BR>This seems to imply that MR2 doesn&#39;t care or read the second session info, but does read tracks that call the second session data in the IMG file.  Fascinating!  I&#39;ll post my modified CDD for the Skeleton and check out the Chef next.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have any problems though.

 But the same treatment for the Blink 182 CDD did not yeild a Chef.  Instead I got a Mock/Mock.  I&#39;m confused again.  A little help here?

 In case your wondering, the Skeleton from the burned CD is identical to the Skeleton from the original MM-MA CD.  Same stats, bad nature, and Arm Cannon attack.

 Well I couldn&#39;t just wait for some help could I?  I had to find a way to do it myself before I signed off for the night.  And I did!  By taking the CDD modification one step further, I was able to burn a cd that produced a Chef in MR2 with a completely unrealted IMG and SUB file.  In addition to the steps I took above, I also removed the last four track entries in the the CDD file and changed the TOC field from 21 to 17.  Again, this is fascinating.  MR2 was detecting tracks on a completly differnet subchannel in a completley different session on the CD and produceing a Mock/Mock.  But when the tracks were removed and the TOC reduced to 17 tracks, voila! A chef was generated. <BR> <BR>Although I&#39;m happy I was able to circumvent the problem on multiple session cd&#39;s two different ways, I&#39;m less confident about ever figuring out how MR2 is using this information.

Hey Farmer Jimbo.  I provided the First &#34;Chef&#34; as Subcode.. and I didn&#39;t have any problems doing it. <BR>I did this on the disc that I made another CD from.. and the Chef and the previous monster both yeilded the same Music... <BR>This is what gave me the idea of changing the subcode while keeping a small .IMG file which takes only seconds to burn the CD. &#40;since it obviously didn&#39;t matter what the actual data was after accidentally finding that out&#41; <BR> <BR>I am not sure about the Multi Session CDs, but, for the record, the friend that e-mailed me the &#34;Bad&#34; subcode for the Skeleton only yielded 4 tracks. Also, my &#34;Image.IMG and .SUB&#34; Files are from a CD that I just burned a text file onto, and then just change the &#34;CCD&#34; file to the monster that I want and it&#39;s always worked on my end.  it DOES give you the error/promt that the IMG and CCD files do not match with a couple of choices to write until end of image, or chance CCD to match image file etc. but I always tell it to keep the &#34;CCD&#34; and it works just fine. <BR> <BR>Let me know if there&#39;s any experiments you&#39;ld like to try or ideas i&#39;ll try &amp; help out with that. <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Monster Fenrick</FONT>

 I&#39;m talking about a fatal error from CloneCD.  Try burning a &#34;Skeleton&#34; from the un-modified CDD I posted.  It should give you a CloneCD Caution error that says: &#34;IMAGE.img does not match to C:&#92;WINDOWS&#92;TEMP&#92;IMAGE.CDD&#34;  It does not let me burn a CD after that error.  Only after I modified the CDD in Wordpad to get rid of Session2 entries does it stop giving me this error. <BR> <BR>The &#34;Specify Lead Out&#34; Window always comes up for me before I burn the CD.  I click &#34;OK&#34; for the &#34;Keep TOC same as on source CD. Write until end of img file.&#34;

 Not that I&#39;m aware of.  I&#39;m using 150mb IMG off a Miller Lite promotional &#34;mini-CD&#34;.  I had a &#34;Duh-hickey&#34; moment when yout mentioned writing your own super-mini cd with a text file, but have yet to burn any new one&#39;s since that time.  If you have the inclination, try the Chef or Worm/Worm modified CDD&#39;s I&#39;ve posted.  I&#39;ll try burning a Skeleton cd using a &#34;super-mini&#34; IMG from a text file now and see if I get a fake penguin as well.

 Burning then using a &#34;super-mini&#34; IMG file had mixed results.  I was able to make a super-small IMG just fine, but the resulting burned CD&#39;s caused MR2 to ghork when I tried to shrine them.  I needed a few more coasters I guess.  Basically the Lilim I tried to burn with a 2mb IMG failed, but when I switched back to my 150mb IMG, it worked fine. <BR> <BR>Just for clarification Fenrick, have you been able to burn a Chef or Skeleton using un-modified CDD data and unrelated IMG and SUB files?  I was not able to until the above shenanigins.  If you want to have another go at the Skeleton, I&#39;ll post a different CDD that might work better than the one I&#39;ve already posted.  If the Chef doesn&#39;t work though with the modified CDD and un-related IMG data, I&#39;m back to square one I guess.

Another Idea:  Maybe for those CDs with Multi Sessions, I should just try making an image of a CD that I have with Multi Sessions.. then, Maybe that&#39;ll be enough to trick Clone CD into thinking the image.IMG file is the same as the CCD file for those &#34;special&#34; subcode files such as the Skeleton. <BR>Or maybe not...? <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Monster Fenrick</FONT>

Farmer Jimbo - I tried the CCD data that I put on here for the Chef.. and it did not work, I got the error as with the Skeleton. <BR> <BR>The &#34;Modified&#34; Chef data DOES work though.  Have you tried burning the Skeleton data to see if you got a Fake Penguin? <BR> <BR>Also, I tried making the image of the multi session CD &#40;From Blink 182&#41; and then trying to copy the skeleton Data but it was still unsuccessful &#40;CCD does not match the IMG file error&#41; <BR><FONT COLOR="0000ff">Monster Fenrick</FONT>

 I tried matching up a multi-session IMG to a multi-session CDD, but got the same fatal error as before.  Apparently CloneCD is a little stricter when it comes to matching multi-session CDD&#39;s than single seesions.  I couldn&#39;t make it work, which is why I tried editing the CDD down to one. <BR> <BR>The difference between the CDD for the skeleton and Chef is this:  The Skelton CDD has the same TocEntries field as the origonal, but the last four entries were changed from Session=2 to Session=1.  Also, the Session2 settings block was erased and number of sessions was changed to one.  The Chef CDD takes it one step further by deleting the last four entries and reduceing the TocEntries field by four. <BR> <BR>I did use the modified CDD I posted for the Skeleton to burn a new CD and it did produce a Skeleton and not a Fake Penguin.  Furthermore, the Skeleton it produced is identical in every respect to the Skeleton I get from the origonal Marilyn Manson CD.  I&#39;ll put a second modified CDD for the Skeleton up in the same thread as the first modified CDD.  This will be the same &#34;Chef&#34; treatment&#34; CDD &#40;meaning I&#39;ll erase the Session2 entries and back the TocEntries field down by four.  If you&#39;re willing to risk makeing one more coaster, give a whirl and see what you get.
