 Only doing this with MR1 right now. Im examining what MR1 reads off cd and puts into memory. <BR> <BR>So far i can state for certain that in variables that actually change in memory  <BR>1.Total Track number comes first <BR>2. 1st set- Pframe Psec and PMin <BR>3. 2nd set- that tends to be same as the ones in 2 <BR>4. 3rd set- same order different numbers <BR>5. Unknown variable that i call the OG number..Og is different from cd to cd but its the same thruout the cd <BR>6. Og number <BR>7. Misc area. Groups of variables?&#40;maybe a dynamic equation of some sort?&#41; that vary a lot from cd read but stay same with same cd. <BR>8.race it will be <BR>9.subrace it will be <BR>10.variable that seems to mimic the subrace&#40;maybe its for breeding&#41; <BR>11. Totally Unknown Variable&#40;not even a guess&#41; <BR>12. Og number <BR>13. Possible variable that might determine the starting stat baseline&#40;i will check this soon using gameshark&#41; <BR>14. Unknown&#40;maybe related to &#34;behavior&#34;&#41; <BR>15. Unknown but same as 16 <BR>16. Unknown but same as 15   <BR> <BR>any thoughts?

 13 does not effect any of the visible starting stats&#40;didnt check attacks though&#41;...but strangely enough after you leave the creation area it becomes identical to life.

 changing the race or subrace before the monster is formed does change the stats of the critter. Havent tested to make sure the hidden stats are the same as they are supposed to be when doing so..still looking for some of the hidden stats.

 Findings of the info ive found: <BR> <BR>The shrine program converts a lot of variables&#40;subcode etc etc&#41; to just a handful. <BR> <BR>Ive found no evidence of a need for a table to make the rares ordinarly from cds&#40;could be wrong i admit, just saying i found no evidence&#41;. <BR> <BR>The most bytes truly changed by the shrine in MR was 67 bytes and quite a few of those were results of whatever the equation is and not the read off information of the cd&#40;although theres some of that too&#41;. <BR> <BR> So far the max stat gain that ive found is a gain of 316 from base. This is off the stat variable that i just found.&#40;need to verify other things dont vary it&#41; <BR> <BR>Higher the variable the higher possible change&#40;good and bad&#41;. I found more than a few that lowered life to 1 lol. <BR> Straight Base seems to be very common thruout for the effects. <BR>sidenote: <BR>I do also want to mention i believe the lab DOES have one or more tables extra to determine stat changes.

 the highest &#34;upgrade&#34; of 316 seems fatally flawed whereas the more moderate one of 231 seems perfect...im going to research what the 316 doesnt have. <BR> <BR>Its flaw makes it unable to complete ANY job or training successfully. <BR> <BR>The 316 one would be good a money monster who stays on lowest level. The fact it cant gain stats from jobs or training would encourage its use as such&#40;or maybe for that then breeding only if safe&#41;
