 I downloaded CloneCD today. I followed the directions exactly and attempted to create a CD containing Deathwing &#40;Phoenix/???&#41; When I popped the CD into my PS2, it resulted in a Pandora&#39;s Disc. The Disc obviously contained the Antlan Rangers, which is not what I wanted. Just a guess, but I suspect that there may be something wrong with the posted Deathwing subcode. Hopefully this can be double checked.

 Sounds like either a problem with your PS2, or some sort of error in placing and re-placing the MR4 disc in your system. If you get the Antlan Rangers after seeing the Pandora disc storyline, then the game is reading itself. There is absolutely no way to make a copy of a DVD, like the MR4 game, or to burn a CD to even be similar to a DVD&#39;s subcode setup. Your PS2 is reading your MR4 game instead of the burned disc. <BR> <BR>By the way, the reason the Deathwing TOC file is modified is because the unmodified TOC data did not work. Once John worked on it and fixed it, not only was it tested repeatedly, hundreds of people have used it without problems since. I have personally chatted with many, many people who have used the data sucessfully to make Deathwing, in the MRM chatroom.

 Slight correction &#40;albiet the gist of the message is correct&#41;: <BR> <BR>&#34;There is absolutely no way to make a copy of a DVD, like the  <BR>MR4 game,&#34; <BR> <BR>That is, at the literal read, false.  One can certainly duplicate  <BR>DVDs.  The question is:  what kind if DVDs?  Just like the PSX,  <BR>the PS2 game DVDs are designed with copy-protection built in  <BR>to prohibit piracy.  &#40;I just confirmed this now&#41;.  Yes, it will make  <BR>a DVD, and the data will be preserved.  That extra chunk of data  <BR>&#40;or lack thereof--depends on your POV&#41; will not copy over.   <BR>That, however, does not affect the TOC. <BR> <BR>&#40;And, btw, a duplicated MR4 will shrine as a Mushatan&#41; <BR> <BR>On the other hand, you are perfectly within your right &#40;and, thus,  <BR>within your abilities&#41; to duplicate DVDs that you had created:   <BR>audio DVDs, MP3 DVDs, data DVDs, or even movie DVDs. <BR> <BR>Commerical DVDs:  simply put, you should not copy them.   <BR>Period.  &#40;Even those that you own&#41;.  So I will not even go into  <BR>detail there.  For all intents and purposes, they cannot be  <BR>duplicated. <BR> <BR>&#34;or to burn a CD to even be similar to a DVD&#39;s subcode setup.&#34; <BR> <BR>...geez...to me, that sounds like a challenge.  I might take you  <BR>up on that.  I&#39;ve got about 7 days of free time...  8&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;Btw, technically, one should be able to do the reverse:  set up a  <BR>DVD&#39;s TOC to match one of a CD.  The reverse...would be  <BR>interesting&#41;

 addendum to the above: <BR> <BR>-Also to be clear, said MP3 DVDs, data DVDs, and movie DVDs  <BR>that you create will not shrine well.  The data DVDs will create  <BR>Mushatans, and movie DVDs will create either a PsiRoller or  <BR>...something else.  &#40;I forget&#41;.  I&#39;m going to try an audio DVD  <BR>today, however, <BR> <BR>-As far as the DVD TOC to a CD:  granted, with the knowledge of  <BR>CSS encoding affecting the shrining, the result, if I was able to  <BR>mimic the TOC, would still be off.  Probably.  &#40;My guess is that  <BR>the CSS key is one of the subcodes in the TOC, and is not a valid  <BR>subcode on CD TOCs.  &#40;See know why I&#39;m so insisting on  <BR>labeling this correctly?  TOC--Table of Contents--contains many  <BR>subcodes--such as the s, q, and p--which is evident in the  <BR>CloneCD files.  If I didn&#39;t, this would become even more  <BR>confusion than it is already!&#41;&#41;

 audio DVDs:  ACK!  I could have SWORN it was possible.  In  <BR>theory, it is.  But, according to both iTunes and Toast, CDROM- <BR>XA and Audio tracks cannot be written to DVDs. <BR> <BR>well, live and let learn!
