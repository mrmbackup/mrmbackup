 I&#39;ve been planning on doing some hard-core subcode research, and now that I&#39;ve got a long weekend, I can sit down and get busy.  But I&#39;ve noticed that there are a lot of flags and/or tags in the subcode data other than PMin, PSec, PFrame and PLBA.  Here&#39;s a snippet of subcode. <BR> <BR>&#91;Entry 5&#93;  <BR>Session=1  <BR>Point=0x03  <BR>ADR=0x01  <BR>Control=0x00  <BR>TrackNo=0  <BR>AMin=0  <BR>ASec=0  <BR>AFrame=0  <BR>ALBA=-150  <BR>Zero=0  <BR>PMin=8  <BR>PSec=20  <BR>PFrame=2  <BR>PLBA=37352 <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just wondering what these stand for.   <BR> <BR>As for Session, I&#39;ll probably work with single-session CDs anyway. <BR>Point seems to match up with the number of the track from Entry 3 forward. <BR>ADR - no clue on this one <BR>Control - no clue <BR>TrackNo - no clue; this isn&#39;t track number, since it&#39;s always at 0 for the audio CD I&#39;m looking at <BR>AMin, ASec, AFrame, ALBA - no clue; might be lead time for the track &#40;when your CD player counts down in negative seconds at the beginning of a track&#41;? <BR>Zero - um... no clue <BR> <BR>&#91;And, yes, I know some of the numbers are in hexadecimal, and PLBA = &#40;PMin x 60 &#43; Psec&#41; x 75 - 150.&#93; <BR> <BR>If anyone has some insight on what these tags/flags stand for, could you please share it?  And are they important?  Should I just leave them alone?

 If you had asked me about a year ago, Quin, I  <BR>could have told you in detail, along with points  <BR>and references in the all-coveted Red Book. <BR> <BR>Now, however, I have only vague ideas. <BR> <BR>Most of those flags &#42;are&#42; the subcode.  You  <BR>see, calling this information &#42;subcode&#42; really  <BR>isn&#39;t correct.  I&#39;ve kept my mouth shut, tho,  <BR>because Lisa used it as her term, and it was  <BR>used widely out here.  If you note my previous  <BR>posts, I refer to it as the Table Of Contents,  <BR>&#39;cause that&#39;s what this really is. <BR> <BR>Anyway, the A-code are like lead-in  <BR>information.  And they differ, depending on  <BR>what kind of information is presented.  Dittos  <BR>with the P-code.  Those are the most two  <BR>relevant pieces of information, and if you really  <BR>want to know what they are, do two things: <BR> <BR>1&#41;  Refer to my research.  That is how I  <BR>hand-burn CDs. <BR> <BR>2&#41;  Burn a CCD.  Print out its information.   <BR>Then take a close look at your CD via PSX,  <BR>your PC, whatever.  You&#39;ll notice that each  <BR>track starts at each p-code spot.  &#40;or is it  <BR>a-code?  I don&#39;t have a CCD handy to refer to&#41;.   <BR> <BR>Btw, thank you for reminding me what LBA  <BR>was.  I couldn&#39;t remember that for the longest  <BR>time...and I never bothered to just ADD UP  <BR>THE VALUES.  Yes, and now you say it, I used  <BR>it quite frequently for burning &#40;it&#39;s easier to use  <BR>that value than mulitplying myself--plus, it&#39;s  <BR>good for error-correction&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, if you want any of my lectures, catch  <BR>me at a good time in the chat, and I can  <BR>muddle the specifics with ya. <BR> <BR>--Cats, first to burn a cd, given only subcode  <BR>information, and who worked on CD-burning  <BR>software, hence his involvment in the  <BR>monster-pulling experiments.

 Btw, to clarify the subcode vs. TOC  <BR>terminology:  first off, Sony/Whoever decided to  <BR>leave 26&#43; tables of information for future  <BR>reference.  They only used something like 7,  <BR>two of the most common being A and P.   <BR>&#40;Look familiar&#41;?  And, even then, the only  <BR>relevant info in &#42;them&#42; was the times &#40;since  <BR>you need to know the start time and the track  <BR>length;  which, ironically, from what&#39;s been  <BR>posted, the length has been omitted&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, a better analogy is a Apple tree.  What  <BR>is being done here is that we&#39;re calling the  <BR>whole tree an Apple.  It&#39;s not.  It&#39;s a &#42;TREE&#42;.  It  <BR>holds Apples.   <BR> <BR>But I&#39;ve avoided this as much as possible,  <BR>simple so researchers here wouldn&#39;t get  <BR>confused. <BR> <BR>--Cats, original researcher.

 Cats:  Just found a post of yours I&#39;d missed before somehow, and it makes things a bit clearer. <BR> <BR>Sorry about propagating the use of the word &#34;subcode&#34; to refer to the ToC. <BR> <BR>Since the research I&#39;m doing at the moment doesn&#39;t involve looking for rares, I feel safe starting with a CCD file from a regular audio CD and not touching any of the &#34;mystery&#34; parts. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your response.

 Sure.  However, like i said earlier, feel free to  <BR>use the term &#34;subcode.&#34;  I may not like it, it  <BR>may not be technically correct, but I have the  <BR>feeling that enough people have a hard  <BR>enough time with the actual burning and  <BR>understanding of the technicals that they don&#39;t  <BR>need to be burdened by a change in the  <BR>lexicon. <BR> <BR>In other words, since &#34;subcode&#34; has been so  <BR>thoroughly used so far, let&#39;s just keep using it.   <BR>Consider it slang.  Whatever. <BR> <BR>And, yes, I kinda wish I had CloneCD at my  <BR>disposal;  it would make research a hell of a  <BR>lot easier.  &#40;Instead, I&#39;ve gotta adjust x tracks  <BR>by a very minute amount;  it&#39;s far easier to  <BR>change a value in the p-code table.   <BR>Everything, then, would lay out correctly, or at it  <BR>might.&#41; <BR> <BR>--Cats

If you&#39;re still looking for information on this, here is the web address of a site that addresses the &#34;what is subcode&#34; question: <BR><A HREF="http://www.ee.washington.edu/conselec/CE/reports/Group.1/matt_page_individual/subcode.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.ee.washington.edu/conselec/CE/reports/Group.1/matt_page_individual/subcode.html</A> <BR> <BR>I think I found this site either off of the forums here or somewhere similar, so this may be old news to you, but here it is again.

 So wait a minute it still doesn&#39;t explain it to me completely, is the PMins and PSecs the length of the song? and if those are, then what are the AMins and ASecs?That link didn&#39;t really help me any.

 &#34;the A-code are like lead-in information. And they differ, depending on what kind of information is presented. Dittos with the P-code. Those are the most two relevant pieces of information&#34; <BR> <BR>They vary by what is on the CD, and they tell the player where each track begins and ends on a disc and how much space is between them. In other words, they mark out the in-between spaces.
