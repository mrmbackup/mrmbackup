As an example of researching CD subcode data, I thought I&#39;d present this example.I have two copies of the Ramones CD, Mondo Bizarro.

To further enlighten you, I have also posted the subcode data for each CD, as separate subtopics on this page. Take a look and compare.

 this is interesting, lisa.  thanx for the info.   <BR> <BR>on the one hand, the total time and tracks are very similar for the 2 cds.  however, once it is broken down as you did, the two cds have a significant number of differences.  starting with entry 2, the 2 cds are different in psec, pframe and plba.  one would think that pframe and plba is only different where psec &#91;length of a given track, i am assuming&#93; is different, but in entry 3 &#91;looks like a silent space between two tracks&#93;, psec is identical, but pframe and plba are different. <BR> <BR>i am assuming that the average listener would not be able to differentiate between the 2 cds.  it looks like the difference between the two is that on one, some tracks are a second or two longer, and some are a second or two shorter.  when broken down to component parts, however, the two are quite different. <BR> <BR>so i&#39;m guessing that different games focus on different fields for different attributes of the monster.  i am also remembering that things like monster type and stat number can be the same - like cds with different track length, and component attributes can nonetheless give you the same monster, or the same starting life, etc. <BR> <BR>makes it quite a complex puzzle.  again, thanx for the info.

Thanks for the analysis! Yes, these 2 CDs are indistinguishable to the listener, that was partly why I chose them as an example. I wanted to find a pair of CDs that were as much alike as possible, in order to figure out where the game looks for differences. &#40;For example, in creating stats.&#41; <BR> <BR> Hope this added a bit of insight into just how difficult it is to figure out what exactly the game looks for, and why I can&#39;t just tell people what data to use to burn their own! <BR> <BR>-And a note to the superstitious, both of these CDs have the exact same title, cover art, and art on the CD itself. So, once again, the title of a CD has nothing to do with what monster it makes!

I slated the MR1 monsters over to MR2, and made an interesting discovery: the stats were very different than for monsters made from the CD in the shrine &#40;possibly because there&#39;s a different main breed&#41;, and the composite is higher! Both monsters were frozen straight from shrine, no raising, no items. <BR> <BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Title</TD><TD>Lif</TD><TD>Pow</TD><TD>Int</TD><TD>Ski</TD><TD>Spd</TD><TD>Def</TD><TD>Slated total</TD><TD>MR2 shrine total </TD></TR><TR><TD>Mondo Bizarro</TD><TD>135</TD><TD>142</TD><TD>78</TD><TD>163</TD><TD>99</TD><TD>122</TD><TD>739</TD><TD>724 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Mondo Bizarro<FONT SIZE="-2">Columbia House</FONT></TD><TD>129</TD><TD>155</TD><TD>126</TD><TD>143</TD><TD>92</TD><TD>113</TD><TD>758</TD><TD>743</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

 oh!  lisa, you edited the main message - i didnt see that mr1 tech list table there before...dont think im hallucinating.^_^  that adds one more variable to the already variable-rich mess. <BR> <BR>btw, as the result of a chat last night, i am searching my cd collection for any cd that makes the exact same monster in both mr1 and mr2.  they are quite rare - ive searched about 100 and only found two that make the same main/different sub.  if anyone is curious, or thinks they can help, please feel free to join in.

 Yes, thought it made a neater presentation. I&#39;m doing some slating experiments now. One thought about this, and the whole slating mystery &#40;why some raised monsters slate higher than others&#41;, might be that they slate better if their stats are in line with their starting ratio just like your combo info. Since straight off a CD is about as close to perfect a ratio as you can get, they slate relatively well. Remember, in the MR1 days we knew nothing about this stuff and raised unbalanced monsters.

 that is the point of a thread with carl carlisle and richard ryley over at tecmo awhile back - that the combining theory &#91;that good combos come from monsters whose stats are similar and comparable to their baseline ratios&#93; might be equally applicable to slating, as you express in your message.  if the boxes and the attic cooperate with me this weekend, i may have some time to do some of those slating things we talked about in chat the other night. <BR> <BR>carl has done a lot of looking into slating - paging carl carlisle, please!

 Wow! Thanks! This is still a very small sample, but we&#39;re at 100% on it; slated monsters &#40;unraised, no items&#41; have higher stats than their shrined MR2 counterparts from the same CD.

 well, so far the tentative conclusion is also very small...you get a slight stat advantage when slating monsters with the same main type in both mr1 and mr2, instead of shrining them in mr2, so long as you dont care what subtype you end up with.  remember, some of the stat advantage may be due to the differeing subtype in my two cd sample &#91;although not with the ramones&#93;.

 Great job! as i said in my original post, I don&#39;t own a CD burner, so i was stuck simply looking at a pile of Cds and the data I could extract from them. You&#39;re the first person to actually get inspired to do something about it.
