I just made a major discovery regarding how the MR2 Shrine generates statistics for monsters from CDs.  There&#39;s a <I>lot</I> more work I need to do, but I&#39;ll post some initial findings as a bit of a &#34;teaser&#34; and to raise the spirits of everyone who&#39;s been doing research. <BR> <BR>My new hypothesis:  The MR2 shrine uses a table of 60 sets of six numbers to generate statistics.  The set of numbers corresponding with PSec2 is added to baseline stats for the main and sub breeds to generate the stat numbers. <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>PMin1</TD><TD>PMin2</TD><TD>PSec2</TD><TD>Main/Sub</TD><TD>Lif</TD><TD>Pow</TD><TD>Int</TD><TD>Ski</TD><TD>Spd</TD><TD>Pow </TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>Gaboo/Gaboo</TD><TD>185</TD><TD>136</TD><TD>38</TD><TD>67</TD><TD>173</TD><TD>73 </TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>Gaboo/Gaboo</TD><TD>206</TD><TD>147</TD><TD>31</TD><TD>45</TD><TD>176</TD><TD>86 </TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>Gaboo/Gaboo</TD><TD>190</TD><TD>142</TD><TD>49</TD><TD>58</TD><TD>182</TD><TD>69 </TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>4</TD><TD>Gaboo/Gaboo</TD><TD>205</TD><TD>126</TD><TD>50</TD><TD>48</TD><TD>160</TD><TD>84 </TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>Tiger/Zuum</TD><TD>75</TD><TD>106</TD><TD>128</TD><TD>187</TD><TD>163</TD><TD>103 </TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>Tiger/Zuum</TD><TD>96</TD><TD>117</TD><TD>121</TD><TD>165</TD><TD>166</TD><TD>116 </TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>Tiger/Zuum</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>112</TD><TD>139</TD><TD>178</TD><TD>172</TD><TD>99 </TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>4</TD><TD>Tiger/Zuum</TD><TD>95</TD><TD>96</TD><TD>140</TD><TD>168</TD><TD>150</TD><TD>114</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>In each case, the Tiger/Zuum&#39;s stats equal the corresponding Gaboo/Gaboo&#39;s stats -110, -30, &#43;90, &#43;120, -10 and &#43;30 respectively. <BR> <BR>The baseline for Gaboo &#40;the one you can get at the Market&#41; is 190/120/30/40/150/70.  If the baseline for Datonare is 80/90/120/160/140/100, this would strongly support my findings. <BR> <BR>The 60x6 table would look something like this: <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>PSec2</TD><TD>&#43;Lif</TD><TD>&#43;Pow</TD><TD>&#43;Int</TD><TD>&#43;Ski</TD><TD>&#43;Spd</TD><TD>&#43;Def </TD></TR><TR><TD>0</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>16</TD><TD>18</TD><TD>24</TD><TD>26</TD><TD>4 </TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>-5</TD><TD>16</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>27</TD><TD>23</TD><TD>3 </TD></TR><TR><TD>2</TD><TD>16</TD><TD>27</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>5</TD><TD>26</TD><TD>16 </TD></TR><TR><TD>3</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>22</TD><TD>19</TD><TD>18</TD><TD>32</TD><TD>-1 </TD></TR><TR><TD>4</TD><TD>15</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>20</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>14</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>...and so on. <BR> <BR>OK, I&#39;m getting excited. «smile»

I&#39;m going to need some sedatives. «grin» <BR> <BR>Just figured I&#39;d mix a baseline Tiger and a baseline Zuum to see if the resulting Datonare would have the stats mentioned above. <BR> <BR>I got the Zuum from the market.  Its stats are 130/120/80/140/100/110. <BR> <BR>No Tigers in the market.  I checked my CD collection.  Ping!  Negativland&#39;s &#34;Escape From Noise&#34; makes a pure Tiger.  Its stats are 88/115/142/191/150/57. <BR> <BR>I Shrined two of these Tigers and combined them.  The resulting Tiger&#39;s stats:  81/93/131/164/141/70. <BR> <BR>I then Shrined two more of the Tigers and combined them.  The resulting Tiger&#39;s stats:  again, 81/93/131/164/141/70. <BR> <BR>I then combined the two new Tigers.  The third-generation Tiger&#39;s stats:  80/90/130/160/140/70. <BR> <BR>Since these are all multiples of 10, it looks like this is the baseline for Tiger. <BR> <BR>I then combined the baseline Tiger with the market Zuum.  The result:  a Datonare &#40;Tiger/Zuum&#41;.  Its stats:  80/90/120/160/140/100. <BR> <BR>This matches my prediction from the previous post! <BR> <BR>Conclusions: <BR>&#149; Combining two pairs of a pure monster from CD, then combining the resulting monsters, appears to yield a baseline version of that monster. <BR>&#149; In my previous post, I&#39;m definitely on to something. <BR> <BR>Now here&#39;s a mystery. <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Breed</TD><TD>Lif</TD><TD>Pow</TD><TD>Int</TD><TD>Ski</TD><TD>Spd</TD><TD>Def </TD></TR><TR><TD>Baseline Tiger</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>90</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>160</TD><TD>140</TD><TD>100 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Baseline Zuum</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>120</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>140</TD><TD>100</TD><TD>110 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Baseline Datonare</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>90</TD><TD>120</TD><TD>160</TD><TD>140</TD><TD>100</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>The only stat difference between basline Tiger and baseline Datonare is Int.  Since Zuum&#39;s Int is 50 less than Tiger&#39;s Int, Datonare&#39;s Int is 10 less than Tiger, its Main. <BR> <BR>A guess here:  The baseline stat for a mixed breed is the baseline stat for its main breed, minus 10 for every full 50 points lower the baseline stat for the sub breed is than the main breed. <BR> <BR>Nope, no luck there.  Look at Crab Saurian &#40;Arrow Head/Zuum&#41;. <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD>Breed</TD><TD>Lif</TD><TD>Pow</TD><TD>Int</TD><TD>Ski</TD><TD>Spd</TD><TD>Def </TD></TR><TR><TD>Baseline Zuum</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>120</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>140</TD><TD>100</TD><TD>110  </TD></TR><TR><TD>Baseline Arrow Head</TD><TD>120</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>70</TD><TD>30</TD><TD>40</TD><TD>170 </TD></TR><TR><TD>Baseline Crab Saurian</TD><TD>130</TD><TD>120</TD><TD>80</TD><TD>150</TD><TD>110</TD><TD>140</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>The pattern held for the first three stats, but the last three don&#39;t follow at all. <BR> <BR>Oh, well... can&#39;t expect to crack all the game&#39;s secrets in one morning.  «shrug»

 Btw, from which table is &#34;PSec2&#34;?  Which track is this referring from--the total time of the CD, or the first track?  Are you referring to control A2? <BR> <BR>--Cats

I just compared this table to Enigma&#39;s Mum Mew family in the thread <I>Modifying subcode to affect stats and monster type in Monster Rancher 2</I>, and the numbers match up. <BR> <BR>The only odd thing is that when I reverse the calculation, it gives me baseline stats for a Mum Mew of 103/68/87/132/144/107.  Of course, this is for a 12-track disc, not a 1-track disc like I was using. <BR> <BR>So the stat formula appears to be something like S<SUB>N</SUB>=B<SUB>N</SUB>&#43;M<SUB>N</SUB>&#43;T&#40;PSec2,N&#41;, where N is &#91;1 for Lif, 2 for Pow... 6 for Def&#93;, S<SUB>N</SUB> is the value the Shrine generates for the Nth stat, B<SUB>N</SUB> is the baseline stat value, M<SUB>N</SUB> is some other modifier that I haven&#39;t worked out yet, and T&#40;PSec2,N&#41; is the entry on the above table corresponding to the PSec2 value and the stat.

 Cats:  By PSec2, I&#39;m referring to the PSec value from Entry 2, which would be the total time of the CD.  It&#39;s also the length of the first track on the CDs I burned, because they were one-track CDs.  But the numbers under Entry 3 are not particularly interesting:  PMin=0, PSec=2, Frame=0, PLBA=0.  They just tell where the first track starts, not its length. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by control A2.  The entry with Point=0xa2 is Entry 2, the one I&#39;m using the PSec from, but the Control value for that entry is 0x00, as it is for all entries on these CDs.

 Short answer:  Okay, I got it.  I kinda figured you were using total time &#40;by $A2 control, I&#39;m referring to subcode table $A2, which &#42;is&#42; the total length of the CD&#41;--since you stated you were using a 1-track only CD.  But I wanted to make sure I &#40;and anyone else reading&#41; was absolutely clear on the postings. <BR> <BR>Something else I&#39;m thinking...what if the monster type itself is independent of the values &#42;on&#42; the CD &#40;aside from hard-coded rares&#41;?  What if the M:S:Fs all yield differing stats, and then those stats determine the creature--ie, instead of saying: <BR> <BR>MM:SS:FF will yield a Suezo.  Now use the seconds to determine its stats... <BR> <BR>It does this: <BR> <BR>MM:SS:FF makes the following stats:  xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.  Now which monster and subbreed match closely with it? <BR> <BR>I admit, it&#39;s a bit of a longshot, but certainly worth considering.   <BR> <BR>Btw, you may also want to look at the thread I just posted about &#34;updated&#34; research--I have some burnt Gaboos there, too, along with times and stats. <BR> <BR>--Cats

 Thanks for the clarification on $A2.  There are three levels on which we can talk about the makeup of a CD:  &#40;1&#41; the actual subcode &#40;using the term technically correctly here&#41;, &#40;2&#41; the table of contents based on PMin, PSec, PFrame, PLBA, etc., and &#40;3&#41; the lengths of the tracks in minutes and seconds and frames.  Since they&#39;re all being used by various people, things get misunderstood sometimes. <BR> <BR>And as for your latest thought, it&#39;s not the most elegant solution programmingwise, but it is possible.  Looks like more research and less sleep for me. «grin»

So why not Baku/Zuum, Ghost/Zuum, Niton/Zuum and Kato/Zuum?  Because there are no such monsters in the game. <BR> <BR>And why Zuum/Baku and not Zuum/Zuum?  I&#39;m not sure.  One possibility is that there&#39;s a table in the Shrine program that has a special sub &#34;breed&#34; which is Pure; that is to say, if the sub is Pure, it makes the pure-breed form of the main breed.  If the sub is the same as the main, on the other hand, the Shrine may change the sub to a different type. <BR> <BR>All this is sheer hypothesis, of course.  I have so much more research to do, and I can&#39;t stay awake any longer today, so it will have to wait for tomorrow.

 Cats:  I&#39;ve still got hundreds of blank CD-Rs, so resources aren&#39;t an issue for me  And I thank you for the kind and generous offer of assistance, but for the time being, since I&#39;m still in the exploration stage, I&#39;m not really able to say, &#34;OK, Cats, could you check this range from X to Y?&#34;... generally because I&#39;m working very methodically in large bursts. <BR> <BR>And time is not a factor for me.  Since I have few obligations in life, I have &#34;all the time in the world&#34; to work on this project.  Also, I&#39;ve got the perfect set-up ergonomicswise for doing this kind of work, and it only takes a hair over a minute for me to go from one disc to the next, since I burn disc 073 as I&#39;m shrining disc 072. <BR> <BR>The problems with collaboration on this outweigh the work it would save me if someone were to help out.  I&#39;d be more helped by insights and observations on my posts than I would by other people burning CD-Rs for me outside of my &#34;controlled environment.&#34; <BR> <BR>Thanks for the offer, though! «beaming smile»

As for the sine wave, does anyone know if PS hardware can do trig on the fly?  Or would that be a cumbersome software task?  I&#39;d guess that any machine that can render a 3D environment and trace a trajectory can calculate a sine. <BR> <BR>Regardless, I honestly don&#39;t think it&#39;s that complex, especially after discovering that the random factors in stat generation apparently come from a number table, not a formula.

 Well, it&#39;s probably a lut--this is my thought process, and pretty useful, considering how much code I wrote to do 3d animations myself &#40;ie &#34;before&#34; OpenGL&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re doing a one-time trig function, it doesn&#39;t matter.  The fpu &#40;which, i think i can safely assume, is a part of the ps processor&#41; handles it.  It&#39;s slow if you do it 100x over the timespan of a second, but doing it 6 times every minute or so...well...no one really notices it. <BR> <BR>So, then, when I had to get around that, how did I handle it?  A lut &#40;LookUp Table&#41;.  Basically, if i had an angle &#40;or, usually, an angle between 5 or 6 degrees, to minimize memory/space&#41;, the function would use an optimized switch statement and return the value instantly.  &#40;Or something very similar to those lines--i don&#39;t remember if i did a quick-array-check--it a static array, and i instantly calculated the offset within the array...but this is neither here nor there...&#41; <BR> <BR>  Point is:  I tend to agree it&#39;s a lut.  The values may have been generated previously, but it&#39;s still possible that a very simple trig equation was used, as well.  Whatever. <BR> <BR>  Anyway, my offer still stands.  It should like you&#39;ve got a far better setup than I;  the only thing I should try to &#34;one up you&#34; is see if VPC will accept MR2 on my G4.  On my iBook, it would run &#40;SLOWLY&#41;, but it wouldn&#39;t allow me to shrine critters.  &#40;That way, i don&#39;t even have to move in the least--burn, run VPC, shrine, burn, etc...but it sounds like you&#39;ve got me beat there anywho&#41;. <BR> <BR>  Anyhow, just let me know if you want a series of CDs to analyze.  I may just do some anyway, who knows.  Blah. <BR> <BR>--Cats

Here&#39;s a way to actually use this PSec2 data and CloneCD to do something useful:  tweak the stats of a monster on one CD to create another CD with stats more aligned to your preferences. <BR> <BR>This won&#39;t make a Pixie with 220 Pow or a Golem with 210 Int.  But if you have a CD that makes a monster you like but you&#39;d like to, say, boost its Lif and Def a few points at the expense of a few points of Int, here&#39;s how. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">NOTE:</FONT> This will <FONT COLOR="ff0000">NOT</FONT> work with rares!  Tweaking the ToC data from a rare will likely give you a random common monster. <BR> <BR><FONT COLOR="ff0000">NOTE:</FONT> This method will <FONT COLOR="ff0000">NOT</FONT> give your monster 999s or even 500s for stat values.  At best, you will get a gain of as much as 30 in one stat, and no more than 50 in the composite. <BR> <BR>1&#41;  First, you must have the Table of Contents data &#40;popularly called &#34;subcode&#34;&#41; for the monster you wish to modify.  Either use CloneCD to make the Image.ccd file from a CD you have, or use subcode data listed on this site. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Using the table below, look at which stat&#40;s&#41; you want to increase and find the corresponding number. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Under Entry 2 in the Table of Contents data in Image.ccd, replace the number in the line that says <FONT COLOR="0000ff">PSec=</FONT> with the number you found in step 2. <BR> <BR>3a&#41; Recalculate the PLBA for Entry 2.  PLBA = &#40;PMin &#42; 60 &#43; PSec&#41; &#42; 75 &#43; PFrame -150.  Update the value in the Image.ccd file. <BR> <BR>4&#41; Now burn the CD as you normally would. <BR> <BR>Again, it&#39;s only a small gain, but it has the potential to help your monster succeed, especially at a young age. <BR> <BR><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD><B>Stat&#40;s&#41; to increase...</B></TD><TD><B>Use this PSec value</B> </TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Lif</TD><TD>14 &#40;high Int&#44; low Pow and Def&#41; or<br>47 &#40;high Ski and Int&#44; low Pow&#44; Spd and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Pow</TD><TD>19 &#40;low Lif and Ski&#41; or<br>49 &#40;high Int&#44; low Lif&#44;Ski and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Int</TD><TD>9 &#40;high Def&#44; low Lif and Ski&#41; or<br>49 &#40;high Pow&#44; low Lif&#44;Ski and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Ski</TD><TD>25 &#40;high Lif and Spd&#44; low Pow&#44; Int and Def&#41; or<br>33 &#40;high Int&#44; low Pow&#44; Spd and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Spd</TD><TD>7 &#40;high Lif&#44; low Pow&#44; Int and Def&#41; or<br>18 &#40;low Pow and Int&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Def</TD><TD>30 &#40;high Int and Ski&#44; low Lif&#44; Pow and Spd&#41; or<br>48 &#40;high Lif&#44; low Int&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Lif&#43;Pow</TD><TD>58 &#40;low Ski and Spd&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Lif&#43;Int</TD><TD>12 &#40;high Ski&#44;low Spd and Def&#41; or<br>14 &#40;low Pow and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Lif&#43;Ski</TD><TD>25 &#40;high Spd&#44; low Pow&#44; Int and Def&#41; or<br>55 &#40;high Int&#44; low Pow&#44; Spd and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Lif&#43;Spd</TD><TD>38 &#40;high Def&#44; low Pow&#44; Int and Ski&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Lif&#43;Def</TD><TD>48 &#40;low Int&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Pow&#43;Int</TD><TD>49 &#40;low Lif&#44; Ski and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Pow&#43;Ski</TD><TD>54 &#40;high Spd&#44; low Lif&#44; Int and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Pow&#43;Spd</TD><TD>45 &#40;high Lif and Ski&#44; low Int and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Pow&#43;Def</TD><TD>2 &#40;high Lif and Spd&#44; low Int and Ski&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Int&#43;Ski</TD><TD>33 &#40;low Pow&#44; Spd and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Int&#43;Spd</TD><TD>3 &#40;high Pow&#44; low Lif and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Int&#43;Def</TD><TD>30 &#40;high Ski&#44; low Lif&#44; Pow and Spd&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Ski&#43;Spd</TD><TD>54 &#40;high Pow&#44; low Lif&#44; Int and Def&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD>Ski&#43;Def</TD><TD>57 &#40;high Spd&#44; low Lif&#44; Pow and Int&#41; </TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>Spd&#43;Def</TD><TD>57 &#40;high Ski&#44; low Lif&#44; Pow and Int</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR> <BR>Note:  Only entries giving the maximum possible values of the desired stat&#40;s&#41; have been listed.

 I know there&#39;s still one other factor that affects stats besides the PSec2 table and base stats for the breed.  It&#39;s a set of constants, one for each stat, that is added in, and comes from somewhere like number of tracks or ToC data for Entry 4 or later.  It&#39;s why, say, all pure Galis with PSec2 of 8 don&#39;t have the same stats. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve run into a small obstacle in my research, as I&#39;ve burned over 60 more CDs looking for a loop in monster breed from modifying PMin2 and haven&#39;t found one.  Coincidentally, I also didn&#39;t find a Worm or a Dragon in the series.  But I&#39;m still going, a little at a time.

 Don&#39;t know if this helps, but going through the CD lists I&#39;ve noticed that almost all the records for Dragon and Worm are on audio CDs. There&#39;s a total of 8 or 9 games that produce Dragon or Worm.

John:  Actually, I have only run PMin2=1 to PMin2=65 so far; I won&#39;t have truly finished the cycle until I get to PMin2=80, which is the theoretical maximum for a CD.  There&#39;s also the possibility that Worm and Dragon are not findable in the simple search I am doing &#40;one-track audio CDs with PSec2=0&#41; and must come from multi-track CDs.  I hope to get to this by Wednesday morning. <BR> <BR>Danz:  What you&#39;re suggesting seems unlikely to be possible.  In all my observations, the list of techs seems not to come from the Table of Contents data, but directly from the monster breed.  The one exception I&#39;ve seen to this is a CD exists which makes a pure Worm that gets Roll Assault, but this disc may be considered a rare. <BR><FONT SIZE="-1">&#91;For more info:  The Laboratory &#62; Subcode Data Files &#62; Monster Rancher 2 Subcode &#62; CD Subcode Data Archive /???
