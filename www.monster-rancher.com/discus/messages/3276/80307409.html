 Wanted to let y&#39;all know that I&#39;ve been  <BR>analyzing a series of saved game files, and I  <BR>believe that I&#39;ve I&#39;ve located the area where  <BR>fatigue is saved in Monster Rancher 3. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, due to redundant checks in  <BR>saved files, I cannot modify this value &#40;at least  <BR>not yet&#41;.   <BR> <BR>If anyone wants to help out with this research,  <BR>please feel free to add to this conversation!  I  <BR>hope to post onto my iDisk my saved files,  <BR>what differs between them, etc. etc.   <BR> <BR>My goal is to put together a formal research  <BR>and presentation so my investigation can be  <BR>double-verified by others &#40;such as the  <BR>scientific approach we took with CD  <BR>experiments and analysis&#41;.  I hope to unlock  <BR>how food and items affect creatures, and  <BR>perhaps glimpse into the inner working of this  <BR>wonderous game. <BR> <BR>And my apologies, Doc Shock, if I&#39;ve posted  <BR>this message in the wrong area.  ;&#41; <BR> <BR>--Cats

wtg cats!  any information you can unearth is greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>the current hotbed of mr3 &#34;looking into the game&#34; research is at monster-rancher.com, in the mr3 advanced section, in the form of posts and conversations between the campster and richard ryley.   <BR> <BR>any thread started by one of the above two has relevance, but here is a sampler that will let you know the current state-of-the-art: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://pub70.ezboard.com/fmonsterrancher4520frm32.showMessage?topicID=115.topic" TARGET="_blank">&#34;campster!&#34;</A> <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://pub70.ezboard.com/fmonsterrancher4520frm32.showMessage?topicID=118.topic" TARGET="_blank">&#34;stress research&#34;</A>

 Hey, thanks torey.  I read up on that, and it&#39;s  <BR>interesting, but, well.... <BR> <BR>...well, let&#39;s just say I plan on sharing my  <BR>findings, and will encourage others to  <BR>participate.  But, having said that, I will want  <BR>some control over the release of this  <BR>information.  Lisa and I have talked about this  <BR>already.   <BR> <BR>I&#39;m posting again this morning &#40;morning...ha!   <BR>I work the night shift!!  It&#39;s almost noon!&#41;  to  <BR>also let y&#39;all know that I think I found the offset  <BR>for how many weeks a critter has life for.   <BR> <BR>Based on my numbers, and given I&#39;ve got  <BR>items that retard stress and fatigue, and I&#39;ve  <BR>only been studying a single creature to this  <BR>point, and they&#39;ve all been in the same  <BR>location &#40;except my most recent tests, which  <BR>helped locate the f/s/life values&#41; my findings  <BR>come close to RR&#39;s.  The &#34;heavy&#34; drills  <BR>increase fatigue almost by 20, and light from  <BR>14 to 16.  &#40;I haven&#39;t focused on the stress yet,  <BR>so they don&#39;t really come to mind, but it&#39;s in the  <BR>neighborhood of 4 to 8 for heavy--again,  <BR>realize I&#39;m using items that also retard stress  <BR>and fatigue&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;Heavy includes the SandSwim, which I didn&#39;t  <BR>think would affect fatigue as much as the  <BR>&#34;heavier&#34; drills, such as the Balance, etc.  But  <BR>it appears that it does&#41;. <BR> <BR>Hopefully, I can get some more research done  <BR>when I get home tonight, as well as posting  <BR>some of my saves and insights. <BR> <BR>--Cats

 I wanted to apologize to you guys &#39;cause it&#39;s  <BR>been so long;  I made the mistake of NOT  <BR>realizing what day it was.  &#40;Friday, working in  <BR>retail:  let&#39;s just say that today would have  <BR>been my closest bit of &#34;free-time&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>I will post those files, along with a detailed  <BR>reasoning.   <BR> <BR>Anyway, thank you all for your patience. <BR> <BR>--Cats

 Okay, it&#39;s not quite what I promised.   <BR>Unfortunately, last night, as I was analyzing  <BR>the files in-depth, I realized some of my  <BR>suspected offsets may not have been correct.   <BR>So I need to continue analyzing more saves-- <BR>luckily, Tigger &#40;test subject&#41; is currently at the  <BR>last weeks of life, so that will give me an  <BR>excellent glimpse into lifespan. <BR> <BR>My current hypothesis is this:  The offset for  <BR>fatigue &#40;1 byte&#41; is at $841B, stress &#40;1 byte&#41; at  <BR>$841C, and lifespan &#40;1 byte&#41; is at $EE16.   <BR>There are other suspected values, and this is  <BR>a very early hypothesis.  &#40;Lifespan, I suspect,  <BR>is per each stage--baby, adolescent, adult,  <BR>elder--and lifespan works within each stage&#41;. <BR> <BR>Once I capture Tigger&#39;s most recent saves,  <BR>expect a post explaining and defending my  <BR>hypotheses. <BR> <BR>The saves are currently stored on my iDisk.   <BR>You can access them by going to http:// <BR>homepage.mac.com/grantguenther/. <BR> <BR>Btw, &#42;everyone&#42; is encouraged to participate.   <BR>This is very demanding work, and getting the  <BR>saves is the most difficult for me, simply  <BR>because I must be at home to do analysis  <BR>&#40;which, for those who don&#39;t know, I&#39;m rarely at  <BR>home--long hours, long commute&#41;.  I ask the  <BR>following, if you would like to be a part of this  <BR>research: <BR> <BR>1&#41;  Please state the week the save is in, along  <BR>with which location and activity was  <BR>performed.  &#40;In other words, we want an &#42; <BR>exact&#42; snapshot of the creature as it was  <BR>saved&#41;. <BR> <BR>2&#41;  Please limit yourself to one and only one  <BR>activity per save--ie don&#39;t take an item, eat,  <BR>whatever, and then do a drill.  Or don&#39;t submit  <BR>one save, and then perform 3 drills as the  <BR>second. <BR> <BR>3&#41;  Please submit at least 2 saves--a control  <BR>and a test. <BR> <BR>If you would like to be a part of this research,  <BR>please drop me an email with the saves  <BR>&#40;please be kind--I&#39;ve got a dialup at home&#41;  <BR>along with detailed information on each save,  <BR>and I&#39;ll get them posted for others to analyze. <BR> <BR>And, if it isn&#39;t clear already, everyone is  <BR>welcome to analyze these files for yourself  <BR>and submit your own theories.  I do warn you,  <BR>however--do not attempt to upload these to  <BR>your SharkPort.  They are specially-modified  <BR>for data comparison, and will not be seen  <BR>correctly by the SharkPort. <BR> <BR>Thanks, and happy hunting!! <BR> <BR>--Cats, original CD researcher

 Heheheh...I just realized that, without a  <BR>&#34;packing list&#34;, these files won&#39;t mean much to  <BR>you.  So here they are: <BR> <BR> <BR>Desert-Control.dat:   Tigger, week 2, in the  <BR>Desert region.  Used as a control for next set  <BR>of saves. <BR> <BR>Desert-Heavy Drill.dat:  Performed a heavy  <BR>drill--Balance, Rock Push, etc.  Unfortunately,  <BR>unable to capture exact drill.  Week 3. <BR>Desert-Heavy Drill2.dat:  Performed a heavy  <BR>drill--Balance, Rock Push, etc.  Unfortunately,  <BR>unable to capture exact drill.  Week 3. <BR>Desert-Heavy Drill3.dat:  Performed a heavy  <BR>drill--Balance, Rock Push, etc.  Unfortunately,  <BR>unable to capture exact drill.  Week 3. <BR> <BR>Desert-SuperDrill1.dat:  Performed a &#34;super&#34;  <BR>drill--Tornado or Real Thing.  Unfortunately,  <BR>unable to capture exact drill.  Week 3. <BR>Desert-SuperDrill2.dat:   Performed a &#34;super&#34;  <BR>drill--Tornado or Real Thing.  Unfortunately,  <BR>unable to capture exact drill.  Week 3. <BR> <BR>Morx-1LightDrill.dat:  Went to the forest and  <BR>did a light drill &#40;Probably a Block&#41;.  Week 3. <BR>Morx-2LightDrills.dat:    Did another light drill  <BR>in the forest &#40;Probably a Block&#41;.  Week 4. <BR>Morx-2Drills1Heavy.dat:   After the two light  <BR>drills, did a heavy drill &#40;probably Light Learn&#41;.   <BR>Week 1. next month. <BR> <BR>Morx-RestAfterDrills.dat:   After 3 drills in the  <BR>forest, rested.  Week 2, next month. <BR> <BR>Sorry about not knowing the exact drill--it got  <BR>lost in the shuffle.  However, because of the  <BR>important of the &#42;type&#42; of drill, that was what  <BR>was noted. <BR> <BR>--Cats
