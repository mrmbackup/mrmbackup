I have been corresponding via email with Eggie, and he has taken a look at the MR1 shrine. In doing so he has discovered that there is a CD out tehre someplace that makes a Pure Doodle. He has created subcode for it, check the purebreed subcode section, but we don&#39;t have a disc that makes it. He suspected &#39;Vampire on Titus&#39; by Guided by Voices, but, that turns out to make a Dino/Worm. <BR> <BR>Here are the basics of his discovery: <BR> <BR><I>&#34;If the minutes:seconds of total play time and seconds of first track match any of those 48 monsters, you get that monster. If it doesnt match any of them, you get an &#34;algorithm&#34; monster. Algorithm monsters only allow a main type and a sub type from 0 to 11 &#40;representing Dino for 0 all the way to 11 for plant&#41; meaning that any ??? sub breed and any of the other 8 main breeds are only available through the hard-coded CDs. These are: <BR> <BR>42 of the 43 ??? monsters &#40;the scribble is the only one not available&#41; <BR>1 duplicate for Santa &#40;this is why those 2 christmas CDs give you one&#41; <BR>1 Doodle &#40;the one I told you about&#41; <BR>4 common ones, 019 - Dean, 050 - Angel, 153 - Naga, <BR>081 - Kelp. They dont seem to have any spectacular <BR>stats or anything so I have no idea why they&#39;re hard coded... oh well... <BR>Monster.......Lif...Pow...Def...Ski...Spd...Int <BR>019 - Dean  - 070 - 071 - 074 - 187 - 147 - 095 <BR>050 - Angel - 060 - 060 - 140 - 190 - 184 - 190 <BR>153 - Naga  - 111 - 163 - 131 - 152 - 116 - 042 <BR>081 - Kelp  - 156 - 101 - 137 - 132 - 103 - 150 <BR> <BR>Thats pretty much it. So other than the Doodle, Im pretty sure you wont find any other monster since it was a hard-coded one. <BR> <BR>Also, for Two Tone, it was posted: <BR> <BR>&#34;Also found on &#40;we don&#39;t know why&#41;: <BR>Compton&#39;s Interactive Encyclopedia, 1996 Edition&#34; <BR> <BR>The requirements for Two Tone are that the total play time be 67:46 and only 1 track in the CD. So Im pretty sure that means that the Encyclopedia CD has a &#34;play-time&#34; of 67:46 &#40;and since its a data CD it has only 1 track&#41; and thats why that CD also gives you a Two Tone.&#34;</I> <BR> <BR>So, it looks like there indeed was a glitch in terms of not making a pure Disk monster available off CD, Scribble is not available on CD at all, and the other locked breeds have only the rares avaialable off CD. Somewhere there is a CD out there that makes a pure Doodle. Maybe one day we will find it. Until then, enjoy the subcode!

 Ah I remember this... I guess no one ever found the CD... its too bad... I wonder if the developers would know what CD they at least meant to give you the Doodle &#40; which, as was discussed previously, was probably a mistake... but nevertheless... &#41;
