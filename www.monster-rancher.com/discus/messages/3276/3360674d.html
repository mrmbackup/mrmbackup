<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
The following refers to CloneCD version 2. <BR> <BR>Ok, I seem to have to keep explaining this over, and over, and over, and over, and over again - at least twice a day every day in the chat since I did it. So, once and for all, here is what I did, and why, to post PSX CDs &amp; PC CDs. <BR> <BR>1&#41; If I tried useing a PSX with option #1 checked &#40;read subchannel data from data tracks&#41; I got an error message. That message said, &#34; SAMSUNG CD-ROM SC-140 is not compatible with CloneCD Read Mode &#39;Read Subchannel Data From Data Tracks&#39;&#34; with a little &#34;ok&#34; box under the message. The CD was not spinning during the time the message was still on the screen. If I click &#34;ok&#34;, the CD pops out of my machine immediately. If I put it back in, the same message would pop up, starting the same series of events. I got to be really fast at popping it in and clicking, but no matter how many times Fenrick told me that the software was actually scanning the CD despite the error message, IT NEVER DID. <BR> <BR>2&#41; I tried option #2 &#40;Read Subchannel data from music tracks&#41; and the software read my copy of MR1.  <BR> <BR>3&#41; I emailed the data to Fenrick, who got a Sueki from it. <BR> <BR>4&#41;All PSX or PC data I posted were done by selecting &#34;Read Subchannel Data From Music Tracks.&#34; <BR> <BR>5&#41; I do NOT have a CD burner. <BR> <BR>6&#41;Everyone who says they don&#39;t have the problem I had &#40;and who keeps insisting it&#39;s not a problem, that I&#39;m just doing something wrong&#41; is using a CD burner to read CDs. <BR> <BR>7&#41;So far, several people have been successful in making the correct monsters from my posts. <BR> <BR>8&#41; I think there are differences in the way varying machines are able to read certain types of CD.
