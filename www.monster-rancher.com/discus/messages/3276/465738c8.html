<!-NOTE: Message edited by 'admin'-!>
<B>Can&#39;t I just copy an entire CD, or copy all the songs from MP3&#39;s, and have it work?</B> <BR>No, chances are your copy will be a few frames off the original, and will make a different monster. This is why commercial CDs often make different monsters, even though the music on the CD is exactly the same. Each pressing can vary just enough to change the info needed to make monsters. Copying CDs was one of the first things people tried in 1997, it usually doesn&#39;t work. <BR> <BR><B>Can you guys make any monster you want with any stats you want?</B> <BR>Not yet. A CD can be burned and copy a monster from an existing CD. We don&#39;t have enough research yet to produce stats at will. But we are working on it. <BR> <BR><B>Can you make a CD with a MR2 wild monster on it, one of the errantry opponents, a tourney opponent, or Gentlemocchi?</B> <BR>No. These monsters were never designed into the charts the game uses to produce monsters from CDs. <BR> <BR><B>What do I need to make the monsters you have listed?</B> <BR>You need a computer, a CD burner, time to load a program or two, patience, and blank CD-Rs. <BR> <BR><B>How does it work?</B> <BR>Essentially, you burn a CD -but as you burn it you change the Table of Contents &#40;TOC file&#41; to be the same as a CD that makes the monster you want. This tricks the game into thinking the real CD has been placed in the shrine. <BR> <BR><B>Is CloneCD freeware?</B> <BR>Yes, although it has been withdrawn from the market, you can also download an older CloneCD &#40;version 2&#41; at legendcup.com -version 2 never expires, just do not ever choose to upgrade it. <BR> <BR><B>Why do some files posted here say version 2, and others say version3?</B> <BR>There were several versions of CloneCD released. The version number in the subcode TOC file reflects the version the person who posted the code was using. &#40;version 3 was popular for a while, but isn&#39;t available any more&#41; Change the version number to match the version of the software you hapen to be using.  <BR> <BR><B>Can I used CD-RWs, and save money?</B> <BR>Probably not. &#40;Only one person ever reported having success with their PSX being able to read CD-RW discs, and he has disappeared.&#41; Before investing in it, try using a CD-RW with any sort of data on it in the shrine. Some models of PSX won&#39;t even spin with a CD-RW in the drive. They don&#39;t work in MR3, either. Newer PS2 models will accept a CD-RW, however, there is no way to control what monster will be made, and every time you change what is on the disc, the monster will change as well. <BR> <BR><B>Can I burn a DVD to make a DVD rare?</B> <BR>Nope, even though there is a CloneDVD program, the nature of DVDs &#40;having one long data-stream track&#41; means that it&#39;s not possible to trick the burner into making whatever you want. <BR> <BR><B>Can I make rares that only come from PS2 games with CloneCD?</B>  <BR>No, the software won&#39;t read any PS2 games, either blue-bottomed, or DVD format. <BR> <BR><B>Can I make a monster with all stats at 999?</B> <BR>No, you can only make CDs that have stats possible in the formula that the game uses to generate CDs in the shrine. The game does not appear to have settings for monsters with stats at all 999s. <BR> <BR><B>Why do some blank CDs make nothing if I try to shrine them, and others make monsters?</B> <BR>Some CDs are truly blank, and won&#39;t make anything until you burn them. Others are pre-formatted, and have a bit of code already on the disc -these will make monsters straight from the package. <BR> <BR><B>Why do so many discs make Mocchis in MR3 and Mushtans in MR4?</B> <BR>These monsters were programmed to be produced any time the game or PS2 cannot read a disc. The only thing that discs that make them have in common is that they are considered non-system discs by the game. <BR> <BR><B>I am playing the PAL version, for the UK/AU/NZ, why don&#39;t your codes work for me?</B> <BR>Each game has the shrine program re-worked for each region, so that local CDs can make rares for you, plus other minor adjustments to correct inequalities discovered in other regions. Essentially, you need to visit a site that has PAL subcode posted on it. We do not currently know of any such site. <BR> <BR><B>Aren&#39;t you guys violating copyright law?</B> <BR>Nope. This process does not involve copying any of the actual copyrighted materials on a CD. Just the hidden table of contents of the CD, which shows where each song begins and ends. We encourage people to use short &#40;2-3 seconds in length&#41; clips of white noise while making discs with our process because shorter clips save lots of time, and there are no copyright issues involved.
