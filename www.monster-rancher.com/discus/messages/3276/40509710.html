 1st hypothesis: Monster is determined by the last PLBA#. <BR> <BR>The first thing I noticed while comparing some Subcode files for Dragons was that the PLBA#s were all in the same range. <BR>Tiamat = 168905 <BR>Gidras = 178582 <BR> <BR>The PLBA# on my Beck CD is 180268. I changed this # to 179268, just to see what it would do. I&#39;ll be back when the CD finishes, and I try it in my game. :&#41;

 Same Mum Mew. Same stats. One more try for tonight. Then I&#39;m going to bed. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to make the number 2000, and see if it has any effect whatsoever. If not, then the last PLBA# will be ruled out entirely for what type of monster you get. BRB

 I thought that somewhere, I have no idea where it&#39;s posted &#40;here, at Josie&#39;s or at his homepage&#41; that Catsgodot thought it had something to do with track one. I may be remembering this incorrectly, but it&#39;s probably worth a look-see.

 Well, I plan on trying many things. I got a pack of 100 CDs for $30, so I can afford to waste a few. I kinda wanted to start fresh, and make sure I had everything straight in my head. :&#41; Also, I looked through many of CatsGodot&#39;s threads, and don&#39;t remember seeing that one. At one point people thought it was the UPC, so who knows how many things are wrong in those early theories. I think CatsGodot had to retract a few statements. One in particular had him saying that the Subcode info has nothing to do with it. Ooops! hehe I&#39;m going to do something extreme tomorrow. not just changing numbers. ;&#41; &#40;and as you see, I still haven&#39;t made it to bed&#41; HA!

 Good points! Get some rest, we look forward to the results of more experiments! -Even if you don&#39;t get the result you want, keep records of everything, it will help everyone out in the future! <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, two rumors about the Beck CD are: there was a &#34;clean&#34; version that makes the rare, or, there was a version with a hidden track. I personally bought a &#34;clean&#34; version originally intended as an in-store demo, and it did not make Moo.&#41;

 Maybe Moo is located on the BMG version? I think someone over at MRCDDB may have it. Just waiting to hear back. Also, was MR1 Magnet on the &#39;other&#39; Beck CD, also? Because mine doesn&#39;t make Magnet either. Man, that&#39;s one &#34;gotta find&#34; CD! lol

 We have never found anyone who owned the &#34;right&#34; CD for either Moo or Magnet, so I really have no idea. I suspect that one pressing makes both monsters, like the Nirvana CD, and the Chipmunks.

 The Man, aka HTML, aka Dano the Mano, said he owned the correct pressing.  I haven&#39;t seen him around in a while though, I don&#39;t have his email, and I never bookmarked his website.

Just something I noticed.  In the column that says the name of the user who submitted the CD the name says &#34;<A HREF="mailto:nevistar@..">nevistar@..</A>.&#34; something something dot com.  Isn&#39;t Nevistar one of those star trainers like RNA?  Maybe you should e-mail him or something and ask for the subcode.

 My next attempt: Deleting or moving Entries in the session. &#34;How much difference does it cause?&#34; <BR> <BR>I am going to take the original Beck CD, and delete the last entry from the session, and change it to &#34;ToC Entries=14&#34;, and see what monster it changes to.

 Well, that didn&#39;t go well. MR2 wouldn&#39;t read the CD. I just sat there on &#34;&#40;Checking the CD now...&#41;&#34;. So I put the MR2 CD back in, and when the monster came out, it was the fabled Stripe Shell &#40;see niton/kato thread in this forum&#41;. <BR> <BR>This time, I will not delete any of the entries. I know that in the ALBA# for every Entry is 150, so we can count that out, as far as changing monsters or stats. I&#39;m going to see if I can change some info in the first Entry, and see what effects it has. Here is what Entry 1 looks like: <BR> <BR>&#91;Entry 1&#93; <BR>Session=1 <BR>Point=0xa1 <BR>ADR=0x01 <BR>Control=0x00 <BR>TrackNo=0 <BR>AMin=0 <BR>ASec=0 <BR>AFrame=0 <BR>ALBA=-150 <BR>Zero=0 <BR>PMin=12 <BR>PSec=0 <BR>PFrame=0 <BR>PLBA=53850 <BR> <BR>Even though it is not the first Entry &#40;0 is first&#41;, this one seems to correspond to an actual audio track on the CD &#40;somehow&#41;. <BR> <BR>I am going to do 3 &#40;possibly 4&#41; CDs for this experiment today. <BR>CD1 - Change the PMin to 11 <BR>CD2 - Change the PSec to 30 <BR>CD3 - Change the Frame to 1 <BR>All other stats will be defaulted after each CD, and if I have enough reason to, then I will make one which includes all 3 the changes. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll be back after each CD to let you know what happens. :&#41;

 Here&#39;s an interesting result. The first CD presents us with a Purple Suezo &#40;Suezo/Naga&#41; with the following Stats: <BR>Lif - 114 <BR>Pow - 121 <BR>Int - 103 <BR>Ski - 162 <BR>Spd - 115 <BR>Def - 120 <BR> <BR>All I changed on this CD was the PMin to 11. 1 whole minute shy of the actual data.

 If you look closely at those #s, you&#39;ll notice that the last digit in each stat is the same #. Anyone want to theorize on that? ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Time to make the next CD. :&#41;

 Thanks Fenrick. We may get a span of info that points to the Monster types, which could be random through the game. The times in the Entries seem to play some part, but we might need an &#39;exact time for the ??? monsters.

 The Purple Suezo again... <BR>OK. There is nothing between Purple Suezo and Mum Mew at this time location.

 And yet again, a CD that won&#39;t register in MR2.

Then I may have to fiddle with seconds, or even radically change the numbers. I&#39;ll see if there is much difference between Entry 0 and Entry 1 by swapping the numbers, also.

 Why don&#39;t you try taking a /??? monster and slightly altering it?  Or a dragon would probably work better instead of the mum mew.  The reason is because people have gotten monsters that are really close to being the rare &#40;starting off with the extra move&#41; but aren&#39;t quite there.  Such as hengersrocks tiger or Lisa&#39;s worm.

 Why don&#39;t you see if you can take a few rares that run in a row like the pixie Rares and see if you can figure out if the Rares are hardcoded into the game? In other words, see if the game checks for one specific set of data then pulls the rare out of a dataset on the game cd. <BR>The game undoubtedly does something like this to determine breeds &#40;i.e. the skins&#41;. And it seems to me that they would save the most space by placing the rares in a CVF and setting flags for the game to go there when it hits that specific number or numbers.

 Well, I think the tests from yesterday at least prove that the main &#39;non-rare&#39; monsters are in no particular order if modifying the info. I&#39;m going to go ahead and mix my next experiment with mepersoner&#39;s idea. I&#39;m going to take either Time Noise &#40;4 Entries&#41; or an audio CD with as few tracks as possible, and change the info of the 1st or 2ns Entry by a second in each direction, and see if that gives us any info. I&#39;ll try Time Noise first. Here&#39;s the Entry I&#39;ll be modifying: <BR> <BR>&#91;Entry 0&#93; <BR>Session=1 <BR>Point=0xa0 <BR>ADR=0x01 <BR>Control=0x04 <BR>TrackNo=0 <BR>AMin=0 <BR>ASec=0 <BR>AFrame=0 <BR>ALBA=-150 <BR>Zero=0 <BR>PMin=1 <BR>PSec=32 <BR>PFrame=0 <BR>PLBA=6750 <BR> <BR>I will do one CD -1sec, and 1 CD &#43;1sec.

 Oooops, I forgot that the last CD I read was Boys II Men&#39;s &#34;Cooleyhighharmony&#34;. This CD will be a while. In the meantime, I&#39;m going to play Triple Play PS2. :&#41;

 OK, I&#39;m not having any luck at all making game CDs that give a new monster, while changing the info. So, what I&#39;m going to do, is take the Shania Twain &#34;Woman In Me&#34; CD, and use that one. Since it is the last rare Pixie CD, I&#39;m going to modify Entry 2 by adding 1 second. I&#39;ll be back to let you know what happens.

 Also, every monster I&#39;ve scanned in CloneCD, the PLBA of Entry 0 is always one of those 2 numbers. I haven&#39;t seen it vary at all. <BR> <BR>Also, you forgot to mention the time difference for Tecno Dragon. Audio CDs will always show up as PMin=1 and PSec=0, but any PlayStation game will come up as PMin=1 and PSec=32. <BR> <BR>Also, when modifying the numbers even one second, I&#39;m noticing that the monsters aren&#39;t in order. It also seems like there is a bigger difference between montsers if I change the higher Entries&#39; times.

 OK, I&#39;m reading over the topic again, and I noticed that I only did the PSuezo/MMew experiment by subtracting. Now I&#39;m going to go the opposite direction, and add. <BR> <BR>I will add 1 minute to PMin in Entry 1 for starters, changing it from 12 to 13. Also, Entry 0 seems to be a CD Lead-in track, and modifying the times in it make it unreadable by the game. <BR> <BR>Not only that, but I&#39;ve already used up 2 CDs on the previous experiment &#40;CD21 &amp; CD22&#41;, and got the old stat Mum Mew on both of them. I will eventually try the Mia experiment on this CD. &#40;adding and subtracting 1 PSec from the very last Entry&#41;
